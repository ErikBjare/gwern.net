[Iodine deficiency](!Wikipedia) is interesting from the ethical standpoint as one of the most cost-effective - yet obscure - [public health](!Wikipedia) measures ever devised which deserves a name like [nootropics](!Wikipedia): a few pennies of iodine added to salt eliminates many cases of mental retardation & goiters.

# Background

Supplementation during pregnancy or infancy can raise average IQs in the worst-off regions by as much as 13 IQ points[^meta] (close to a full standard deviation). In an additional bonus for our post-feminist society, females benefit more from iodization than males[^females]. Because salt production is generally so centralized as a bulk commodity extracted from a very few areas, iodization is almost trivial to implement. (Although humans being humans, there are obstacles even to successful iodization programs[^Kazakhstan].)

    > Thirty-seven reported studies, total 12,291 children, were analysed. The effect size was an increase of 0.83, 0.82, and 0.32 SIQP respectively, for the children living in IS communities compared with those living in ID areas with no iodine supplementation, with inadequate iodine supplementation, or children who had received iodine during their mothers' pregnancy and after birth. These equal to 12.45, 12.3, 4.8 IQ points. Compared with that of children whose mothers were persistently exposed to ID, the total effect size of the 21 entries was an increase of 0.58 SIQP (8.7 IQ points) in the group receiving iodine supplementation during pregnancy. Furthermore, there was an increase on 1.15 SIQP of Binet or 0.8 SIQP on Raven Scale (17.25 or 12 IQ points) for children born more than 3.5 years after iodine supplementation program was introduced. The level of iodine nutrition plays a crucial role in the intellectual development of children. The intelligence damage of children exposed to severe ID was profound, demonstrated by 12.45 IQ points loss and they recovered 8.7 IQ points with iodine supplementation or IS before and during pregnancy

    > In a recently published paper, Erica Field, Omar Robles, and Maximo Torero study the effects of iodine deficiency on educational attainment in Tanzania ([Field, Robles and Torero 2009](http://econweb.umd.edu/~nguyen-q/spring09/Field%20et%20al%20(2007).pdf "Iodine deficiency and schooling attainment in Tanzania")). Theirs is the first published paper to link economically significant outcomes to iodine deficiency, and it supports the idea of improved schooling outcomes after iodine supplementation. Interestingly, Field et al. also find bigger effects for females, which could be due either to biological differences or differences associated with intra-household resource allocation and social responses to increased cognition of males and females.

    The original:

    > Our findings suggest that reducing fetal IDD has significant benefits for child cognition: Children who receive iodine in utero attain an average of 0.33 years of education above siblings and older and younger children in their district. Furthermore, the effects appear to be substantially larger for girls, consistent with new evidence from laboratory studies in animals indicating greater cognitive sensitivity of the female fetus to in utero iodine deprivation, including sex-specific responses to maternal thyroid hormone restriction on  expression of neural thyroid hormone receptors. The results are consistent across household and district fixed effects models and patterns of variation in estimated effects are consistent with predictions regarding the  vulnerability of specific subpopulations to fetal IDD. Cross-country regression estimates indicate a strong negative influence of total goiter rate and strong positive influence of salt iodization on female school participation.
[^Kazakhstan]: An example of the commercial opposition or conspiracy theorists is the Kazakhstan campaign; from ["In Raising the World's I.Q., the Secret's in the Salt"](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html?pagewanted=all), _NYT_:

    > In fact, Kazakhstan has become an example of how even a vast and still-developing nation like this Central Asian country can achieve a remarkable public health success. In 1999, only 29% of its households were using iodized salt. Now, 94% are. Next year, the United Nations is expected to certify it officially free of iodine deficiency disorders...Largely out of the public eye, they made terrific progress: 25% of the world's households consumed iodized salt in 1990. Now, about 66% do.
    >
    > ...In some nations, iodization becomes tarred as a government plot to poison an essential of life — salt experts compare it to the furious opposition by 1950s conservatives to fluoridation of American water. In others, civil libertarians demand a right to choose plain salt, with the result that the iodized kind rarely reaches the poor. Small salt makers who fear extra expense often lobby against it. So do makers of iodine pills who fear losing their market. Rumors inevitably swirl: iodine has been blamed for AIDS, diabetes, seizures, impotence and peevishness. Iodized salt, according to different national rumor mills, will make pickled vegetables explode, ruin caviar or soften hard cheese. Breaking down that resistance takes both money and leadership...The country's biggest salt company was initially reluctant to cooperate, fearing higher costs, a Unicef report said. Cardiologists argued against iodization, fearing it would encourage people to use more salt, which can raise blood pressure. More insidious, Dr. Sharmanov said, were private companies that sold iodine pills. "They promoted their products in the mass media, saying iodized salt was dangerous," he said, shaking his head...Asked about the Unicef report saying that Aral Tuz initially resisted iodization on the grounds that it would eat up 7% of profits, the company's president, Ontalap Akhmetov, seemed puzzled. "I've only been president three years," he said. "But that makes no sense." The expense, he said, was minimal. "Only a few cents a ton."
    >
    > ...In the 1990s, when the campaign for iodization began, the world's greatest concentration of iodine-deficient countries was in the landlocked former Soviet republics of Central Asia. All of them — Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan — saw their economies break down with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Across the region, only 28% of all households used iodized salt. "With the collapse of the system, certain babies went out with the bathwater, and iodization was one of them," said Alexandre Zouev, chief Unicef representative in Kazakhstan...That combination is missing in many nations where iodine deficiency remains a health crisis. In nearby Pakistan, for instance, where 70% of households have no iodized salt, there are more than 600 small salt producers.

> Providing iodine capsules to pregnant mothers is an intervention that helps brain development in fetuses. It costs around 51 cents per dose - and leads to kids who stay in school about five months longer because they are cognitively better able to learn.

The original waves of iodization caused large-scale changes in: numbers of people going to school[^Switzerland], their occupation[^Switzerland-2], how they [voted](http://www.uncg.edu/bae/econ/seminars/2012/Bednar.pdf "'Cognitive Ability and Voting: How Salt Influenced Elections in the 20th Century', Adhvaryu et al 2012"), or even how many recruits from a region are accepted to selective flight schools[^Feyrer].

    > ...Figure 1 illustrates the geographic distribution of goiter in the US as measured among World War I recruits (we discuss the data further below). In 1924 iodized salt was introduced in the United States explicitly to reduce the goiter rate. This intervention rapidly reduced the incidence of iodine deficiency. Iodization of salt in the US provides a particularly good natural experiment due to the geographic distribution of the disease combined with a rapid, complete treatment. Since there are large in utero effects of iodine deficiency, we should see a significant difference between those born before and after the introduction of iodized salt in locations with low levels of environmental iodine. Those living in high iodine regions provide a control group...The probability of assignment to the Air Corps rises significantly in low iodine (i.e. high goiter) counties in the years after the introduction of iodized salt. In the lowest iodine regions, our estimates suggest a 10-20% increase in the probability of a man being assigned to the Air Corps after iodization. Using information about average scores of Air and Ground Force recruits we can infer a one-quarter to one half standard deviation increase in average test scores in these regions. The average level of iodine deficiency in the US was significantly lower than in the highest regions, so the overall effect in the US was much more modest, though iodization was undoubtedly extremely cost effective. The increase in cognitive ability due to salt iodization may have contributed a small amount to trend rise in measured IQ that took place over the course of the twentieth century, the so-called [Flynn Effect](!Wikipedia)...[Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004)](http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v86y2004i2p586-601.html "Returns to Birthweight") find that differences in birth weight among identical twins are reflected in differences in school attainment and adult earnings...More cites to be added, including Case & Paxson.

    > Typically, non-deficient populations differ from iodine-deficient populations by approximately 10 IQ points, whereas the whole normal IQ distribution of a population shifts to the left as a result of iodine deficiency^7^. In endemic areas, cretinism can affect up to 15% of the population (de Benoist et al., eds 2004). Bleichrodt and Born (1994) estimate that the average IQ of iodine-deficient groups is 13.5 points lower than the non-deficient groups...[Scrimshaw (1998)](http://www.idpas.org/pdf/261Malnutritionbrain.pdf "Malnutrition, Brain Development, Learning and Behavior")  provides a list of studies and experiments that have been conducted, and which have shown the hindering effects on mental development of iodine deficiency in utero.

    > ...It had been documented that large amounts of iodine could cause hyperthyroidism to develop in some adults and [thyrotoxicosis](!Wikipedia) in others...thyrotoxicosis might occur as a result of iodization in those individuals that have suffered from long-term iodine deficiency and whose goiters have become nodular. In such cases, iodine supplementation causes the output of hormone to jump to toxic levels...The number of enlisted men started increasing in 1942, and it peaked in the second semester of that year, as well as the first semester of 1943. People born after iodization enlisted in large numbers starting the first semester of 1943. The proportion of recruits going to the Air Force was particularly low in 1943...How large are these effects? The highest goiter places have goiter rates of 30. The coefficients (from Table 4) suggest that about 15% more recruits from the highest goiter regions go into the AAF after salt iodization. From Appendix A we know that the Air Force recruits have, on average 9 point higher AGCT scores (almost a half a standard deviation). The average increase for the recruits from that section is therefore 0.15 time 9 points, or 1.35. So the average cognitive ability in the section goes up by greater than one twentieth of a standard deviation. Examining the high-low regressions yields similar figures. In the high goiter group, we have a 5-10% higher assignment rate to the AAF after salt iodization. 10% times 8 AGCT points results in 0.8 points higher on average, or about a twentieth of a standard deviation. This implies a twentieth of a standard deviation increase in cognitive ability for 25% of the US population.

    > I identify the impact of iodization in three ways: first, in a differences-in-differences framework, I exploit geographic variation in iodine deficiency, as well as the fact that the nationwide campaign to decrease iodine deficiency began in 1922. Second, I use spatial and temporal variation in the introduction of iodized salt across Swiss cantons, and examine whether the level of iodized salt sales at the time of one's birth affected one's educational attainment. Third, I employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design and use jumps in sales of iodized salt across Swiss cantons to identify the effect of iodization, by comparing outcomes for those born right before and right after these sudden changes in the treatment environment. These approaches indicate that the eradication of iodine deficiency in previously deficient areas increased the schooling of the population significantly. The effects are larger for females than for males, which is consistent with medical evidence showing that women are more likely to be affected by iodine deficiency disorders than men.
[^Switzerland-2]: Politi 2011, ["The effects of the generalized use of iodized salt on occupational patterns in Switzerland"](http://www.econ.ed.ac.uk/papers/pap3_swiss_occ.pdf)

Of course, iodine can be a double-edged sword. Feyrer et al 2008 mentioned a wave of disorders after iodization of salt, as long-deficient thyroids were shocked with adequate levels of iodine, and natural iodine levels can be so high as to begin to inversely correlate with IQ in China.[^too-much-of-a-muchness]

[^too-much-of-a-muchness]: ["Effects of drinking water with high iodine concentration on the intelligence of children in Tianjin, China"](http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/1/32.full) ([slides](http://www.sph.cuhk.edu.hk/asiaphconference2009/conference_materials/concurrent%20session/Session%20C/SessionC_LLam.pdf)), Liu et al 2009:

    > The results indicated that for children who resided in regions with a very high water iodine concentration, there was on average a reduction of IQ by nearly nine points (b = −8.7, 95% CI: −15.9 to −1.4) in comparison with those who resided in a non-high water iodine area. When comparing children living in areas with a high water iodine concentration with those in the non-high areas, a slight reduction of IQ by about two points was observed, however, it was not significant. There was also a significant association between year of birth and IQ, which seemed to exhibit a dose-response relationship. There was a progressive increase in IQ by about four (_p_=0.072) and eight (_p_=0.015) points for children born in 1996 and 1997 when compared with those who were born in 1995, the year China first implemented the national dietary iodine supplement programme.

More worrisome is recent trends in the developed world such as the War on Salt. Uniodized salt or low-iodide salt like sea salt is ever more popular. Existing iodized table salt often has far less iodide than recommended, or even what the manufacturer claims it has^[Analyzed 88 samples; 47 fell below USFDA recommended level and their labeled level: Dasgupta PK, Liu Y, Dyke JV. ["Iodine nutrition: iodine content of iodized salt in the United States"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es0719071)]. Iodized salt used in cooking - as opposed to a straight table-side condiment - loses large chunks of its iodine content^[Salt in cooking meat loses ~60% of iodine; Wang GY, Zhou RH, Wang Z, Shi L, Sun M. [Effects of storage and cooking on the iodine content in iodized salt and study on monitoring iodine content in iodized salt](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442215)]. Small samples of ordinary people turn in severe or mild iodine deficiency rates of 67%^[["Iodine status of UK schoolgirls: a cross-sectional survey"](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960693-4/abstract), Vanderpump et al 2011; see also ["The prevalence of iodine deficiency in women of reproductive age in the United States of America"](http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=1463440), Hollowell et al 2007] to as much as 73.7%^[Gunton JE, Hams G, Fiegert M, McElduff A. [Iodine deficiency in ambulatory participants at a Sydney teaching hospital: is Australia truly iodine replete?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10615339).]. This is plausible given a steady secular trend of iodine reduction in the US (although one that seems to have paused in the 2000s)[^iodine-reduction]. I was unsurprised to read [Morse 2012](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm "Benefits of Docosahexaenoic Acid, Folic Acid, Vitamin D and Iodine on Foetal and Infant Brain Development and Function Following Maternal Supplementation during Pregnancy and Lactation"):

> Numerous population studies from a variety of countries including China, Hong Kong, Iran, India, Kyrgyzstan and England have reported iodine deficiency in girls of child bearing age [76](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B76-nutrients-04-00799), in pregnant [154](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B154-nutrients-04-00799),[155](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B155-nutrients-04-00799),[156](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B156-nutrients-04-00799),[157](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B157-nutrients-04-00799), and in pregnant and lactation women [158](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B158-nutrients-04-00799),[159](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B159-nutrients-04-00799). Some of these studies included regions where salt iodization is practiced, yet a significant proportion of pregnant and lactating women were still deficient [155](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B155-nutrients-04-00799),[156](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B156-nutrients-04-00799),[157](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B157-nutrients-04-00799),[158](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B158-nutrients-04-00799),[159](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B159-nutrients-04-00799),[160](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B160-nutrients-04-00799),[161](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/4/7/799/htm#B161-nutrients-04-00799). A few examples of recent studies follow...

[^iodine-reduction]: Hoption Cann SA. [Hypothesis: dietary iodine intake in the etiology of cardiovascular disease](http://www.jacn.org/content/25/1/1.full):

    > In the general United States (US) population, a declining trend in urinary iodine levels has been observed as estimated through the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I, 1971-74; and NHANES III, 1988-94) [3]. The proportion of the US population with moderate to severe iodine deficiency (<50 μg iodine/L in urine) has more than quadrupled in the last 20 years, 2.6% in NHANES I vs 11.7% in NHANES III [3]. This decline may be due to a reduced intake of iodized salt. For example, Enstrom et al. [4] compared data from nationally representative samples of the American population from two time periods, 1980-1982 vs 1990-1992. Based on dietary intake studies from over 10,000 individuals, no change was observed in sodium intake from food, while there was a 65% decline in sodium intake from discretionary (iodized) salt. Adventitious sources of iodine have also declined with reductions in the use of iodine in the dairy industry and in commercial bread production [5]. Comparable trends have been observed in other countries that iodize salt. For example, public health recommendations to reduce salt intake have been implicated in the decreasing iodine status in Australia and New Zealand [6]. Similarly, a recent decline in median urinary iodine levels in Austria may be due to lower salt intake as well as the availability of noniodized salt in Austria after joining the European Union in 1995 [7]. In Greenland, as imported foods have replaced consumption of traditional foods such as fish and sea mammals, there has been a gradual decline in iodine status. Andersen et al. [8] found that median urinary iodine excretion declined with the degree of decrease in the traditional lifestyle. Evidence of iodine deficiency was seen in non-Inuit subjects, who had the lowest levels. Thus, in countries where there are changing dietary patterns, including those long established iodization programs, significant declines in iodine intake may occur.

# Meta-analysis

Given all this, one naturally wonders what the effect might be in older humans: elementary school age and above. If iodine before birth can be responsible for increasing IQ by a full standard deviation or more in combination with iron, what about iodine post-birth? Iron supplementation treats [anemia](!Wikipedia) and [there is evidence](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1475-2891-9-4.pdf "'The effects of oral iron supplementation on cognition in older children and adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis', Falkingham et al 2010") it also treats the cognitive problems as well, so what about iodine?

Unfortunately, no study of the issue is so large and high-quality that it definitively resolves our question. So we resort to [meta-analysis](!Wikipedia): pooling many studies together to derive a summary average of the overall results, weighted by how many subjects each study had (since more is better) versus how strong a result they yielded.

While iodine has been extensively studied, this is a narrow question which many studies do not consider (a common problem in nootropics); we are interested in cases only where someone is mentally tested before and after iodine supplementation, or where 1 cohort receives supplementation after birth when compared against a similar cohort who receive no supplementation. Most studies turn out to be either correlational (eg. stratifying by blood levels of thyroid hormone) or comparing fetal supplementation against a non-supplemented control group.

I currently know of these studies involving post-birth effects which I considered for use:

1. ["Neurological damage to the fetus resulting from severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy"](/docs/1971-pharoah.pdf), Pharoah et al 1971; ["The effect of iodine prophylaxis on the incidence of endemic cretinism"](/docs/1972-pharoah.pdf), Pharoah et al 1972; ["Fetal iodine deficiency and motor performance during childhood"](/docs/1979-connolly.pdf), Connolly et al 1979; ["A controlled trial of iodinated oil for the prevention of endemic cretinism: a long-term follow-up"](/docs/1987-pharoah.pdf), Pharoah & Connolly 1987; a 1966 Papua New Guinea trial which in 1972 began supplementing the control group as well (who were now 0-6 years old); at the 1982 followup, the control group still suffered cretinism and deficits compared to the experimental - no effect. These studies turn out to not test the adults or children born before iodization and so are not useful for our purpose.
2. ["Prophylaxis of endemic goiter with iodized oil in rural Peru"](/docs/1972-pretell.pdf), Pretell et al 1972; ["Iodine deficiency and the maternal-fetal relationship"](/docs/1974-pretell.pdf), Pretell et al 1974: a 1966 Peru trial; females (<45 years old) and males (<18 years old); experimental infants did not outperform control infants - no effect. These studies turn out to not test the adults or children born before iodization and so are not useful for our purpose.

(My above searches & review turned out to be partially redundant with a review that was published online a few months afterwards, in June 2012: Zimmerman's ["The Effects of Iodine Deficiency in Pregnancy and Infancy"](/docs/2012-zimmerman.pdf). Regardless, the above was still useful because Zimmerman's focus was not on any childhood or adult effects but the pregnancy & infancy effects. I have also benefited from ["Iodine intake in human nutrition: a systematic literature review"](http://www.foodandnutritionresearch.net/index.php/fnr/article/view/19731/24399 "Gunnarsdottir & Dahl 2012"))

Unfortunately, a few of the useful studies also tested a variety of substances, so any estimate of iodine's effect size (such as it is) would be an overestimate: the iodine might be synergizing with one of the other ingredients (eg. [selenium](!Wikipedia)) or the iodine might not be the responsible agent at all! But what implications can we draw out via a [meta-analysis](!Wikipedia)? First, the data from the surviving studies:

[^Bautista-reverse-engineering]: Bautista did not report standard deviations, but did report _n_s, means, and _p_-values, which permits the standard deviation to be derived, following the _Cochrane Handbook_ (["7.7.3.3 Obtaining standard deviations from standard errors, confidence intervals, t values and P values for differences in means"](http://www.cochrane.org/handbook/7733-obtaining-standard-deviations-standard-errors-confidence-intervals-t-values-and-p-valu)): the degrees of freedom = 198, so with a reported _p_=0.57, _t_=0.569; then the standard error is the means divided by the t value ($\frac{70.31 - 69.43}{0.569}$); and finally the standard deviation: $\frac{1.55}{sqrt(\frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{100})} = 10.96$.
[^Southon-pooling]: Southon reported control & experimental scores split by gender, which need to be re-pooled:

    - control

        1. $n = 9 + 20 = 29$
        2. mean = $\frac{(60.6 \times 9) + (65.6 \times 20)}{9 + 20} = 64.1$
        3. standard deviation = $\frac{((9-1) \times 2.3) + ((20-1) \times 1.7)}{9 + 20 - 2} =  1.87$

    - active

        1. $n = 10 + 12 = 22$
        2. mean = $\frac{(10 \times 63.4) + (12 \times 64.4)}{10 + 12} = 63.94$
        3. standard deviation = $\frac{((10-1) \times 2.6) + ((12-1) \times 2.6)}{10 + 12 - 2} = 2.6$
[^Isa]: See Table 7; 12 month followup scores are reported grouped in IQ deciles, and if one assumes scores in each decile average to around the median (since they should be following a bell curve, this will overstate standard deviations), one can calculate out the figures in R as follows:

    ~~~{.R}
    # experimental
    sd(c(rep(65,12), rep(75,10), rep(85,17), rep(100,19), rep(115,1), rep(125,1), rep(135,0)))

    [1] 85.25

~~~

So the effect size is, as expected, small: _d_=0.2. A far cry from the _d_>1 which we estimated from the prenatal studies.

The very large difference in _d_ - 0.2 vs 0.6 - between the fixed-effects and random-effects models is concerning. Given the very high heterogeneity of the _i_^2^, which indicates that there are large differences between some of the studies, a random-effects is more appropriate in principle; but further analysis shows this is being driven by a far outlier, and so I believe the fixed-effects estimate of 0.2 is more accurate.

## Moderators: age & dose

We suspected, based on the equivocal results in post-birth studies and the large decline in effect over the duration of a pregnancy in the Chinese studies, that if there was any benefit, it would be in the young; on the same reasoning, we might expect large doses to do more good than smaller ones. The necessary data is encoded into the table already, so we run a meta-analytic regression on them as independent predictors:

~~~{.R}
rma(yi, vi, mods = ~ iodine$age + iodine$dose, data = effects)

Mixed-Effects Model (k = 16; tau^2 estimator: REML)

~~~

Some graphs to help us visualize. Graphing by age, we see what might be a slight negative relationship, as the regression suggests (driven by Shrestha 1994):

![`plot(iodine$age, effects$yi)`](/images/iodine-age.png)

Graphing by dose, we see no relationship at all to my eyes (outliers are Shrestha 1994, again):

![`plot(iodine$dose, effects$yi)`](/images/iodine-dose.png)

The `estimate` is the important part: neither of the moderators seem to have a strong relationship with the cognitive benefits (nor are they at least statistically significant). It would seem that any effectiveness of iodine is unrelated to age and dose. Whether the effectiveness is being driven by a few studies is what we'll look at next.

## Bias checks

16 groups from fewer studies is not enough to reliably check for biases like [publication bias](!Wikipedia), but we can still try. The [funnel plot](!Wikipedia) looks pretty bizarre, with almost all studies tightly bunched around the null effect but 2 outliers - the 2 Shrestha 1994 groups we just saw - showing shockingly high effect sizes of _d_=3.1/4.1. Why did Shrestha 1994 observe such large IQ effects? I don't know, although the Malawi region *was* chosen for its iodine deficiency.

A test & graph:

~~~{.R}
regtest(res1, model = "rma", predictor = "sei", ni = NULL)

model:     mixed-effects meta-regression model
predictor: standard error

# hm, there may be something there... visualize:
funnel(res1)
~~~

![A funnel plot of effect size versus sample size, checking for bias in publishing only good-looking results on iodine](/images/iodine-funnel.png)

So Shrestha 1994 is driving most of the effect! (Not a surprise at this point.)

A trim-and-fill check agrees with us and not the test, by deciding not to add in any new studies between Shrestha and the rest; we also notice that the τ^2^ & _i_^2^ are extremely high, which is just telling us what we know - Shrestha 1994 is different from the other studies:

If we were to redo the analysis but omitting Shrestha 1994, we see a much smaller effect-size:
