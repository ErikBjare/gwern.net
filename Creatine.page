> I attempt to meta-analyze conflicting studies about the cognitive benefits of creatine supplementation. The wide variety of psychological measures hampers any aggregation. 3 studies measured IQ and turn in a positive result, but suggestive of vegetarianism causing half the benefit.

[Creatine](!Wikipedia) is a chemical found throughout the body in a number of roles; it is most famous for its presence in muscles and enabling greater exertion, but it also plays a role in the nervous system. Some small psychology experiments in healthy adults have found cognitive benefits to supplementation but others disagree ([Wikipedia](!Wikipedia "Creatine#Improved cognitive ability"), [Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/#summary6-12)), and these differences may be due to covariates like being vegetarian & hence creatine-deficient.

When small studies conflict, one way to get answers is to try to meta-analyze them into a single more robust summary. In particular, I am interested in whether creatine supplementation increases IQ. One problem here is that the studies may not use enough of the same measures to include in the same meta-analysis; besides that, the studies are likely severely underpowered to detect plausible effects: IQ increases have been often claimed, but have rarely panned out (see, for example, [dual n-back](DNB meta-analysis)) and "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof".

# Background

While creatine is famous for its athletic uses^[The author agrees with creatine's utility for athletics, having [used it](Nootropics#creatine) for that purpose himself.], it turns out to boost mental performance in some circumstances (eg. [Ling et al 2009](http://jtoomim.org/files/Ling_2009-Cognitive_effects_of_creatine_ethyl_ester_supplementation.pdf "Cognitive effects of creatine ethyl ester supplementation") saw the creatine group post-score 4 points higher than controls, or [Watanabe 2002](/docs/creatine/2002-watanabe.pdf "Effects of creatine on mental fatigue and cerebral oxygenation")'s less oxygen use during mental arithmetic; Jonathan Toomim recommends it highly, claiming that "I'm more confident that I've noticed effects [on mental performance] of creatine than of DnB.")

The research results are a little mixed. There are studies showing benefits in:

1. Vegetarians ([Rae 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/pdf/14561278.pdf "Oral creatine monohydrate supplementation improves brain performance: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial"))
2. the sleep-deprived ([McMorris 2006](/docs/creatine/2006-mcmorris.pdf "Effect of creatine supplementation and sleep deprivation, with mild exercise, on cognitive and psychomotor performance, mood state, and plasma concentrations of catecholamines and cortisol"); [McMorris 2007](/docs/creatine/2007-mcmorris-1.pdf "Creatine supplementation, sleep deprivation, cortisol, melatonin and behavior"))
3. the elderly ([McMorris et al 2007](/docs/creatine/2007-mcmorris-2.pdf "Creatine supplementation and cognitive performance in elderly individuals"))

However, [Rawson et al 2008](/docs/creatine/2008-rawson.pdf "Creatine supplementation does not improve cognitive function in young adults") is a broad null result for healthy omnivores, who are probably most of the readers of this FAQ. ([Jonathan Toomim](https://groups.google.com/group/brain-training/msg/5d5ca4de825f7187) has criticized Rawson 2008 as statistically weak and using a possibly not sensitive test of mental performance.)

# Search

Besides the studies I already knew about through discussion, my own research, Wikipedia, or Examine, I also did several searches for additional studies modeled on the search query `creatine AND (IQ OR intelligence OR "Raven's") -mutagen` ('IQ' turns out to be the name of a mutagen which appears in many contexts with [creatine kinase](!Wikipedia)):

- [Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=creatine%20AND%20%28IQ%20OR%20intelligence%20OR%20%22Raven%27s%22%29%20-mutagen): up to pg10 of results
- [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=creatine+AND+%28IQ+OR+intelligence+OR+%22Raven%27s%22%29+-mutagen): up to pg41

- [APA PsycNET](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.searchResults): for just `creatine`, 4 hits

I then set up a Google Alert, a Google Scholar alert, and a Pubmed alert for those searches in case any new studies come out.

# Overview

The searches yielded the following potentially useful studies:

- [Watanabe 2002](/docs/creatine/2002-watanabe.pdf "Effects of creatine on mental fatigue and cerebral oxygenation")
- [Rae 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/pdf/14561278.pdf "Oral creatine monohydrate supplementation improves brain performance: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial")
- [McMorris 2006](/docs/creatine/2006-mcmorris.pdf "Effect of creatine supplementation and sleep deprivation, with mild exercise, on cognitive and psychomotor performance, mood state, and plasma concentrations of catecholamines and cortisol")
- [McMorris 2007](/docs/creatine/2007-mcmorris-1.pdf "Creatine supplementation, sleep deprivation, cortisol, melatonin and behavior")
- [McMorris et al 2007](/docs/creatine/2007-mcmorris-2.pdf "Creatine supplementation and cognitive performance in elderly individuals")
- [Rawson et al 2008](/docs/creatine/2008-rawson.pdf "Creatine supplementation does not improve cognitive function in young adults")
- [Ling et al 2009](http://jtoomim.org/files/Ling_2009-Cognitive_effects_of_creatine_ethyl_ester_supplementation.pdf "Cognitive effects of creatine ethyl ester supplementation")
- [Hammett et al 2010](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/44694983_Dietary_supplementation_of_creatine_monohydrate_reduces_the_human_fMRI_BOLD_signal/file/9fcfd50bb2b9e2fba1.pdf "Dietary supplementation of creatine monohydrate reduces the human fMRI BOLD signal")
- [Benton & Donohoe 2011](http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_161120651.pdf "The influence of creatine supplementation on the cognitive functioning of vegetarians and omnivores")

These use a variety of psychological measures:

Study                      Test
-------------------------  ---------------------
Watanabe 2002              Uchida-Kraepelin serial calculation test
Rae 2003                   Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices; Wechsler Auditory backward digit span
McMorris 2006              Random movement generation (RMG) test; forward verbal recall; backwards verbal recall; 4-choice visual reaction time test; Hemmings mood state inventory
McMorris 2007              Random number generation task; number recall test; four-choice visual reaction time test; Hemmings mood state inventory; NASA-TLX effort sub-scale
McMorris et al 2007        Random number generation task; forward verbal recall; backwards verbal recall; forward Corsi Block Tapping test; backwards Corsi Block Tapping test; long-term memory test
Rawson et al 2008          Simple reaction time; code substitution; code substitution delayed; logical reasoning symbolic; mathematical processing; running memory; Sternberg memory recall
Ling et al 2009            Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices; Memory Scanning task; Number-Pair Matching task; Sustained Attention task; Arrow Flanker task
Hammett et al 2010         Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices; Backwards Digit Span
Benton & Donohoe 2011      Word recall; reaction-time; vigilance rapid information processing task; Controlled Oral Word Association Test

In total, these 9 studies use <=31 distinct measures of cognitive functioning; this heterogeneity renders any summary very difficult as most measures were used in one and only one experiment. The Hemmings mood state inventory, random number generation task, backwards verbal recall, & forward verbal recall are used in 2 experiments each, but the RAPM is used in 3 experiments and would be better to analyze if possible.

# Data

I decided to code multiple relevant variables:

1. diet: if no diet was specified, assume omnivorousness since as little as 5% of Western population are vegetarians

    - 0: omnivore
    - 1: vegan or vegetarian
2. sleep:

    - 0: no mention is made of sleep deprivation
    - 1: if sleep deprivation in the experimental as opposed to control group
3. IQ:

    - 0: RAPM
4. dose: total amount of creatine administered, in grams
5. age: average mean of all subjects' age; medians were treated as means if that was provided instead, and means given of range endpoints if only that was provided

# Results

The 3 studies turn in the expected statistically-significant positive result in the random-effects meta-analysis, due largely to Rae 2003:

~~~{.R}

Q(df = 2) = 1.0259, p-val = 0.5987

When vegetarianism is used as a covariate (this applies only to Rae 2003), the pooled Ling & Hammett estimate is then just barely statistically-significant:

QM(df = 1) = 0.9007, p-val = 0.3426

~~~

Unfortunately, with 3 studies I can't investigate dose meaningfully, nor try to check for publication bias. This leaves me quite skeptical: with more than a decade, have so few studies really been done, or are the proverbial filedrawers bulging with others I couldn't find?

# Study details

Watanabe 2002, McMorris 2006, McMorris et al 2007, McMorris 2007, Rawson et al 2008, Benton & Donohoe 2011: were excluded for not using a measure of intelligence.

## Rae 2003

[Rae et al 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691485/pdf/14561278.pdf "Oral creatine monohydrate supplementation improves brain performance: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial")

> In this work, we tested the hypothesis that oral creatine supplementation (5 g d2 1 for six weeks) would enhance intelligence test scores and working memory performance in 45 young adult, vegetarian subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Creatine supplementation had a significant positive effect ( p , 0.0001) on both working memory (backward digit span) and intelligence (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices), both tasks that require speed of processing.

> Forty-five vegan or vegetarian subjects (12 males (median age of 27.5, range of 19-37 years), 33 females (median age of 24.9, range of 18-40 years); 18 vegan (median duration of 4.6 years, range of 0.7-17 years) and 27 vegetarian (median duration of 14.3, range of 1-23 years)) were recruited with informed consent from among the student population of The University of Sydney

> The study followed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Subjects were seen on four separate occasions, at six-week intervals, following an overnight fast to minimize any fluctuations in blood glucose.

> A cognitive test battery was also administered. At the end of the first and third test sessions, subjects were given an envelope marked with their study number and containing 5 g doses of supplement (creatine monohydrate ((2-methylguanido)acetic acid); Pan Pharmaceuticals, Australia) or placebo (maltodextrin; Manildra Starches, Australia) in plastic vials. Subjects were asked to consume this supplement at the same time each day for the next six weeks and received advice on how best to take this supplement to ensure maximum solubility and absorption. Subjects returned the envelope with unused vials at the end of each six-week period and the number of vials remaining was used to assess compliance, validated against increases in red cell (tissue) creatine. Between visits 2 and 3, the subjects consumed no supplement. Note: six weeks has been shown to be an adequate 'wash-out' period (Harris et al. 1992).

> Subjects completed timed (10 min) parallel versions of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPMs) constructed to have equal levels of difficulty based on the published normative performance data and verified by us on an independent sample of 20 subjects.

> Supplementation with oral creatine monohydrate significantly increased intelligence (as measured by RAPMs done under time pressure, figure 1a) compared with placebo (F3 ,33 = 32.3, p , 0.0001; repeated-measures ANOVA). There was no significant effect of treatment order (F1 ,33 = 1.62, p = 0.21), although there was a significant interaction with treatment order (F3 ,99 = 6.7, p = 0.0004). The mean RAPMs raw score under placebo was 9.7 (s.d. = 3.8) items correct in 10 min versus 13.7 (s.d. = 4.1) items correct under the experimental treatment. Supplementation with oral creatine monohydrate (figure 1b) significantly affected performance on BDS (F3 ,34 = 29.0, p , 0.0001), with no effect of order (F3 ,10 2 = 0.98, p = 0.40). Mean BDS under the placebo was 7.05 items (s.d. = 1.19), compared with a mean of 8.5 items under creatine treatment (s.d. = 1.76).

## Ling 2009

[Ling et al 2009](http://jtoomim.org/files/Ling_2009-Cognitive_effects_of_creatine_ethyl_ester_supplementation.pdf "Cognitive effects of creatine ethyl ester supplementation") saw the creatine group post-score 4 points higher than controls

> There were 34 participants (including 12 females) who completed the study, with a mean age of 21 years (SD: 1.38; range: 18-24). Participants were excluded, if they presented with a medical history of drug and/or alcohol abuse, diagnosed psychiatric disorders, diabetes, renal insufficiency (kidney dysfunction) or had recently or were currently supplementing with a creatine-based substance. None of the participants was vegetarian.

> The final task participants undertook was a modified version of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (e.g. Raven et al., 1998) presented on a PC using Macromedia Flash Player (http://iqtest.dk/main.swf). The difficulty of the 39 questions gradually increased and was constrained by a 40-min time limit.

> At the end of the first testing phase, participants were given a large envelope that contained 15 plastic vials of either 5 g doses of CEE (obtained through the online store Discount Supplements) or a placebo, maltodextrin (obtained from the manufacturer Chemical Nutrition; http://www.cnpprofessional.co.uk).

> There was a significant effect of test phase on performance in the IQ test [F(1,32) = 88.98, P < 0.01] with participants scoring a mean of 112 (SD: 9.44) at baseline, and 118 (7.89) at the end of the study. There was no significant main effect of supplement condition [F(1,32) = 0.56, NS]. However, the interaction was significant [F(1,32) = 81.18, P < 0.01]. Pairwise comparisons indicated that participants in the creatine condition performed worse than the placebo group in the first phase of testing, with baseline means for creatine group of 108 (SD: 7.42) and for placebo, 116 (SD: 9.60) (Tukey HSD, P < 0.01). Performance of the creatine group also improved significantly over the supplementation period, with the mean of 108 at baseline increasing to 120 (SD: 5.95) at the end of study (Tukey HSD, P < 0.01). Further pairwise comparisons indicated that there was no significant improvement in the performance of the placebo group over the supplementation period (P > 0.05).

> Performance of the creatine group also improved significantly over the supplementation period, with the mean of 108 at baseline increasing to 120 (SD: 5.95) at the end of study

## 2010 Hammett

["Dietary supplementation of creatine monohydrate reduces the human fMRI BOLD signal"](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/44694983_Dietary_supplementation_of_creatine_monohydrate_reduces_the_human_fMRI_BOLD_signal/file/9fcfd50bb2b9e2fba1.pdf), Hammett et al 2010; quotes relevant for calculating the variables:

> To establish whether the magnitude of the BOLD response is influenced by Cr levels, we have measured responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual cortex (V1) of 22 healthy human volunteers using fMRI, before and after oral administration of Cr or a placebo (11 in the Cr group and 11 in the placebo group).

> The mean and median age of the Cr group was 30.18 and 27 years (SD = 8.37) respectively and the mean and median age of the placebo group was 25 years (SD = 4.82).

> Creatine supplementation (Sci-Mx: Gloucestershire, UK) was provided at a dose of 20 g/day for five days, followed by two additional days at a dose of 5 g/day.

> In order to verify previous reports of cognitive enhancement following Cr supplementation we also measured performance on the Backwards Digit Span (BDS) [28] and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) [24] prior to each scan. The BDS comprises a set of number sequences of increasing length with two different sequences of each length. Subjects were required to repeat each sequence backwards. The test was terminated when the subject failed to repeat two sequences of the same length. Different number sequences were used for the two testing sessions. Subjects were required to complete as many items of the RAPM as possible in 5 min. Since the RAPM tests are ordered in terms of difficulty, odd-numbered and even-numbered tests were administered on weeks 1 and 2 respectively.

> Performance on the RAPM increased non-significantly by 9.6% following Cr (t = 1.882, df = 10, p = 0.0745) and reduced non-significantly by 4.5% (t = 0.7733, df = 10, p = 0.4572) following placebo. A Group × Week ANOVA revealed a main effect of week (F(1, 20) = 5.75, p = 0.026, two-tailed) and a significant interaction between week and compound (F(1, 20) = 8.58, p = 0.008, two-tailed) for BDS performance. No significant effects were found for RAPM performance.

What's the standard deviation which produces a p-value of 0.0745 on an increase of 9.6% & a sample size of 11 in each group? Simulation, using 5 as a convenient mean score:

~~~{.R}
n <- 10000
mn <- 5
results <- vector(length=n)
for (i in 1:n) {
    while (TRUE) { newSd <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 5);
                   control <- rnorm(11, mean = mn, sd = newSd);
                   active <- 1.096*control;
                   p <- t.test(control, active)$p.value
                   if (p < 0.08 && p > 0.07) { results[i] <- newSd; break; }
                 }
}
