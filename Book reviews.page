# Books

This is a sortable table of books I have read; it is compiled from a [CSV export](/docs/gwern-goodreads.csv) of [my Goodreads account](http://www.goodreads.com/gwern) to Markdown/HTML by [a Haskell script I wrote](/haskell/goodreadsToMarkdown.hs). (The GoodReads interface is too fancy for its own good.)

  *[Radiance: A Novel](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0312311362&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Carter Scholz                    ★★★★★    2003   2014/02/20   (Quotes are extracted from my <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance">annotated ebook edition of <i>Radiance</i></a>; see also my <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#about-radiance">list of other review</a> & <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#reviews-excerpts">excerpts from them</a>.)<br/><br/>Publisher summary:<br/><br/><blockquote>Somewhere in California, in the 1990s, a nuclear weapons lab develops advanced technologies for its post-Cold War mission. Advanced as in <i>not working yet</i>. Mission as in <i>continued funding</i>. A scandal-plagued missile defense program presses forward, dragging physicist Philip Quine deep into the machinations of those who would use the lab for their own gain.<br /><br/><br/>The Soviet Union has collapsed. But new enemies are sought, and new reasons found to continue the work that has legitimized the power of the Lab, its managers, and the politicians who fund them. Quine is thrust into the center of programs born at the intersection of paranoia, greed, and ambition, and torn by incommensurable demands. Deadlines slip and cost overruns mount. He is drawn into a maelstrom of policy meetings, classified documents, petty betrayals, interrupted conversations, missed meanings, unanswered voicemail, stolen data, and pornographic files. Amid all the noise and static of the late twentieth century made manifest in weapons and anti-weapons, human beings have set in motion a malign and inhuman reality, which now is beyond their control.<br /><br/><br/> More than a critique of corrupt science and a permanent wartime economy, <i>Radiance</i> is a novel of lost ideals, broken aspirations, and human costs. In this vivid satire, relationships are just a question of who's using whom. Failure is just another word for opportunity. "Spin" is a property not of atomic particles but of the news cycle. Nature is a blur beyond the windshield, where lives are spent on the road, on the phone, on the make, in fierce competition for financial, political, and intellectual resources. It is a world which language is used to evade, manipulate, and expedite. It is a world where everyone's story is always open to revision and language is used for justifying everything from defense programs to divorce.</blockquote><br/><br/>Years ago, I ran into a book review titled <a href="http://ltimmelduchamp.com/node/84">"'Its awful and enticing radiance': The Beauty and Terror of Carter Scholz's <em>Radiance</em>"</a> by L. Timmel Duchamp; about a 2001 novel I had never heard of by an author I had never heard of, but it sounded interesting and I read the review until towards the end, it quote a key passage in <i>Radiance</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote>A murmur of rain had started again. He lay there in the abyss of his thoughts as her breathing beside him steadied and deepened. Almost a voice stirred in him. It starts before Hanford, it almost said. It starts with Röntgen, with the piece of barium glowing in the path of invisible rays, striking out the fire that God had put there. It starts with his wife's hand on the photographic plate, its transparence there, the ashen bones visible within the milky flesh. Who could imagine that this radiance at the heart of matter could be malign? That with its light came fire? (Yet from the first the ashen bones were there to see within the flesh.) It starts with Becquerel carrying the radium in his pocket that burned his skin, and darkened the unexposed film. It starts with Marie Curie poisoning herself in that pale uncanny glow. With Rutherford guessing at this new alchemy, guessing that matter, giving up its glow, transformed itself one element into another. With the miners at Joachimsthal, deep under the Erzgebirge, inhaling the dust of uranium and dying of "mountain sickness". With women who by the thousands in watch factories tipped their brushes with that glow, touched it to their tongues before painting the dial face, women who only much later, when the watches' glow had faded, sickened and died from that radiance taken into their bones. It begins with Ernest Lawrence rushing across the Berkeley campus, the idea of a proton accelerator uncontainable in his mind, calling out, I'm going to be famous! With Oppenheimer at Jornada del Muerte that morning of Trinity. With the scientists who had prised open the gates to that blazing realm past heaven or hell. What were they now at the Lab in all their thousands, but the colonial bureaucrats of that realm, the followers and functionaries, the clerks and commissars? Mere gatekeepers of that power. Or in its keeping. It goes of its own momentum beyond Hanford, to Trinity, to Hiroshima, to the prisoners, the cancer patients, the retarded children, the pregnant women injected or fed this goblin matter to see would it bring health or sickness, the soldiers huddled in trenches against the flash, bones visible in their arms through closed eyes, staring up at the roiling cloudrise, the sheepherders, the farms, the homes, the gardens downwind. And in his sleep the voice long stilled spoke once more. It starts with Sforza; <i>in case of need I will make bombards, mortars, and firethrowing engines of beautiful and practical design. It starts with Archimedes focusing the sun's rays upon the fleet at Syracuse, it starts with the first rock hurled by the first grasping hand. It starts where we start. It is mind, it is hunger, it is greed, it is defense, it is mischief, it is the devil, it is the god; it is life.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>The force of the incantation struck me and a few years later, a copy finally appeared in my local library system. I requested it and devoured it in one or two sittings; Scholz's favored punctuation-less style, using hyphens for voice transitions, annoyed me (but did not challenge me - I'd already read <i>Stand On Zanzibar</i> & Dos Passos's <i>U.S.A.</i>). The swirl of references drenched the work in reality - Scholz seems to know everything about everything, from philosophy of science to the L5 Society to Wagner's <i>Parsifal</i>, but the themes were grand and ones 'modern literature' so often fails to address and cedes to science fiction: the role of science in society, the tension between future gains and present losses, what is corruption, whether we live up to our own standards, the worth of truth...<br/><br/><br/>You could only call it a satire if you didn't realize how closely it all tracks to real events: it is a roman à clef of the Star Wars program, down to the nuclear tests which intrude onto 5 pages in the final section. (Scholz seems to have drawn heavily on <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends">Gregory Benford's autobiographical essay "Old Legends"</a>, included in the anthology the "Radiance" novella was first published in.)<br/><br/><br/>The novel begins in media res, depicting a failed exorcism of the government labs, quickly turning to its protagonist, a good-natured but despairing and baffled Quine's attempts to understand his predicament: in charge of designing a nuclear weapon where the data simply disagrees with the theory which is supposed to be right. The story unravels into one of deception and funding pressure, and Quine triumphs, unseating the culprit in it all, and realizing he doesn't belong at the labs - "I belong inside!" he says, even as he is forced out in the turmoil of anti-nuclear protesters.<br/><br/><br/>A hallmark of <i>Radiance</i> is the Gibsonian sense of alien entities and organisms clashing for life, at a level above individuals: the Labs has generated its own culture, with its own imperatives and loyalties and goals, fed by government money, but in this respect, we can say little better of the continual antagonist of the labs, the protesters, as it is its own alien entity, seeking funding for its protests (funding, Réti reminds us, comes from the enemy), subverting Lab members for information, pressuring characters like Lynn to serve it. And it doesn't end there: the Pentagon lurks in the background, represented by Reese, quietly pushing along research into ever better nuclear weapons, and hinted at twice are foreign governments like North Korea, and beyond that? Here I borrow a term from Kevin Kelly and refer to the Technium: science and technology regarded as its own entity with its own drives and selection effects, including the proliferation of all forms of technology.<br/><br/><br/>Section two turns to the unseated Highet: his ouster, and the epilogue of his story as he looks over the ruins of his life and seeks out a final resting place in a think-tank. The Biblical and Wagnerian overtones are strong in this section. Thinking of <i>Parsifal</i>'s Grail quest, it's hard not to remember that only one knight finds the Holy Grail in the end: the others all go astray or have sinned in various ways.<br/><br/><br/>Section three completes the work. Just like <i>Dune Messiah</i> thoroughly subverted and undermined the simplistic narratives presented for the reader to swallow in <i>Dune</i>, part three shows the reader how Quine in his own turn is fully subverted by the environment, his sense of duty, and yes, his own belief in the desirability of progress. ("He goes right to the point and carries the reader / Into the midst of things, as if known already; / And if there's material that he despairs of presenting / So as to shine for us, he leaves it out; / And he makes his whole poem one. What's true, what's invented, / Beginning, middle, and end, all fit together.") The imagery and parallelism at times is not even subtle: for both Quine and Highet, Scholz arranges for them to at some point limp (just like Edward Teller) and have inflamed reddish faces - the implication could hardly be clearer if one of the characters had been named 'Faust' and Lynn Hamlin renamed Margaret Hamlin.<br/><br/><br/>And finally, having been 'corrupted' (but having succeeded in securing the future of the National Ignition Facility which runs to this day), Quine is dealt the final blow: the revelation of the leak of nuclear test data. The Technium strives toward openness and proliferation. Technology may be amoral but it has imperatives of its own. The book ends in Quine in despair and granted a moment of lucidity: seeing his entire life as a mixture of success and failure, as but a pawn of vast forces beyond his comprehension, beholding the presence of the ghostly Technium, far from exorcised.<br/><br/><blockquote>...he stabbed the radio to silence as the dash blinked JAM and he accelerated into the next lane with the needle climbing past 80 past 90 when the CD player blinked PLAY and a falsetto whined, --gonna be just dirt in the ground --Damn it! Shut up...! banging the dash as his wheels trilled on the raised lane dividers and a horn snapped his head around to the panicked face of another drive too close as he yanked the wheel and the road slid on despite his foot wedged on the brake and the yank of the wheel back against a fishtailing swerve into a chorus of horns and gaping faces traveling sideways past him until the car came up hard against a curb and stopped. He was on the shoulder turned sideways. Through the passenger window he saw traffic rush toward him and pass behind him. Ahead of him, smoke rose from fields of stubble, and a flight of bird, scattered by some disturbance, wheeled, now black, now white, against the empty burning sky.<br/><br/>In the heart of that light, lucid and inevitable, all that was scattered cohered. Superbright and all its progeny stood plain before him in conception and in detail and in its component part and its deepest strategies and in its awful and enticing radiance. He saw the design and the making of that device complete, and of further devices without end, and he stood apart from them as if it mattered not at all whether the deviser was himself or whether they came into being sooner or later. Trembling he stared across the burning fields and whispered, --Stop. Stop. But the traffic rushed on.</blockquote><br/><br/>The 3 sections form closed circle: a tight ball of historical forces, corruption, science, despair, progress, failure, and personal tragedies.<br/><br/><br/>The reader expecting further satire will not be pleased by this section. They've missed the point: this isn't a comedy, it's a tragedy. And what would a tragedy be without there being a great gap between what we hoped a character might accomplish and what actually happens? The higher they can fly, the sadder a crash.<br/><br/><blockquote>Coyote, First Angry, enemy of all law, wanderer, desert mind, outlaw, spoiler, loser, clown, glutton, lecher, thief, cheat, pragmatist, survivor, bricoleur, silver-tongued Taliesin, latterday Leonardo, usurper Sforza, adulterer Lancelot, tell, wily one, by any means, of the man with two hearts, of knowledge and desire safely hidden from each other. Did not Paracelsus command us to falsify and dissimulate so that ignorant men might not look upon our mysteries? Did not the noble da Vinci hide the meaning of his thought by the manner of his script? What man has not two masters, two minds, two hearts? Tell of the man so wounded in himself that he tore his second heart from him and cast it out, naming it the world, and swore to wound it as it had wounded him.</blockquote><br/><br/>It's not as simple as 'good' and 'evil'. It's not even as simple as 'corruption' vs 'honesty': look around. Progress is not inevitable. Athens declined. Florence declined. Countries fall. Knowledge can be lost (look at scurvy). Science is not a formalized process, but a spirit of honesty and inquiry, which can be aped and the wordless teaching lost (how can Japanese or Chinese researchers run hundred of experiments, apparently complying with all known standards, every single one of which concludes acupuncture works, when results elsewhere show dramatically lower success rates?). After WWII, many Americans saw the ruins of Germany and Japan, and took to heart a lesson: the darkness waits. Anti-vaxxers to our left, Creationists to our right. And that's in America, still preeminent in science, still one of the wealthiest countries in the world - based on just that science & technology. Highet is not wrong - just one-sided.<br/><br/><br/>("If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?")<br/><br/><br/>Throughout the book, we know "the work goes on". Another of Scholz's references, this time to alchemy's <i>magnum opus</i>, the philosopher's stone, which grants moral purification, eternal life, and the transmutation of base elements into nobler ones. (Transmutation has been realized as radioactive decay, while modern medicine would astound Bacon, and it does not seem absurd that in the next few centuries mankind will cure aging.) The double aspect pops up again, of fraud and greatness: research as practical work but also as spiritual quest. Another double aspect: alchemists were notorious scam artists & mountebanks, tricking others (particularly secular lords and governments) into funding their researches based on tricks with gold - but Isaac Newton was an alchemist, Robert Boyle based modern chemistry in part on the knowledge painfully gleaned by centuries of alchemists, and the formation of modern states was due in part to gunpowder (Chinese alchemists), and Roger Bacon, who I cannot resist supplying <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ln/resist_the_happy_death_spiral/" title="Eliezer Yudkowsky">an apt quote about</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Once upon a time, there was a man who was convinced that he possessed a Great Idea. Indeed, as the man thought upon the Great Idea more and more, he realized that it was not just <i>a</i> great idea, but <i>the most wonderful idea ever</i>. The Great Idea would unravel the mysteries of the universe, supersede the authority of the corrupt and error-ridden Establishment, confer nigh-magical powers upon its wielders, feed the hungry, heal the sick, make the whole world a better place, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br/><br/>The man was Francis Bacon, his Great Idea was the scientific method, and he was the only crackpot in all history to claim that level of benefit to humanity and turn out to be completely right."</blockquote><br/><br/>It starts with Bacon...<br/><br/><br/>But the traffic rushes on. And the work goes on.


  *[Worm](http://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-01/)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          wildbow                          ★★★★★    2013   2014/08/13   <a href="http://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-01/"><i>Worm</i></a> (<a href="http://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/">Table of Contents</a>/<a href="http://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/">official summary</a>/<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">TvTropes</a>/<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans">Reddit</a>/<a href="http://robbieblair.com/interview-with-worm-author-john-mccrae/">post-interview</a>) is addictive superhero SF posing as fantasy; it is long, of consistently high quality, and features a huge amount of imaginative powers with equally imaginative applications & combos (the protagonist usage of bugs, as impressive as it is, is only one of many possible examples, although I particularly like the Regent & Shadow Stalker incident as an example of social-engineering/hacking); the setting excellently rationalizes the standard superheroes vs supervillains setup (which as often observed, makes little sense prima facie). The series opens in the smallest possible setting, the geeky introverted protagonist Taylor being bullied in school, steps logically towards a life of crime as a supervillain while trying to do the right thing (and being manipulated by multiple parties, some prescient) and slowly expands to multiversal scope with an appropriately epic & bittersweet ending. (Reminds me of <i>Watchmen</i>.) Or to borrow from the official summary:<br/><br/><blockquote>An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life. Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the local ‘cape’ scene’s politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons...Readers should be cautioned that <i>Worm</i> is fairly dark as fiction goes, and it gets far darker as the story progresses. Morality isn’t black and white, Taylor and her acquaintances aren’t invincible, the heroes aren’t winning the war between right and wrong, and superpowers haven’t necessarily affected society for the better. Just the opposite on every count, really. Even on a more fundamental level, Taylor’s day to day life is unhappy, with her clinging to the end of her rope from the story’s outset. The denizens of the Wormverse (as readers have termed it) don’t pull punches, and I try to avoid doing so myself, as a writer. There’s graphic language, descriptions of violence and sex does happen (albeit offscreen).</blockquote><br/><br/>I recommend reading single arcs at a time: calling the whole thing 'Worm' is a bit of a misnomer, it'd make much more sense to group a few arcs and call them individual novels in the 'Worm Saga' or something. Length-wise, it's upwards of a million words, and according to my <a href="http://arbtt.nomeata.de/">arbtt</a> logs (using the rule '<tt>current window \$title =\~ [/.\* Worm - Iceweasel/] ==\> tag Worm</tt>'), took me 37 hours & 42 minutes over 5 days to read.<br/><br/>The work is not perfect. The opening is perhaps too slow: the first fight with Lung, which hooked me, took a while to happen as it only really starts in <a href="http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/gestation-1-4/">ch4</a>. In the middle, I suspect there was perhaps too much material devoted to the Slaughterhouse Nine arc and not enough to later plot arcs like Taylor joining the heroes or dealing with later Endbringers. Further, there's so many characters that a binge read is a good idea, but during a binge, the fights can blur together and become exhausting, suggesting <i>Worm</i> may spend too much time on that. Some good parts, like characters having reasons to be bad, are taken to an extreme where it seems like every character, no matter how mundane, must have a backstory explaining how their environment/society <i>made</i> them evil (even for characters like Emma where such a cause is unnecessary). But the flaws are relatively small and hopefully will be addressed in the editing process. I look forward to reading Wildbow's <i>Pact</i> when it finished, and I think I'll check out some of the fanfics like <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442"><i>Cenotaph</i></a>.<br/><br/>I read <i>Worm</i> after it was finished and I continued to see positive reviews of it, such as <a href="http://hpmor.com/notes/progress-report-2013-11-01/">Eliezer</a> <a href="http://hpmor.com/notes/101/ ">Yudkowsky</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>...I commend to you...the just-completed story <i>Worm</i>, which is roughly 1.75 million words in 30 volumes. The characters in <i>Worm</i> use their powers so intelligently I didn't even notice until something like the 10th volume that the alleged geniuses were behaving like actual geniuses and that the flying bricks who would be the primary protagonists and villains of lesser tales were properly playing second fiddle to characters with cognitive, informational, or probability-based powers...Doing this so smoothly that I don't even notice because my brain considers the resulting world to be 'normal' really ought to deserve some kind of epic bonus points....There are stories which are better than <i>Worm</i>, and stories which were written faster than <i>Worm</i>, but I don't know of any epic which was ever written faster and better than <i>Worm</i>.</blockquote><br/><br/>Other reviews include <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ird/october_2013_media_thread/9v61">Joshua Blaine</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>...a self consistent and expansive Super-hero universe, and with <i>a ton</i> of unique and powerful abilities, I've really been enjoying it. The story is Worm, and It's easily one of my favorite web stories in awhile, and very dark (especially as the story progresses further).</blockquote><br/><br/><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/iy8/november_2013_media_thread/9zqz">iDante</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>I've been reading this awesome web serial called Worm. Highly recommend if you want some action and suspense. There's a bit of rationality business in there as well, but it's spaced out and the story is long. I see it's been recommended previously on here as well.</blockquote><br/><br/><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/iy8/november_2013_media_thread/9zrh">Vaniver</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>Caveat: Worm is <i>really dark</i>. The characters are clever, the protagonist makes the most out of a superpower that seems mediocre at first glance, and there are enough twists and turns that I would look at the clock and realize that I'd been reading for six hours. (Worm is <i>really long</i>, so if you're the sort of person who has to keep reading fiction be warned that it will eat a week or two.) But, despite those positives, terrible things happen to everyone always. I found it similar to Game of Thrones in that it was engaging but depressing, and unlike GoT where new characters are introduced, dance about, and then die, in Worm there's a clear protagonist who, as far as I can tell, always wins eventually. I also found the superhero fight sequences less engaging as time went on - but they can be skimmed with little loss.</blockquote><br/><br/>and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jya/rationalist_fiction_a_slice_of_life_in_hell/aqa0">Ritalin</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>Indeed. Although, frankly, what I've seen of Worm so far seems to designate it as very similar to my idea of Hell; every accomplishment is either made moot or cost something irreplaceable and possibly of superior value, every victory is short-lived, every mistake is paid for dearly. Every situation is desperate, every problem urgent. By the time a conflict reaches its resolution, another is at its peak, and two more are right around the corner. Perhaps it's even worse; hardship, instead of building character, corrupts it. For the characters, it must be like a nightmare they can't wake up from.</blockquote><br/>


  *[Urne Burial](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0141023910&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Thomas Browne                    ★★★★★    2005   2012/07/14   I first heard of Browne in Borges - as so often - in the ending of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" where the narrator is attempting to translate it into Spanish. Borges is always interested in translation (see for example his fantastic essay on translating the <i>1001 Nights</i>) and I made a note to look up this work which presented such challenges for rendering into Spanish. (The actual edition I used was James Eason's <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/hydrionoframes/hydrion.html">online edition</a>.)<br/><br/><i>Urn Burial</i> is hugely archaic, but also amazing. I am not sure where I have last seen any literary pyrotechnics to match Browne in English. David Foster Wallace sometimes approaches him, but beyond that I draw blanks. The book defies any simple summary as many passages are cryptic tangles and Browne says many things. So I will not try, and simply present some passages that struck me:<br/><br/><blockquote>"He that lay in a golden Urne eminently above the Earth, was not likely to finde the quiet of these bones. Many of these Urnes were broke by a vulgar discoverer in hope of inclosed treasure. The ashes of <i>Marcellus</i> were lost above ground, upon the like account. Where profit hath prompted, no age hath wanted such miners. For which the most barbarous Expilators found the most civill Rhetorick. Gold once out of the earth is no more due unto it; What was unreasonably committed to the ground is reasonably resumed from it: Let Monuments and rich Fabricks, not Riches adorn mens ashes. The commerce of the living is not to be transferred unto the dead: It is not injustice to take that which none complains to lose, and no man is wronged where no man is possessor."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"If the nearnesse of our last necessity, brought a nearer conformity unto it, there were a happinesse in hoary hairs, and no calamity in half senses. But the long habit of living indisposeth us for dying; When Avarice makes us the sport of death; When even David grew politickly cruell; and Solomon could hardly be said to be the wisest of men. But many are too early old, and before the date of age. Adversity stretcheth our dayes, misery makes Alcmenas nights, and time hath no wings unto it. But the most tedious being is that which can unwish it self, content to be nothing, or never to have been, which was beyond the male-content of Job, who cursed not the day of his life, but his Nativity; Content to have so farre been, as to have a title to future being; Although he had lived here but in an hidden state of life, and as it were an abortion."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"Nature hath furnished one part of the Earth, and man another. The treasures of time lie high, in Urnes, Coynes, and Monuments, scarce below the roots of some vegetables. Time hath endlesse rarities, and shows of all varieties; which reveals old things in heaven, makes new discoveries in earth, and even earth it self a discovery. That great Antiquity <i>America</i> lay buried for a thousand years; and a large part of the earth is still in the Urne unto us."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"Some bones make best Skeletons, some bodies quick and speediest ashes: Who would expect a quick flame from Hydropicall <i>Heraclitus</i>? The poysoned Souldier when his Belly brake, put out two pyres in <i>Plutarch</i>. But in the plague of <i>Athens</i>, one private pyre served two or three Intruders; and the <i>Saracens</i> burnt in large heaps, by the King of <i>Castile</i>, shewed how little Fuell sufficeth. Though the Funerall pyre of <i>Patroclus</i> took up an hundred foot, a peece of an old boat burnt <i>Pompey</i>; And if the burthen of <i>Isaac</i> were sufficient for an holocaust, a man may carry his owne pyre."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"The long habit of living indisposeth us for dying."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"To be content that times to come should only know there was such a man, not caring whether they knew more of him, was a frigid ambition in Cardan: disparaging his horoscopal inclination and judgement of himself, who cares to subsist like Hippocrates Patients, or Achilles horses in Homer, under naked nominations, without deserts and noble acts, which are the balsame of our memories, the Entelecchia and soul of our subsistences. To be namelesse in worthy deeds exceeds an infamous history. The Canaanitish woman lives more happily without a name, then Herodias with one. And who had not rather have been the good theef, then Pilate?<br/>But the iniquity of oblivion blindely scattereth her poppy, and deals with the memory of men without distinction to merit of perpetuity. Who can but pity the founder of the Pyramids? Herostratus lives that burnt the Temple of Diana, he is almost lost that built it; Time hath spared the Epitaph of Adrians horse, confounded that of himself. In vain we compute our felicities by the advantage of our good names, since bad have equall durations; and Thersites is like to live as long as Agamenon, [without the favour of the everlasting Register:] Who knows whether the best of men be known? or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot, then any that stand remembred in the known account of time? without the favour of the everlasting Register the first man had been as unknown as the last, and Methuselahs long life had been his only Chronicle."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"What Song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzling Questions are not beyond all conjecture. What time the persons of these Ossuaries entred the famous Nations of the dead, and slept with Princes and Counsellours, might admit a wide resolution. But who were the proprietaries of these bones, or what bodies these ashes made up, were a question above Antiquarism. Not to be resolved by man, nor easily perhaps by spirits, except we consult the Provinciall Guardians, or tutellary Observators. Had they made as good provision for their names, as they have done for their Reliques, they had not so grosly erred in the art of perpetuation. But to subsist in bones, and be but Pyramidally extant, is a fallacy in duration. Vain ashes, which in the oblivion of names, persons, times, and sexes, have found unto themselves, a fruitlesse continuation, and only arise unto late posterity, as Emblemes of mortall vanities; Antidotes against pride, vain-glory, and madding vices. Pagan vain-glories which thought the world might last for ever, had encouragement for ambition, and finding no Atropos unto the immortality of their Names, were never dampt with the necessity of oblivion. Even old ambitions had the advantage of ours, in the attempts of their vain-glories, who acting early, and before the probable Meridian of time, have by this time found great accomplishment of their designes, whereby the ancient Heroes have already out-lasted their Monuments, and Mechanicall preservations. But in this latter Scene of time we cannot expect such Mummies unto our memories, when ambition may fear the Prophecy of Elias, and Charles the fifth can never hope to live within two Methusela's of Hector."</blockquote>


  *[The Discovery of France: A Historical Geography from the Revolution to the First World War](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0393059731&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                        Graham Robb                      ★★★★★    2007   2013/10/24   <i>Discovery of France</i> charts the transition of the region covered by modern France into the unified cultural/political/geographic entity of today. This is incredibly interesting because from our perspective, we have forgotten (if we ever knew) what went into the process of taking the thousands of villages and regions differing in all sorts of ways, and crushing them into the relatively homogeneous high-tech culture of today - unifying languages, political systems, forms of transportation, religion, and so on. A theme throughout is Scott's legibility (<i>Seeing Like A State</i>); Robb gives all sorts of examples demonstrating local knowledge, specialized information, and resistance to outsiders.<br/><br/>Often people dramatically underestimate this. It's easy to assume that the vast nation-states like China or America just sort of came into existence naturally, but this overlooks the amount of effort Chinese/American governments/organizations have put into unification, in aspects ranging from stamping out as many languages and other cultures as possible to simplifying existing languages (particularly striking in China) to enforcing standardized units & measures (encouraging cash crops is a good way) to standardized national educational curriculum inculcating patriotism and common beliefs. You may not think that they are 'unified', but they are far more unified than they used to be - contrast the original 13 American colonies to how large America is now, or look at historical maps of Han China with the current boundaries, and think about all the cultural, linguistic, political, and economic differences that used to exist, and how many of, say, the languages are now extinct. (To say nothing of the peoples... Tibet and the American Indians come to mind as examples unique only for the documentation and notice taken of their particular instance.) The process of homogenization and simplification happens in many large countries, for easily-understood reasons such as the convenience of the state. Besides Robb & Scott, some views of this process can be found in Fukuyama's <i>The Origins of Political Order</i> for China. (You could also get a bit of the American process out of Howard Zinn's <i>A People's History of the United States</i> by looking at various incidents in the right way, but that's too polemical & focused on other topics for me to really recommend.)<br/><br/>This may sound like a very grand theme, but Robb is able to give so many fascinating examples that one forgets the underlying demonstration and just basks in the knowledge of how the past is a very foreign country. (As I mention in my review of <i>The Dark Enlightenment</i>, a sense of distance and alienation is one of the things I prize most in historical works - while there is continuity, continuity is easy to find and it is beyond easy to portray the past as proceeding Whiggishly and comprehensibly into the present, obscuring all the ways in which we are profoundly alien from the past.)<br/><br/>Where do I start... The extraordinary fact that until the 20th century, French was only a plurality language in France? The stiltwalking shepherds? The horrifying bits about drunken dying babies being carted to Paris by the 'angel-makers'? The packs of smuggler dogs who smuggled goods in and out of France for their human masters? (Or the dog-powered factories?) The forgotten persecution of the cagot caste? The Parisian who sold maggots to fisherman, which he raised in his closet on a pile of cat & dog roadkill collected from the streets? The wars between rival villages? The commuting peasants who thought nothing of a 50 mile walk? The strange twists of fate that lead regions to specialize in particular wares? The villages of cretins or families who regard a cretinous child as a gift from god? The mapping of the hidden communication networks that spread rumor at the speed of a horse? The corvée system of road-building, so inefficient at points that transporting the materials to build 1 more meter of a road could destroy more than 1 meter of that same road? All of this and much more is to be found in Robb's dizzying tour of France, past and present, a tour I found as entertaining as educational.<br/><br/>I made per-chapter excerpts of parts I liked:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/4JZVk5kuqSi">prologue, ch1</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/GSdU6qpDcM2">ch2</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/PPjdzksHnoa">ch3</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/GDs5GKdzAQf">ch4</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/eagqYu16LzX">ch5</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/UuSE6nU3MPD">ch6</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/6XS1cW7RBVU">ch7</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/TSPVL1uK3Jr">ch8</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/9aKBTjugpQy">Interlude</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/bjTPw8XrctV">ch9-10</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/coFPe4goefm">ch11-12</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/JbaWwWQmMRz">ch13</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/cpJ6KGPSsXt">ch14</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/cSt2hw5LE27">ch15</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/aJK6rDz31kx">ch16</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/heQcLMAMCNm">ch17 & epilogue</a></li><br/></ul>


  *[Stories of Your Life and Others](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0330426648&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Ted Chiang                       ★★★★★    2010   2012/12/12   What's there to say about Chiang that all the others don't say? He is the closest thing to a modern Jorge Luis Borges in melding high concepts with literature to create something better than either; in some respects, I'd rank his best short stories as better than Gene Wolfe's. His writing is deceptively excellent: I would call him a writer's writer, because the flat evenness of his prose may strike a reader as boring unless they have tried to write as clearly themselves and failed abysmally, at which point they begin to appreciate Chiang's infallible choice of words and lucid prose which sinks into the mind without friction.<br/><br/><i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i> is much superior to his novella <i>Life Cycle of Software Objects</i>, and contains pretty much all of his greatest short stories which I have read, except for his excellent <a href="http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html">"Exhalation"</a>. I read most of them online, so when I had the chance to read a hardcopy of the full collection, I seized it.<br/><br/>1. "The Tower of Babylon"; amusing, and in describing the lives of the people living on the tower, moving in some respects. The final ending feels like an appropriate conclusion. If one had to criticize it, it would be that the Tower itself is completely unrealistic even in the Biblical cosmology of the story: as I said, the best Chiang stories unite literature and good ideas. I would rank this \#5 of the 8 stories.<br/>2. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130112204225/http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/division/full/">"Division by Zero"</a>; not terribly impressive - over-wrought, and I feel I have read this story before and better. \#7.<br/>3. <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/under.htm">"Understand"</a>; a classic in the niche genre of superintelligence, and IMO better than Vinge's "Bookworm, Run!" and at least as good as <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>. Chiang, like every other author, confronts the limits of his writing ability in trying to write convincingly of a superintelligence who is by definition vastly smarter than he is (the same challenge laid down by Campbell to Vinge: "you can't write this story, and neither can anyone else"), and so the start of the story is much stronger than the later passages. But the whole is still memorable. \#4.<br/>4. <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~jstern/miscellanea/General/Chiang98.pdf">"Story of Your Life"</a>; I had actually read this one before, and dismissed it as sentimental tripe with some weak physics or linguistic layering that I didn't really understand. Fortunately, just a few weeks ago I happened to read some material on the Lagrangian interpretations of physics and combined with knowing in advance the ending, I was able to appreciate the story much better this time. I would rank this \#3 of the 8 stories. \#3.<br/>5. <a href="http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/evolution.html">"The Evolution of Human Science"</a>; short, dubious. Not Chiang's best work, on either dimension. \#8.<br/>6. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802144026/http://www.tor.com/72ltrs.html">"Seventy-Two Letters"</a>; simply fantastic. The setting is wonderful, the problem great, the ideas even better, and the solution & meaning better still. \#2.<br/>7. <a href="http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/hell.html">"Hell Is the Absence of God"</a>; as an atheist who keeps coming back to the Book of Job, this story came as a gut punch. The writing is Chiang at his most Chiang-y, the world interesting and provocative, and the ending simply unspeakable. But don't take my word for it, 'decide for yourself', as the fallen angels say. \#1.<br/>8. <a href="http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/liking.html">"Liking What You See: A Documentary"</a>; interesting ideas, but something about the dialogues and characters seem off. It just jars me. \#6.


  *[Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=159420182X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                 Liaquat Ahamed                   ★★★★★    2009   2012/09/16   I enjoyed this tremendously for revealing a new world to me where I thought I already knew the lay of the land. Throughout were revelations to me - just how ruinous WWI was, how reparations kept echoing and damaging Germany, how exactly the hyperinflation started (it was only partly the Versailles payments but more the social programs?), how America aggravated the issue (the Coolidge quote and the American tourists certainly never appeared in my history textbooks...), how late the stock bubble was and the details of the endless succession of crises that rocked Europe. It's also interesting to understand why Keynes had such a grip on economics until recently: he predicted repeatedly what would happen, and it's hard not to sympathize a great deal with him.<br/><br/>As far as criticism goes, I can agree with some of the other reviewers: Ahamed sometimes goes overboard with the narration, and skimps on the details one might want. He provides no convenient graphical network of how factors affect each other in a gold economy, so one is left constantly being surprised by connections, and the rare graph is not very helpful - for example, he provides a time graph of the big economies' rises and falls in growths, and remarks that their recoveries in the Great Depression... and nowhere on the graph marks for each country the year in which they left gold! Well, that graph wasn't very informative or helpful - Tufte would not be pleased.<br/><br/>Applying it to modern times is a little harder, although the ironies are many (particularly the Germans being hardasses on debt now, when they seemed to understand not all debts could be paid after WWI... -\_-). One thing that struck me was how the nationalist demonstrations & protests in Germany reminded me of what I hear in *China* these days - which has a somewhat similar per capita GDP as those nations and is in a similar period of industrial growth, and indeed, is the young turk of Germany to the old tired island-nation England of Japan, with South Korea as a nervous smaller neighbor (France?). And China is quite aggressive lately. Before WWI, it was rightly pointed out that such a war between such networked nations as France/Germany/England would lead to ruin; and right now, one could point out a similar thing with China/SK/Japan/USA. But nevertheless, before WWI, they thought they could have a short victorious war against an encircling enemy; does China think it can have a short victorious war against their encircling enemy, the USA-coordinate nations? I don't think it does, but I do think people underestimate the risk of war in East Asia. (Of course it could never happen; just like WWI could never happen.)


  *[The Notenki Memoirs: Studio Gainax & The Men Who Created Evangelion](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1413902340&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                               Yasuhiro Takeda                  ★★★★★    2005   2009/01/01   For people interested in the history of the anime industry, Takeda fills in many gaps related to Gainax - it's hard to think of any source which covers nearly so well <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#the-daicon-3-decision">DAICON III</a>, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#daicon-4">DAICON IV</a>, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#opening-the-general-products-store">General Products</a>, or throws in so many tidbits about surrounding people & Japanese SF fandom. It is an invaluable resource for any researcher, and I felt compelled to create <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs">an annotated e-book edition</a> in order to elucidate various points and be able to link its claims with versions of stories by other people (for example, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/1996-animerica-conscience-otaking">Okada's extensive <i>Animerica</i> interview</a>)<br/><br/>Those reading it solely for <i>Evangelion</i> material will probably be relatively disappointed: Takeda clearly finds NGE not very interesting, may have bad associations due to being targeted in <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#tax-evasion-and-the-birth-of-my-daughter">the tax raids</a>, and he was writing this in 2000 or so - too close to the events and still working at Gainax to really give a tell-all, and it's not a terribly long or dense book in the first place. Nevertheless, NGE fans will still find many revelations here, like the origin of NGE production in the <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#aoki-uru">failure of the *Aoki Uru* film project</a> (an origin simply not present in any Western sources before <i>Notenki Memoirs</i> was translated).<br/><br/>In general, Takeda is not interested in a 'tell-all'; perhaps it's due to fear, perhaps too many people involved are still alive and kicking, but he only covers the embarrassing things which are too well-known to omit, like the aforementioned tax raid or <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs#okada-leaves-the-company">Okada's ouster from Gainax</a>.<br/><br/>I read it several times, and that was how I wound up transcribing my copy into a webpage which I could annotate with cross-references and interviews with other figures like Okada or Anno - I realized I could keep rereading it, or just do the job right the first time. It's been a valuable resource for me ever since.


  *[The Remains of the Day](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0571225381&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Kazuo Ishiguro                   ★★★★★    2005   2012/07/21   Of Ishiguro's novels, this is the most elegant, most restrained, and most <i>English</i>. The prose is so smooth that like Gene Wolfe's, it becomes invisible, and you pass through it to the slow silent sorrow of the protagonist. Ishiguro makes the tragedy clear enough, shows us the heart of the story, but without ever being gauche.<br/><br/>In July 2012, I re-read it and for good measure, I watched the movie too. (The movie, IMO, was pretty good with excellent casting, if unfortunately often blunter than the novel and the ending especially so.)<br/><br/>What struck me this time through was the ending of the novel: the butler has come to realize that his life has been suboptimal and less joyful than it could have been because he shunned Miss Kenton and denied his emotions out of a misguided sense of professionalism. But instead of the typical Hollywood ending where he woos Miss Kenton or quits his job etc, he realizes that it really is too late: his and Miss Kenton's day is almost over, and the important thing to do is make the most of 'the remains of the day', which for him is returning to his butlering job but being less rigid and more human.<br/><br/>It is, in other words, a beautiful tale of not honoring sunk costs or pursuing lost opportunities.


  *[The Book of Lord Shang. a Classic of the Chinese School of Law.](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1616191872&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                   Shang Yang                       ★★★★★    2011   2008/01/01   *The Book of Lord Shang* was very hard for me to read: there is something sublime about it, in the old sense of "terrifying" - the policies and reasoning laid out are a systematic crushing of anything that might oppose the State and its goals. It feels inhuman, mechanical, and all the more so when you know that these sort of policies *were* how the Qin crushed all their opposition - including those states espousing the other Hundred Schools of Thought like Mohism & Confucianism - and that the 20th century affords further examples of how these policies proved themselves in practice (unlike the former Schools).<br/><br/>It's no wonder that there are so many negative reviews on the other copies here at Goodreads: you might as well ask your normal liberal Western to drink rat poison as read *The Book of Lord Shang* & try to fairly evaluate it. Even if they've read their share of Chinese classics & philosophy, they wouldn't *want* to understand it, just like modern readers don't *want* to understand the Unabomber's philosophy.<br/><br/>(The version I read was an <a href="http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/duyvendak_jjl/B25_book_of_lord_shang/duyvlord.rtf">ebook version of Duyvlord</a>.)


  *[The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0374227349&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                      Francis Fukuyama                 ★★★★★    2011   2012/01/01   It is, overall, an excellent book and one of the better ones on grand history I've read†... but Fukuyama does not have a very transparent prose style, and makes no concessions to those who don't have a good grasp on global history and especially those who don't know their Chinese history well (eg. if you can't put the Qing, Han, Qin, and Shang dynasty in order, you aren't going to enjoy at all the large amounts of material he rightfully devotes to Chinese politics). And it's seriously big, no kidding. This is no fluffy <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> walk through the park!<br/><br/>† for example, I found some sections very useful for structuring my thinking on the evolution of ethics and <a href="http://www.gwern.net/The%20Narrowing%20Circle#ancestors">regard for ancestors</a>.

Overall, far more interesting than I had expected. Surprisingly funny or interesting anecdotes. There is a superfusion of gods and oracles, which was curious - the oracles truly were treacherous! The Persian kings come off as remarkably capricious and destructive, even the good ones. And Herodotus has a strange capacity to skeptically reason well & sensibly and then be completely superstitious in the next passage. Having read about these ancient events many times, I found half the value was just seeing a thorough account from a single Greek's perspective.


  *[The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0670022950&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                        Steven Pinker                    ★★★★★    2011                This was really really good, as in, maybe the best book I've read that year. Time and again, I was shocked to find subjects treated of keen interest to me, or which read like Pinker had taken some of my essays but done them way better (on terrorism, on the expanding circle, etc.); even so, I was surprised to learn new things (resource problems don't correlate well with violence?).<br/><br/>I initially thought I might excerpt some parts of it for an essay or article, but as the quotes kept piling up, I realized that it was hopeless. Reading reviews or discussions of it is not enough; Pinker just covers too much and rebuts too many possible criticisms. It's very long, as a result, but absorbing.

It was surprisingly unliterary and unpostmodern for Mitchell, but in exchange, he nailed the historical details and gave us an adventure which subverted many of the usual tropes - the raid on the nunnery was just a trap, the hero doesn't get the girl, his chief heroism was standing there to be shot at, and the man who takes down the big baddie is someone we thought to be entirely in the baddie's pocket. The supernatural aspects are implied to be genuine, but it's never resolved, which I am grateful for. It would ruin the feel.

Tainter                ★★★★★    1990                Very good: much better than Jared Diamond's *Collapse*, and much more convincing than Spengler or Toynbee.<br/>It was also deeply disturbing - the Ik amazed me in chapter 1, and the statistics in chapter 4 were extremely dismal and tie in far too well to Cowen's *The Great Stagnation* and Murray's *Human Accomplishment*. There are a great many datapoints suggesting that diminishing marginal returns to modern tech/science began sometime in the late 1800s/early 1900s...

It's really impressive how Stapledon just casually scatters around handfuls of jewels that lesser authors might belabor singly throughout an entire book.

Lin et al 2014)</a> is a large (52 chapters by \~50 contributors, 643 pages, 9.8M PDF) anthology of essays/articles/reviews/lists touching on all sorts of topics by many famous names (Efron, Rubin, Gelman, Wasserman, Tibshirani, Laird, Cook) - some of whom I know solely from methods bearing their names! The typesetting is tasteful & of high quality, with so many equations & graphs my PDF viewer visibly lags when scrolling. I read about it on <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2014/05/04/honored-oldsters-write-statistics/">Andrew Gelman's blog</a> & thought it would be interesting to read a broad survey of what's going on in statistics.<br/><br/>The anthology ranges from bureaucracy to professional autobio to reviews of subfields to speculations & challenges about future developments to advice about publishing & research. (Probably it would have been better to turn this into 2 volumes: the readers interested in careers & advice have to the technical material, while readers interested in that may not survive the sections about COPSS & autobios.) Since statisticians get involved with any topic they please, the subject areas range from deer in Canada - & trying not to fall out of the helicopter - to traveling to the moon to breast cancer to polygraphs.<br/><br/>Given the heterogeneity, much of it was boring or over my head or both, but much was interesting & I learned about novel topics. In one chapter, a survey statistician reminiscences about how she stumbled into statistics accidentally & fighting sexism in her early career & another mentions that the methodological debates over the famous Kinsey studies of sexuality were her entree to biostatistics while a third was unfairly treated by a Coast Guard exam & learned statistics to prove the exam was bogus while yet a fourth picked math as his major because the signup line at the college was shorter & thereby wandered into the intersection of statistics & agriculture, & in another chapter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_P._Dempster">Arthur Dempster</a> is still gamely defending the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer_theory">Dempster-Shafer</a> paradigm of statistics after all these years, while in yet another chapter there is a discussion of issues in high-dimensional data I couldn't understand etc.<br/><br/>The introductory bits about the history of COPSS were boring, self-indulgent, & devoid of explanations why the organization functioned or what good it did or why outsiders valued it & what really went on inside it.<br/><br/>The autobiography section features people who can remember all the way back to the 1920s or so, a time when statistics was very different than it is now. Reading them a few at a time (they're generally easy reads), a number of interesting trends pop up. For example, people seem to get married extremely young, as grad students or undergrads, after short romances; it's impossible to mistake the computing revolution: before the 1960s or so, computers & techniques requiring a great deal of computation never come up, but then they become increasingly common (sometimes with shocking details: one person mentions that to test a cool new idea, using a simulation method, ate their department's entire computer budget for that month) & transformed approaches starting in the '80s, & Bickel mentions in his essay his "pleased surprise that some of my asymptotic theory based ideas, in particular, one-step estimates, really worked" when implemented on modern computers; a subtrend here is also that Bayesian methods seem to explode overnight then too & even frequentists begin borrowing Bayesian techniques & logic when useful (thankfully, Tukey's quip that "The collective noun for a group of statisticians is a quarrel" may no longer be true); WWII appears as a clear break-line in the earliest autobios, & to judge by the autobios (a selected sample to be sure!) academia used to be far less competitive & one could (in the great post-WWII expansion) almost fall into a tenured position. Some bios are humorous, like <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/KEwNh9qDxTuMQodN">Olkin's </a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald">Wald</a> had a classic European lecture style. He started at the upper left corner of the blackboard and finished at the lower right. The lectures were smooth and the delivery was a uniform distribution.<br/><br/>...The notion of an application in its current use did not exist. I don't recall the origin of the following quotation, but it is attributed to Wald: "Consider an application. Let <i>X<sub>1</sub>, . . . , X<sub>n</sub></i> be i.i.d. random variables."<br/><br/>...The Master's degree program required a thesis and mine was written with Wolfowitz. The topic was on a sequential procedure that Leon Herbach (he was ahead of me) had worked on. Wolfowitz had very brief office hours, so there usually was a queue to see him. When I did see him in his office he asked me to explain my question at the blackboard. While talking at the blackboard Wolfowitz was multi-tasking (even in 1947) by reading his mail and talking on the telephone. I often think of this as an operatic trio in which each singer is on a different wavelength. This had the desired effect in that I never went back.<br/><br/>...Many prominent statisticians attended the meeting, and I had a chance to meet some of them and young students interested in statistics, and to attend the courses. Wolfowitz taught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis">sequential analysis</a>, Cochran taught sampling, and R.A. Fisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_inference#Status_of_the_approach">taught something</a>.</blockquote><br/><br/>Or the history related is surprising, for example, the revelation that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_bound">Chernoff bound</a> was actually proven by <i>Rubin</i> (yes, he did that too) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Chernoff">Chernoff's</a> essay <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/eFSsA6zVVbRAkIBG">"A career in statistics"</a>, where he mentions a tragicomic incident in rocketry where a clever method for course-correction turned out to be unnecessary.While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_distance">Cook's distance</a> in looking for problems in linear models stems from one bizarre rat (<a href="https://pdf.yt/d/12JSQ_jdl0sopUBp">"Reflections on a statistical career and their implications"</a>):<br/><br/><blockquote>...I redid his calculations, looked at residual plots and performed a few other checks that were standard for the time. This confirmed his results, leading to the possibilities that either there was something wrong with the experiment, which he denied, or his prior expectations were off. All in all, this was not a happy outcome for either of us.<br/><br/>I subsequently decided to use a subset of the data for illustration in a regression course that I was teaching at the time. Astonishingly, the selected subset of the data produced results that clearly supported my colleague's prior expectation and were opposed to those from the full data. This caused some anxiety over the possibility that I had made an error somewhere, but after considerable additional analysis I discovered that the whole issue centered on one rat. If the rat was excluded, my colleague's prior expectations were sustained; if the rat was included his expectations were contradicted. The measurements on this discordant rat were accurate as far as anyone knew, so the ball was back in my now quite perplexed colleague's court.<br/><br/>The anxiety that I felt during my exploration of the rat data abated but did not disappear completely because of the possibility that similar situations had gone unnoticed in other regressions. There were no methods at the time that would have identified the impact of the one unusual rat; for example, it was not an outlier as judged by the standard techniques. I decided that I needed a systematic way of finding such influential observations if they were to occur in future regressions, and I subsequently developed a method that easily identified the irreconcilable rat. My colleagues at Minnesota encouraged me to submit my findings for publication (Cook, 1977), which quickly took on a life of their own, eventually becoming known as Cook's Distance.</blockquote><br/><br/>And naturally, someone will choose to go meta & criticize the implicit goal of the autobios & explicit goal of the career advice section - as one would hope of statisticians, he recognizes the epistemological peril of a series of highly-selected freeform anecdotes; Terry Speed in <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/ya5_qLUggk2RblmQ">"Never ask for or give advice, make mistakes, accept mediocrity, enthuse"</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>What's wrong with advice? For a start, people giving advice lie. That they do so with the best intentions doesn't alter this fact. This point has been summarized nicely by Radhika Nagpal (2013). I say trust the people who tell you "I have no idea what I'd do in a comparable situation. Perhaps toss a coin." Of course people don't say that, they tell you what they'd like to do or wish they had done in some comparable situation. You can hope for better. What do statisticians do when we have to choose between treatments A and B, where there is genuine uncertainty within the expert community about the preferred treatment? Do we look for a statistician over 40 and ask them which treatment we should choose? We don't, we recommend running a randomized experiment, ideally a double-blind one, and we hope to achieve a high adherence to the assigned treatment from our subjects. So, if you really don't know what to do, forget advice, just toss a coin, and do exactly what it tells you. But you are an experiment with <i>n</i> = 1, you protest. Precisely. What do you prefer with <i>n</i> = 1: an observational study or a randomized trial? (It's a pity the experiment can't be singly, much less doubly blinded.) You may wonder whether a randomized trial is justified in your circumstances. That's a very important point. Is it true that there is genuine uncertainty within the expert community (i.e., you) about the preferred course of action? If not, then choosing at random between your two options is not only unethical, it's stupid.</blockquote><br/><br/>Not all life incidents are amusing. In Gray's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/aNUuevKR6eKWsDSm">"Promoting equity"</a>, in between fighting the good fight, she proudly relates an incident I would be ashamed of, especially were I a statistician:<br/><br/><blockquote>Early in my career I received a notice from Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA), the retirement plan used at most private and many public universities including American University, listing what I could expect in retirement benefits from my contribution and those of the university in the form of x dollars per \$100,000 in my account at age 65. There were two columns, one headed "women" and a second, with amounts 15% higher, headed "men." When I contacted the company to point out that Title VII prohibited discrimination in fringe benefits as well as in salary, I was informed that the figures represented discrimination on the basis of "longevity," not on the basis of sex.<br/><br/>When I asked whether the insurer could guarantee that I would live longer than my male colleagues, I was told that I just didn't understand statistics. Learning that the US Department of Labor was suing another university that had the same pension plan, I offered to help the attorney in charge, the late Ruth Weyand, an icon in women's rights litigation...At first we concentrated on gathering data to demonstrate that the difference in longevity men and women was in large part due to voluntary lifestyle choices, most notably smoking and drinking. In a settlement conference with the TIAA attorneys, one remarked, "Well, maybe you understand statistics, but you don't understand the law."</blockquote><br/><br/>A statistician asking for guarantees! & why should voluntary lifestyle changes affect whether a predictable difference be compensated for? Pensions are job compensation, not a moral code handed down from on high, & if men do not live as long as women, 'equal' pay is never equal & defrauds them. Or, would Gray be against maternal leave, seeing as pregnancy is a "voluntary lifestyle choice"? & consider the sophistry: "in large part" - so would she have supported a differential which corresponded to the residual? If their analysis had showed up that black men drink & smoke even more than white men, would Gray be pleased to see a 'black penalty' applied to their pension payments? When is equal not equal? As always, one merely needs to ask: "who, whom?"<br/><br/>The autobiographical essays are interesting, but somewhat dry. I was pleased to reach the meat of the anthology: the freeform technical papers. Some of the chapters introduced me to ideas I had missed, such as the "bet on sparsity" argument (Cook, pg103), which reminds me of one folk argument for Occam's razor: you should assume the world is relatively simple & predictable & take actions based on that belief, because if the world is that way, then your actions will attain their ends & that is good, while if the world is inherently complex/unpredictable, then your actions will have no net effect which is neither good nor bad, so the former scenario <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">dominates</a> the latter. I paid close attention to Tibshirani's paper later in the volume, <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/tibs-copss.pdf">"In praise of sparsity and convexity"</a>.<br/><br/>Similarly, Dunson's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/U1Vu3s1UoKCkqGm6">"Nonparametric Bayes"</a> introduced me to an area I had little inkling of prior. The biostatistics papers (eg Breslow's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/Pf7UTl0xxSkRJbRB">"Lessons in biostatistics"</a> or Flournoy's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/lnOXhfGb5vqlCFft">"A vignette of discovery"</a>) bring up interesting challenges & biases to keep in mind when evaluating the latest clinical research (a skill useful for anyone), & leave me heartened at the life-saving practical work that field is doing. Nan M. Laird's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/86ltadQETuzs94fy">"Meta-analyses: Heterogeneity can be a good thing"</a> reminded me of the need, when doing my own meta-analyses, to not simply ignore high I<sup>2</sup>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_heterogeneity">heterogeneity</a> but think hard about what moderators I should include to try to explain some of it. Others raised interesting questions I've wondered about myself, for example, Xiao-Li Meng in <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/gnct5NViqafLnSeN">"A trio of inference problems"</a> asks how big a biased sample of a population has to be before it's of comparable quality to a random sample:<br/><br/><blockquote>Over the century, statisticians, social scientists, and others have amply demonstrated theoretically and empirically that (say) a 5% probabilistic/random sample is better than any 5% non-random samples in many measurable ways, e.g., bias, MSE, confidence coverage, predictive power, etc. However, we have not studied questions such as "Is an 80% non-random sample 'better' than a 5% random sample in measurable terms? 90%? 95%? 99%?" This question was raised during a fascinating presentation by Dr. Jeremy Wu...The synthetic data created for LED used more than 20 data sources in the LEHD (Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics) system. These sources vary from survey data such as a monthly survey of 60,000 households, which represent only .05% of US households, to administrative records such as unemployment insurance wage records, which cover more than 90% of the US workforce, to census data such as the quarterly census of earnings and wages, which includes about 98% of US jobs (Wu, 2012 and personal communication from Wu). The administrative records such as those in LEHD are not collected for the purpose of statistical inference, but rather because of legal requirements, business practice, political considerations, etc. They tend to cover a large percentage of the population, and therefore they must contain useful information for inference.</blockquote><br/><br/>which is what I've wondered while working on my <a href="http://www.gwern.net/hafu">census of biracial characters</a>, since my sample is biased <i>but</i> capture-recapture analysis indicates I've compiled up to 1/3 of the population, so how much does that compensate, does it drive the error from biases down to the same size as the sampling error? Meng derives an inequality:<br/><br/><blockquote>For example, even if <i>n<sub>s</sub> = 100</i>, we would need over 96% of the population if <i>ρ<sub>N</sub> = .5</i> [level of bias]. This reconfirms the power of probabilistic sampling and reminds us of the danger in blindly trusting that “Big Data” must give us better answers. On the other hand, if <i>ρ<sub>N</sub> = .1</i>, then we will need only 50% of the population to beat a SRS [simple random sample] with <i>n<sub>s</sub> = 100</i>...the same <i>ρ<sub>N</sub> = .1</i> also implies that a 96% subpopulation will beat a SRS as large as <i>n<sub>s</sub> = ... 2400</i>, which is no longer a practically irrelevant sample size.</blockquote><br/><br/>Berger's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/tYIElWdjXSMPTNrX">"Conditioning is the issue"</a> is a bit lost on me but interesting is one passage's discussion of turning notorious <i>p</i>-values into something more meaningful, error probabilities:<br/><br/><blockquote>The practical import of switching to conditional frequentist testing (or the equivalent objective Bayesian testing) is startling. For instance, <a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Sellke-Bayarri-Berger-calibration-of-P-2001.pdf">Sellke et al. (2001)</a> uses a nonparametric setting to develop the following very general lower bound on <i>α(s)</i>, for a given <i>p</i>-value...<i>p</i> = .05, which many erroneously think implies strong evidence against <i>H<sub>0</sub></i>, actually corresponds to a conditional frequentist error probability at least as large as .289, which is a rather large error probability. If scientists understood that a <i>p</i>-value of .05 corresponded to that large a potential error probability in rejection, the scientific world would be a quite different place.<br/><br/><pre>TABLE 23.1<br/>Values of the lower bound α(s) in (23.4) for various values of p.<br/>p .2 .1 .05 .01 .005 .001 .0001 .00001<br/>α(s) .465 .385 .289 .111 .067 .0184 .0025 .00031<br/></pre><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Other papers are a bit of a misfire: I hadn't heard of "symbolic data" before Lynne Billard's <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/iXMSQAywz0VGcNV_">"The past's future is now: What will the present's future bring?"</a>, & the paper still leaves me wondering what it really is.<br/><br/>Some I had already read - Gelman & Wasserman has <a href="http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/rise-of-the-machines/">already blogged about</a> their entries.<br/><br/>And still others make one wonder; in Rubin's interesting retrospective of his greatest-hits, <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/TNHE5WYzAteb5pwK">"Converting rejections into positive stimuli"</a>, he encourages the reader to not be discouraged by the journal submission process as it is so random & some of his best papers were rejected - which makes me wonder, 'so why have this whole journal rigmarole if rejection means so little...? would you use a statistical test which exhibited such poor calibration & discrimination?' & his remark that "if you are repeatedly told by some reviewers that everyone knows what you are saying, but without specific references, and other reviewers are saying what you are writing is completely wrong but without decent reasons, you are probably on to something" is true.<br/><br/>Overall, the anthology is interesting & worth reading (if not each and every paper).

Utter disregard for conventions and cliches of the genre. A hero who is an anti-Mary Sue. Endless inventiveness of the author.

But it got better, and began unfurling into a mad Victorian/fantasy cross, heavy on the social oppression & economic exploitation, reminiscent of China Miéville's bourgeois imperialist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Crobuzon">New Crobuzon</a>. The plot breaks down into a few discrete chunks of the protagonist Jane's life, which while highlighting the ruthless nature of life in a universe where the gods are real (the homecoming queen being sacrificed may be horrifying, but the consequences of not sacrificing are even more dire, as one memorable nihilist character makes clear; and our own society does not hesitate to sacrifice lives for its own ends, as with, say, coal-burning power plants) also highlight her cowardice and selfishness in betraying her friends instead of... what? We're not too clear, as the world begins melting and things get weird in an <i>Invisibles</i> or Dick-style turn towards radical ontological uncertainty. (The dragon, incidentally, appears in far less of the novel than one would expect from the title.)<br/><br/>This may sound tedious, but Swanwick really does throw all sorts of fascinating little twists in along the way that keep one reading: malls where time literally stops so you can shop to your heart's content; factories with 'time clocks' that age one if one doesn't clock out; live gargoyles, with all the food requirements flying stone entails; a man who shrinks in his wife's regard for being a coward until he's the size of a homunculus & is trapped in a jar begging for death; markets in entertaining slaves among the <i>eloi</i> upper-class elves; magical engineers who are castrated to ensure they do not damage the magics they work with; academics who assault the castles of the gods in the quest for knowledge, and get burned; universities with purges that are literally decimating... Still, it's a happy ending, I think. Swanwick puts it amusingly in <a href="http://www.michaelswanwick.com/revan/idda.html" title="The Elf Lord, the triune Goddess, and Jane's dilemma (Caution - Spoilers)">a page of explanations</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>I gave her T as a reward for making it through to the end of the novel he's the one worldly thing she wants - and, quite to my surprise, the Goddess threw in K as well. What happens next? Does Jane marry T and keep K as best friend? Does K steal T from her? Do they all fall into bed together? This one I really don't know because the real reward I gave Jane for making it to the end of the book was freedom. I ran across Carol Emshwiller just after she finished writing <i>Ledoyt</i> and she said she was in mourning, that all these people she had lived with for years were suddenly gone and it felt as if they'd all died. "Doesn't it feel that way to you, too, when you finish a novel?" she asked. I thought about it. "No," I decided. "It feels like all these characters who have suffered under my persecuting hand have been set free. I imagine them running joyfully in all directions, as hard and fast as they can, so that I can never catch them and put them in another book again."</blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway, going over some of the parts of it which amused me while I was reading... You know your fantasy is grim and imaginative when astrology is due to educational corruption:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Hello? I was sent here for remedial?" The pale man looked up. He nodded wanly. Unhastily, without emphasis, he picked up a book, opened it, paged forward a leaf, and then back one. "There are three stars in the heavens," he said, "moving about Jupiter, erratic sidereal bodies which establish a lesser zodiacal process for that wanderer in its mighty twelve-year progression about the sun."..."Excuse me," she said hesitantly, "but what effect do these minor planets have on our behavior and fortunes? I mean, you know, astrological influence?" He looked at her. "None.""None at all?" "No." "But if the planets affect our fortunes—" She stumbled to a stop at the dispassionately scornful look on the pale man's face, the slow way he shook his head. "Surely you'll agree that the planets order and control our destinies?" "They do not." "Not at all?" "No." "Then what does? Control our destinies, I mean." "The only external forces that have any influence on us are those we can see every day: the smile, the frown, the fist, the brick wall. What you call 'destiny' is merely a semantic fallacy, the attribution of purpose to blind causality. Insofar as any of us are compelled to resist the flow of random events, we are driven solely by internal drives and forces." Jane seized on this last. "Then what you're saying is that our fate lies within us, right?" He shook his head. "If so, it must be extremely small and impossibly distant. I would not suggest you put any reliance in such an insignificant entity."'...She waited, but he did not elaborate. "In introductory astrology they told us that each person has a tutelary star and that each star has its own mineral, color, and musical tone, and a plant as well that is a specific for the disease that is caused by that star's occultation." "All untrue. The stars do not concern themselves in the least with us. Our total extinction would mean nothing to them." "But why?" Jane cried. "If it's not true, why would they teach it to us?"A dry fingertip tapped the page not impatiently but pedagogically. "All courses require textbooks, charts, and teaching aids. By the time the information codified as astrology was discredited and became obsolete, it had a constituency. Certain...personages benefit from the supply contracts."</blockquote><br/><br/>Nihilist the plot may seem to be, but it's leavened with some sharp satire; for example, bureaucracy in the factory:<br/><br/><blockquote>At last, late in the day, the inspector general arrived. A wave of dread preceded the elf-lord through the plant. Not a kobold or korrigan, not a spunky, pillywiggin, nor lowliest dunter but knew the inspector general was coming. The air shivered in anticipation of his arrival. A glimmering light went just before him, causing all heads to turn, all work to stop, the instant before he turned a corner or entered a shop. He appeared in the doorway. Tall and majestic he was in an Italian suit and tufted silk tie. He wore a white hard hat. His face was square-jawed and handsome in a more than human way, and his hair and teeth were perfect. Two high-ranking Tylwyth Teg accompanied him, clipboards in hand, and a vulture-headed cost analyst from Accounting trailed in his wake.</blockquote><br/><br/>School:<br/><br/><blockquote>After Grunt had called attendance, he cleared his throat. "The Three B's," he said. "The Three B's are your guide to scholastic excellence. The Three B's are your gold key to the doorway of the future. Now—all together—what are they?" "Be-lieve," the class mumbled. "Be-have. Be Silent." "What was that last?" He cupped a hand to his ear. "Be Silent!" "I caaaaaan't heeeeear you." "BE SILENT!" "Good."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>It was only when she went to empty out her locker that Jane realized how overgrown it had become. Orchids and jungle vines filled most of the space within and a hummingbird fled into the corridor when she banged open the door.</blockquote><br/><br/>Consumerism:<br/><br/><blockquote>It was a scorcher outside, but the mall was kept so cool that Jane was sorry she hadn't brought a sweater. The place was jammed with fugitives from the heat. They were recreational rather than serious shoppers, most of them. Their hands were empty and their eyes were clear.</blockquote><br/><br/>College roommate strife:<br/><br/><blockquote>"The dissection manual?" Monkey asked airily. "I ate it." "You what?" "I ate it. Why else would I want it? I was hungry and I ate it." "But I need it for class.""Then you shouldn't have given it to me." Monkey's beady eyes glittered strangely, maliciously, in her round face. "Really, Jane, you can be so dim at times." With a sudden standing backflip she disappeared through the doorway. Jane's hands clenched. But really it was no more than she had learned to expect. Roommates were forever eating your books, having anxiety attacks, adopting rats and carnivorous slimes which they then expected you to feed, getting drunk and throwing up on your best dress, moving into the closet and refusing to come out for months on end, threatening suicide the night before Finals, leaving piles of rotting leaves in the middle of the floor, entertaining boyfriends in your bed because it was made and theirs not, evolving into large bloodsucking insects. Monkey was actually good of her kind. Well, she could always pick up a new manual.</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>Monkey snatched the pencil from her hand and snapped it in two. Jane closed her eyes and traced the sigil of Baphomet with her inner vision. When she was calm again, she slid open a drawer."All right." There was a pair of latex gloves within. "I wasn't going to do this." She pulled them on. "But you don't exactly give me much choice, do you?" Credit where credit is due, Monkey didn't back down. There was a touch of the trickster in her heritage, and the trickster gene was a dominant. She licked her lips nervously as Jane pretended to lift an invisible box from the drawer. "You don't scare me." "Good." Jane swung a hinged lid back and reached within. "It works best if you don't believe." She removed an equally imaginary scalpel and held it up between thumb and forefinger, admiringly turning it one way and the other. "What are you going to do with that?" Jane smiled. "This!" She slammed her fist into Monkey's stomach.</blockquote><br/><br/>Academia:<br/><br/><blockquote>"I have been going over your laboratory reports, Miss Alderberry." Dr. Nemesis put an arm through hers, and walked her toward the front. "They are, if I may confide in you, disappointing, most disappointing in a student of your potential." "I've been having trouble with the sophic—"..."You must surely realize why I am concerned for you." "Well..." Jane didn't really, but that double glare bored into her, waiting for an intelligent response. "I'm here on a merit scholarship, so I suppose—" "No!" Dr. Nemesis stamped her foot impatiently. As if in response the elevator door slid open. She steered Jane outside. They were on an office level now. The walls were decorated with large unframed oils of umbrellas and sides of beef. The runners on the hall floors smelled new. "I am not talking about mere money, but about your very survival! This is a Teind year, surely you must know that." Jane nodded, meaning no. "The department heads are even now assembling the list of those ten percent of the students who are... expendable. Your name, Miss Alderberry, is going to be on that list unless you straighten up and fly right." She glared at her: weakly, sternly.<br/><br/>..."What set me straight was one particular incident. My adviser, none other than the wizard Bongay himself mind you, had obtained grant money from the Horned Man Foundation to create a divinatory engine in the form of a brazen head. This was, you will understand, very early in the history of cybernetics. It was all done with vacuum tubes then...Then he saw how the head glowed and how the solder ran in little rivulets from the seams in its neck and with it the gold and silver of its circuitry. Then did the wizard Bongay himself scream, in such fury that I fled for fear of his wrath." She laughed. "He lost tenure over that incident, and his life as well. That happened near the end of the fiscal year, and the University had been relying on that grant money. Everybody involved with that fiasco was executed by order of the Bursar." "How did you survive?"<br/>"They needed somebody to write the final report."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>The University library opened its doors at midnight and closed at dawn. The rationale given for such extraordinary hours was that they discouraged dilettantes and idlers from wasting the library's facilities.</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>Even for the School of Grammarie, which was widely held to have pushed the concept of liberal arts to an extreme, Professor Tarapple was grotesque. A burnt and crisped cinder of a creature was he, blackened and small, his limbs charred sticks, his torso rendered, reduced, and carbonized. His mouth hung open and his step was slow and painful. He seemed a catalog of the infirmities of age. He felt for the microphone. His hand closed about it with a soft boom, then retreated. The charred sockets of his eyes rose toward the ceiling. Jane realized that he was blind....Professor Tarapple groped for a laser pointer, leaving sooty handprints on the lectern top. He directed the pointer toward the slide with motions as jerky and unconvincing as a rod puppet's. The red dot of light jiggled off to the side of the screen. "This is—" The head wobbled. "This is—is Spiral Castle itself." Nobody so much as breathed. "No one but I myself has ever delved so deep into the Goddess's mysteries. The Ocean above which it is suspended is Time itself, and so far as could be determined with our limited instrumentation extends to infinity in all directions. Next slide."...Jane was having a hard time following the lecture. The harsh white image of Spiral Castle was like a magnesium flare. It swelled and dwindled in her vision, as if softly breathing. Her eyes pulsed, aching when she tried to follow the logic of its involutions. She had to look away..."Toadswivers! Curly-mounted bobtail jades! Codheaded pigfuck bastards!" With a start, Jane came to herself. Throughout the auditorium, the audience members were rousing themselves. A Teggish professor directly before Jane's seat straightened with a lurch and a snort. A gnome to her left passed a hand over his mushroom-spotted pate. Professor Tarapple had abandoned his lecture in a rage. He was berating his audience. "Only one being—one! me!—has ever delved so far into the Goddess's secrets and returned to talk of them. By cannon-fire, holy water, and bells, listen to me! I risked more than life and sanity to bring you these photographs. I—I—I was once young and tall and handsome. I had friends who died in this expedition and will never be reborn. We were caught and punished and punished again. I alone escaped. Look at me! See the price that I paid! So many times I have tried to tell you! Why do you never listen?" He was weeping now. "Woe!" he cried. "Alas for those who seek after Truth, for such is the Goddess's most hoarded treasure. Ah, she is cruel and unfathomable, and bitter, bitter is her vengeance." The lights came gently up. The applause was thunderous.</blockquote><br/><br/>One of the parts towards the end which particularly reminded me of <i>The Invisibles</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote>"One time, passing through the Carolinas somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M., Jerry and I picked up a white Lotus with two blonds in it. We honked and waved. They gave us the finger and put the pedal to the metal. I did the same, of course, but even with dual carbs it was no contest. We had a muscle car but they had a sex machine. They made us eat their dust....Ten-fifteen miles down the road we saw the Lotus in a Roy Rogers lot. We pulled in for some take-out burgers. There they were. We struck up a conversation. When we left, Jerry-D went with the driver of the Lotus. Her friend went with me...Anyway, there I was, a blond in pink hot pants rubbing up against me. I had my foot to the floor, her tongue in my ear, and her hand down my pants. I pushed up her halter top and squeezed her breasts. The air shimmered with the immanence of revelation. Little Richard was singing 'Tutti-Frutti' on the radio and it somehow seemed significant that what I was hearing had been electromagnetically encoded, transmitted as modulated radiation, reconstructed by the radio as sound, and only reinterpreted as music somewhere within the dark reaches of my head. I felt then that the world was an illusion - and a rather shabby one at that, an image projected upon the thinnest of membranes, and that were I to push at it just right, I could step out of the world entirely. I unbuttoned her shorts. She wriggled a little to help. I slid my hand under her panties. I was thinking that everything was information when I found myself clutching an erect penis. I whipped my head around. The blond was grinning wildly into my face. My hand involuntarily tightened about her cock. Her hand tightened about mine. They might have been the same hand. We might have been one person twinned. The car was up to about 100 mph. I wasn't even looking where we were going. I didn't care.<br/>It was in that instant that I achieved enlightenment."</blockquote><br/><br/>And finally, the gargoyle passage.

  *[The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III: Multiple Universes, Mutual Assured Destruction, and the Meltdown of a Nuclear Family](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0199552274&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                         Peter  Byrne                     ★★★★     2010   2014/11/08   (\~140k words, 4h read) Before reading, my knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Everett_III">Hugh Everett</a> was limited to basically the following sketch: a young American male who post-WWII suggested taking the Schrodinger wave-equation literally, yielding the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">Many-Worlds Interpretation</a>, and attacked over it, left academia for Wall Street where he became rich with an optimization algorithm, and in his absence, MWI very gradually gained adherents until it is now a respectable point of view (albeit still counterintuitive), and died at some point; also, some rumor that his daughter shot herself at a casino after losing, in a literal quantum suicide. This turns out to be incorrect and very incomplete: it wasn't Wall Street but the Pentagon, he died quite young, MWI wasn't attacked so much as ignored after being sabotaged, his daughter did commit suicide but it was at home with sleeping pills & had nothing to do with quantum suicide, and he did much more than just MWI & one optimization algorithm.<br/><br/>Byrne starts in media res, with Everett rich and drunk and self-destructing, then jumps back to his parents to start his tale; whether because 'past is prologue' or because of the heritability of personality traits, we get a sense that pathology (substance abuse, emotional problems) ran in the family, and his father survived some scrapes with corruption to finish out a reasonably good life; Everett bade fair to do better as a prodigy, excelling university, and arriving at Princeton & IAS in its golden WWII moment - the war won, von Neumann still alive & at the height of its powers (inventing game theory, modern computers, and steering the Cold War), and academia rushing into its Faustian post-war bargain with the US government and embarking on decade of exponential bloating (which, unsustainable, halted in the '80s or so, and this cauldron of legions of mediocre researchers + government funds + publish-or-perish has contributed to the modern scientific context in which we are awash in bogus results and worthless papers). An exciting time, and a fertile environment. I was surprised to learn that Everett made contributions to game theory, which turns out to later be relevant to one of the main mysteries of MWI (where the subjective or Born probabilities come from), and only then turned to quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>Byrne also covers his future wife, Nancy. He tries to be sympathetic, but it's hard to like or find her interesting at all; her views are shallow and deeply conformist, she comes off as lacking real insight into herself despite all the navel-gazing, lies to herself and others, and to be a lump of flesh going nowhere fast. He wants to paint her as neglected and damaged by her relationship with Everett, and to paint Everett as a loathsome lecher who won't take no for an answer, but it doesn't succeed. I was left with a major question: why would Everett ever want to date her, much less marry her? (Dating her is the real question here since it's clear why he married her: because she got pregnant and refused to abort, and given the straitlaced Pentagon world, he was put between a rock and a hard place. Byrne quotes her as denying this tactic, but that's obvious bullshit, especially given the era.)<br/><br/>After a jump forward to Everett's optimization work, we go back to Princeton and the genesis of MWI: like Columbus and Einstein and some others before him, Everett asked a deceptively simple question - what if we just take it literally? As a nice Schrödinger quote points out, it's odd to accept that the world or objects act like a wave-function up until they are observed and then they collapse into normality but to refuse to accept that 'inside' the wave-function it will also all <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Egan%27s_law">add up to normality</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this <i>or</i> that ... happening - with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but <i>all</i> really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him just <i>impossible</i>. He thinks that if the laws of nature took <i>this</i> form for, let me say, a quarter of an hour, we should find our surroundings rapidly turning into a quagmire, or sort of a featureless jelly or plasma, all contours becoming blurred, we ourselves probably becoming jelly fish. It is strange that he should believe this. For I understand he grants that unobserved nature does behave this way - namely according to the wave equation. The aforesaid alternatives come into play only when we make an observation - which need, of course, not be a scientific observation. Still it would seem that, according to the quantum theorist, nature is prevented from rapid jellification only by our perceiving or observing it. And I wonder that he is not afraid, when he puts a ten-pound note into his drawer in the evening, he might find it dissolved in the morning, because he has not kept watching it."</blockquote><br/><br/>Pursuing his idea, Everett wrote his thesis, and here we run into the major theme of Byrne's book, one he establishes admirably well: with many quotes from letters and recordings and referee reports, we see Everett's thesis adviser, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler">Wheeler</a>, turn from a courageous physicist, well-regarded for his daring speculations, into a biased coward who bullies Everett into sabotaging & watering down his thesis so as to not give offense to his mentor Niels Bohr.<br/><br/>I'm a little familiar with Bohr's philosophy of science & quantum mechanics from a course I once took on the topic, and I found it entirely without merit (the most unimaginatively instrumentalist 'shut up and calculate' viewpoint was preferable to Bohr's 'complementarity', because at least one was not left with the illusion of knowledge), so to find an excellent case made that it sabotaged the initial presentation of MWI and responsible for a multi-decade drought in one of the best available interpretations... does not leave me with a good impression of Bohr, Wheeler, the power thesis advisors wield, or academic physics in general.<br/><br/>Certainly it is understandable that Everett would leave academia and enter the military-industrial complex where his work was interesting, valuable, valued, and well-remunerated. Everett dived straight into the heart of US nuclear politics, the intersection of nuclear physics with military strategy and game theory and computing and operations research: what levels of bombs would be developed (the Super? and even more exotic weapons?), what military services would get what delivery systems, what would be the effects of nuclear war, what was the best way to run the Cold War? (In the '50s, none of this was set in stone yet.) It's a fascinatingly complicated period, for an overview see:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998"><i>Turing's Cathedral</i></a>, Dyson</li> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/369882157?book_show_action=false">review</a>)<br/><li><a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance"><i>Radiance</i></a> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/370154318">review</a>)</li><br/><li><a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends">"Old Legends"</a></li><br/><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Audit-Consequences-Nuclear-Weapons/dp/0815777736"><i>Atomic Audit</i></a></li><br/><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Making-Atomic-Bomb-Anniversary/dp/1451677618"><i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i></a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Sun-Making-Hydrogen-Bomb/dp/0684824140"><i>Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb</i></a></li><br/><li><a href="http://www.e-ipi.net/isri/_media/publications:ag-09-01.pdf"><i>Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons</i></a></li><br/><li><a href="http://www.athenalab.com/Confessions_Sam_Cohen_2006_Third_Edition.pdf"><i>Shame: Confessionas of the Father of the Neutron Bomb</i></a>, Cohen (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/668566831?book_show_action=false">review</a>)</li><br/><li><a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/publications/PAFbook.pdf"><i>Project Air Force: 1956-1996</i></a></li><br/></ul><br/><br/>Byrne unfortunately is too unsympathetic to cover the period fairly, taking the Dr. Strangelove route: everyone was insane and evil. This biases his coverage badly since he's so opinionated; in discussing the Prisoner's Dilemma, for example, he implies it shows the irrationality of rationality and hence the intellectual bankruptcy of game theory and all related exercises - but this is a confusion of what he would like to be true with what is actually true, because the Prisoner's Dilemma shows up again and again in all sorts of guises in the real world, along with the tragedy of the commons, and you know what? People in real life often <i>do</i> defect unless additional mechanisms are in place (often being put in place as a reaction <i>to</i> all the defecting). One of his footnotes reveals this strikingly:<br/><br/><blockquote>In other words, rationality is a (sometimes) quantifiable quality. Most human beings would agree that it is not a rational act to cross the street in front of a speeding bus, or to poison the water supply in search of short term profit, or to depend on fossil fuels, etc. But people in power who do obviously irrational things are often compelled to rationalize these actions by falling back on agendized utility values and probability statements. Of course, if you start with an irrational premise, e.g. "nuclear war is a rational option," no amount of utilitarian quantification can, believably, turn it into its opposite. Context is everything.</blockquote><br/><br/>This is a tissue of nonsense which exposes clearly that Byrne does not deal with the real world, but with a world of ideals in which there are never any hard choices or necessity to make cost-benefit tradeoffs and all that matters is what sounds good. Accordingly, he presents a one-sided picture; a discussion of the Bohm hearings omits any mention of why the US government might be so paranoid and worried about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_spies#Spied_for_USSR">spies</a> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project">Venona decrypts</a> come to mind, as do the many high-ranking Soviet spies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dexter_White">Harry Dexter White</a>) and might target people involved with the Manhattan Project in particular; similarly, he uncritically cites Sakharov claiming the US was responsible for the arms races (which seems like an odd reading of Stalin's character and his fellow researchers, for that matter), and later overestimates of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter">nuclear winter</a>. This bias on the biographer's part makes one wonder to what extent Everett's results about fallout were accurate: it's not like he would tell us if the report was found to be fallacious or since debunked. Still, while irritating and depriving the reader of some key context, the WSEG section seems comprehensive as far as it comes to Everett up until he left the Pentagon to start his own consulting business, and that's what really matters.<br/><br/>The business section is similar, but much less political as they consulted on more civilian topics. What he did is hard to tell: we're held back by Byrne targeting the general audience - I would have liked to know more about the statistical techniques involved, rather than vague descriptions like "QUICK randomly sampled the vast range of probable outcomes to select the most probable results", which could mean a lot of things; I can sort of guess what his 'Bayesian machine' was (sounds like a Kalman filter implemented with MCMC), but I'm completely baffled by the section about '"attribute value" programming' or what sort of database it was. It also sounds like Everett began drinking himself to death at this point (but why? he doesn't come off as so deeply depressed about MWI being ignored that he'd be suicidal in the midst of all his financial success; given Byrne's predilection for psychologizing, it's odd that he seems to let this central mystery pass without much more comment than some speculation that Everett was just hedonistic), and the kids enter their troubled teens (but one would never grow out of it). Somewhat surprisingly, he didn't manage his finances very well, living extravagantly, making deeply questionable investments, and failing to diversify, all in contravention to established financial advice, flaws somewhat surprising in a statistically and economically inclined man. Eventually, he dies.<br/><br/>In the mean time, MWI was gradually being rediscovered and rehabilitated by the likes of Deutsch and novel approaches like a Bayesian justification of Born probabilities developed, leaving off at the present time in which MWI is a respectable position leading to interesting research and believed in by a good-sized minority of physicists; this is interesting, but already familiar to me. I will have to leave it to other readers to judge how good these parts of the book are.<br/><br/>Overall, indispensable to anyone interested in the man, and a good account of a productive yet wasted life.

Gergel                    ★★★★     1979   2014/11/02   (\~95k words, \<3h read) Insider memoir of a relatively American wheeler-dealer in the chemical industry finished March 1977, following him from high school dabbling in chemistry through to graduation & WWII university work to founding a small chemical synthesis company until he turned it over to a successor. Gossipy, detailed, a vivid look inside the industry. Long out of print, I read the <a href="http://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/gergel_isopropyl_bromide.pdf">online scan (2.3M)</a>.<br/><br/>Gergel seems to have an amazing memory for all the details of his short stature, secular Jewishness, school life, colorful incidents (such as maiming a friend with injudicious safety procedures applied to potassium), the girls he swooned over (usually blonde), and classwork; unfortunately, some of the gossip aside, his school years aren't <i>that</i> interesting since I have no idea what any of the chemistry he was studying was (the politics of draft deferment, official corruption, and the mindless patriotism of the day, are a bit interesting but he mostly hints at them). Things pick up markedly by pg60 or so when Gergel begins doing syntheses for pay, eventually escalating to his own business - and here a modern reader will start blinking and wondering whether Gergel is deliberately trying to make a deeply compelling case for the necessity of government regulation, expanded budgets for the EPA & FDA & DoJ, the Precautionary Principle, and (much) higher Superfund taxes, and whether his life might not be a proof of quantum immortality and a defeat for the forces of natural selection, so reckless and poisonous and dangerous are his concoctions and business dealings. So many of his co-workers and acquaintances die young of exotic ailments that I am shocked to read in discussions of <i>Excuse Me Sir, Would You Like to Buy a Kilo of Isopropyl Bromide?</i> that not only is Gergel still alive as of 2012, but <a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2012/02/22/max_gergels_second_odd_book.php">Derek Lowe</a> says he's even written a sequel memoir, <a href="http://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/the_ageless_gergel.pdf"><i>The Ageless Gergel</i></a>!<br/><br/><a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/05/27/max_gergels_memoirs.php" title="Max Gergel's Memoirs">Derek Lowe</a> reviews it thusly:<br/><br/><blockquote>I came across the book in Duke's chemistry library in 1984, a few years after its publication, and read it straight through with my hair gradually rising upwards. Book 2 is especially full of alarming chemical stories. I suspect that some of the anecdotes have been polished up a bit over the years, but as Samuel Johnson once said, a man is not under oath in such matters. But when Gergel says that he made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_iodide">methyl iodide</a> in an un-air-conditioned building in the summertime in South Carolina, and describes in vivid detail the symptoms of being poisoned by it, I believe every word. He must have added a pound to his weight in sheer methyl groups. By modern standards, another shocking feature of the book is the treatment of chemical waste. Readers will not be surprised to learn that several former Columbia Organic sites feature prominently in the EPA's Superfund cleanup list, but they certainly aren't alone from that era.</blockquote><br/><br/><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/reading_list/indices/book_856.html">John Walker</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>Throughout Max Gergel's long career he has been an unforgettable character for all who encountered him in the many roles he has played: student, bench chemist, instructor of aviation cadets, entrepreneur, supplier to the Manhattan Project, buyer and seller of obscure reagents to a global clientele, consultant to industry, travelling salesman peddling products ranging from exotic halocarbons to roach killer and toilet bowl cleaner, and evangelist persuading young people to pursue careers in chemistry. With family and friends (and no outside capital) he founded Columbia Organic Chemicals, a specialty chemical supplier specialising in halocarbons but, operating on a shoestring, willing to make almost anything a customer was ready to purchase (even Max drew the line, however, when the silver-tongued director of the Naval Research Laboratory tried to persuade him to make pentaborane). The narrative is as rambling and entertaining as one imagines sharing a couple (or a couple dozen) drinks with Max at an American Chemical Society meeting would have been. He jumps from family to friends to finances to business to professional colleagues to suppliers to customers to nuggets of wisdom for starting and building a business to eccentric characters he has met and worked with to his love life to the exotic and sometimes bone-chilling chemical syntheses he did in his company's rough and ready facilities. Many of Columbia's contracts involved production of moderate quantities (between a kilogram and several 55 gallon drums) of substances previously made only in test tube batches. This "medium scale chemistry"-situated between the laboratory bench and an industrial facility making tank car loads of the stuff-involves as much art (or, failing that, brute force and cunning) as it does science and engineering, and this leads to many of the adventures and misadventures chronicled here. For example, an exothermic reaction may be simple to manage when you're making a few grams of something-the liberated heat is simply conducted to the walls to the test tube and dissipated: at worst you may only need to add the reagent slowly, stir well, and/or place the reaction vessel in a water bath. But when DuPont placed an order for allene in gallon quantities, this posed a problem... All of this was in the days before the EPA, OSHA, and the rest of the suffocating blanket of soft despotism descended upon entrepreneurial ventures in the United States that actually did things and made stuff. In the 1940s and '50s, when Gergel was building his business in South Carolina, he was free to adopt the "whatever it takes" attitude which is the quintessential ingredient for success in start-ups and small business. The flexibility and ingenuity which allowed Gergel not only to compete with the titans of the chemical industry but become a valued supplier to them is precisely what is extinguished by intrusive regulation, which accounts for why sclerotic dinosaurs are so comfortable with it. On the other hand, Max's experience with methyl iodide illustrates why some of these regulations were imposed.</blockquote><br/><br/><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8532534">keenerd</a>:<br/><blockquote><br/><p>Some of the topics covered:</p><br/><ul><br/><li>How to acquire chemicals as a poor high school student.</li><br/><li>How to get the most out of college.</li><br/><li>Starting up a company, finding your first customers and expanding your markets.</li><br/><li>Being a supplier to the Manhattan Project.</li><br/><li>What chemical engineering was like before the EPA and OSHA.</li><br/><li>What went on to create a future Superfund site.</li><br/><li>The tricks and techniques of traveling salesmen in the '50s.</li><br/></ul><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I made <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/RGNtX6Ha5Ng">some excerpts</a> conveying some of the key points.


  *[Chronicle of a Death Foretold](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=140003471X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez          ★★★★     2003   2014/08/26   A quasi-police description of the events leading up to, then long preceding, an honor-killing of one Santiago. The style strikes me as vastly simpler and less magically-realistic than <i>The Autumn of the Patriarch</i>, and much shorter. An inversion of detective mysteries: it is agreed by all who the proximate killer is, and the mystery centers on the how & whydunnit. (Borges would approve.)<br/><br/>As the witnesses and reports pile up, it seems to become clear that it's all a farcical assemblage of bad luck, buck-passing, murderous traditional cultures of machismo, and accident, but doubt is cast from the beginning - the murder happened on a beautiful clear day, which in the village's memory has become a dark rainy day; witnesses crowd around the magistrate eager to tell their involvement and exaggerate their part ("...the crowd that was pouring in to testify without having been summoned, everyone eager to show off his own important role in the drama..."); and the basis for the murder itself was likely a lie. This uncertainty renders the story sinister by the end - did the village conspire to kill Santiago? Did he anger everyone in a way we are not told of, because to provide a motive would confirm their guilt, and they collectively fail to help him, explaining the repeated slurs like '"He thought that his money made him untouchable," he told me. Fausta Lopez, his wife, commented: "Just like all Turks."'? (A nice example of cunctation: the mayor stop in to check on a dominos match so and is too late to take away the murder-weapons.) How much is Angela responsible for failing to respect the charade of virginity and deliberately sabotaging her marriage? (She is ultimately punished by the deliciously cruel method of returning 20 years of love-letters, unopened.) The assembled villagers in the square shout advice at the last second, but somehow, their exhortations serve only to confuse him and maneuver him towards his killers; the killers are made to remark their knives are rather clean given they're killing someone. And so on.<br/><br/>The more we read, the less we feel we know and the more worried we become that we're being fed a pack of distortions and warped memories in which the events were far more dramatic and complicated than they actually were. The magistrate warns us that "Give [someone] a prejudice and [they] will move the world", and the narrator remarks of one post hoc explanation that "It seemed to be such an easy truth that the investigator wrote it down...", and "fatality makes us invisible" - or is it <i>plot necessity</i> that makes the victim invisible? The villagers know their stories must terminate in the death of the victim, and in the stories they confabulate, he must be invisible to have performed the actions ascribed to him. (<i>Umineko no Naku Koro ni</i>'s vocabulary is useful here: outside the cat box, it is known that Santiago was killed by two knife-wielding twins at such a time and place; but everything else before that is part of the cat box and can be endlessly revised.) But each story, however plausible in the singular, has a hard time surviving conjunction with all the other tales being peddled ("he never thought it legitimate that life should make use of so many coincidences forbidden literature"). And their story can always be continued by imagining or forcing consequences:<br/><br/><blockquote>For years we couldn't talk about anything else. Our daily conduct, dominated then by so many linear habits, had suddenly begun to spin around a single common anxiety. The cocks of dawn would catch us trying to give order to the chain of many chance events that had made absurdity possible, and it was obvious that we weren't doing it from an urge to clear up mysteries but because none of us could go on living without an exact knowledge of the place and the mission assigned to us by fate....Hortensia Baute, whose only participation was having seen two bloody knives that weren't bloody yet, felt so affected by the hallucination that she fell into a penitential crisis, and one day, unable to stand it any longer, she ran out naked into the street. Flora Miguel, Santiago Nasar's fiancee, ran away out of spite with a lieutenant of the border patrol, who prostituted her among the rubber workers on the Vichada. Aura Villeros, the midwife who had helped bring three generations into the world, suffered a spasm of the bladder when she heard the news and to the day of her death had to use a catheter in order to urinate. Don Rogelio de la Flor, Clotilde Armenta's good husband, who was a marvel of vitality at the age of eighty-six, got up for the last time to see how they had hewn Santiago Nasar to bits against the locked door of his own house, and he didn't survive the shock. Plácida Linero had locked that door at the last moment, but with the passage of time she freed herself from blame. "I locked it because Divina Flor had sworn to me that she'd seen my son come in," she told me, "and it wasn't true." On the other hand, she never forgave herself for having mixed up the magnificent augury of trees with the unlucky one of birds, and she succumbed to the pernicious habit of her time of chewing pepper cress seeds.</blockquote><br/><br/>I am reminded of an old story:<br/><br/><blockquote>One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row, if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. "Nice biscuit, don't you think," said Korzybski, while he took a 2<sup>nd</sup> one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words "Dog Cookies." The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. "You see," Korzybski remarked, "I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter."</blockquote><br/><br/>People do not live in facts, they live in stories; and as long as the story continues, they are satisfied.<br/><br/>Everything has been brought to light, it seems, but nothing has been enlightened. By the end, the death has been foretold but remains unknown.


  *[Existence](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0765303612&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         David Brin                       ★★★★     2012   2012/12/01   *Existence* is best-seen as a rewrite of *Earth*, and *Earth* was a sprawling futurological serious novel which was trying to both world-build by including countless perspectives and quotes and discussions and terms but also put them into context to build a overarching thesis. Similar to Tad William's *Otherland* (the fantastic first book *City of Golden Shadow*, not the horrible sequels), Dos Passos's *USA*, or particularly Brunner's *Stand On Zanzibar* (to which Brin alludes, actually, in having a alien say "what an imagination I've got.")<br/><br/>The overriding theme is, of course, the Great Silence. Brin's solution, characteristically for a guy who wants to be the ultimate moderate and more moderate than thou, is to take up every solution: the Great Silence is due to more efficient physical transportation *and* memetic viruses *and* Berserkers *and* Lurkers *and* panspermia *and* ecological collapse *and* nuclear war *and*... This is a little impressive to behold, and overall, I did enjoy reading the book. Brin has had a few new ideas since *Earth* like the smart-mob.<br/><br/>But for the bad:<br/><br/>This jumping makes the book something like a huge primer on the Great Silence/Fermi's Question, yes, but *also* for something of a mess of a book. The book is huge, but a good deal of the bulk is fat and self-indulgent:<br/><br/>1. the dolphin sub-plot is rehashed Uplift material, which only very charitably has any relevance to anything else in the book (I thought that we would at least see them towards the end on spaceships as a token nod toward justifying the time spent on them, but no!)<br/>2. More germane subplots feel incomplete; the autistic kids, "cobblies" and the "Basque Chimera" form one such oddly underjustified subplot - is this a thing, now, lauding crippled autistic kids as secret savant heroes? I don't know which narrative is more denigrating of the human suffering involved, the standard one or this one. (Autism spectrum may be useful in some areas, but only a *little* is necessary and even the high-functioning often fail: I read in the *New York Times* the other day that that famous tech firm which uses autistic workers has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/the-autism-advantage.html?hpw&_r=0&pagewanted=all">5/6 rejection rate of applicants</a> just from the start. One must sift a lot of sand.)<br/>3. much material is borrowed from his previous nonfiction or fiction; allusions to *The Postman* are well and good, but when I could predict the resolution of the Senator Strong mystery from the instant we were told it was an addiction... This also means that I can track how many authorial mouthpieces there are in the novel, and it's pretty much *all of them*. Even people you think are wrong like Hamish are just acting as conduits for Brin's own beliefs. This leads to the severe problem, in a repeated first contact novel, that none of the aliens were remotely alien, and the humans all seemed pretty similar to each other too. It made me wish for Stanislaw Lem, or at least Watts's *Blindsight*.<br/><br/>Brin also has a very weird attitude towards what he calls extropianism but most people these days just call transhumanism. For example, the bogus anti-caloric restriction argument Hamish gives; it is bogus because (a) none of those monks or monasteries are following nutritionally balanced diets, indeed, usually for religious reasons they're following highly unbalanced diets if they're not like the Taoists possibly actively poisoning themselves with mercury, and (b) the records do claim countless instances of extreme longevity, which of course we don't believe because record-keeping was terrible - which means the evidence is so worthless and biased and corrupt that we can't use it to claim the opposite either! I've told Brin this like twice before, not that he cared. But by the time the story is set, the caloric restriction question will be settled: the primate studies will be finished, the human CRers will be dead, and the underlying biochemistry (or lack thereof) will have been elucidated. Suppose he's wrong? He probably doesn't care, he's dead-set against it anyway! I was a little awe-struck when he has his mouthpiece badmouth cryonics, *after saying it worked and there had been revivals*? WTF?<br/><br/>WTF indeed. This attitude could be called schizophrenic. Throughout the novel, Brin seems to struggle with the fundamental problem posed by Vinge: how does he keep the story human given his belief in progress and his basic acceptance of the Strong AI thesis? He never comes up with a good answers, but blatantly hand-waves them away: an emulated rat brain goes critical and escapes into the Internet? Well, uh - nothing happens because I say so (wow, ain't it strange)! There are even more AIs pervading the world, controlling countless key functions? Well, uh - nothing happens because I insinuate something about parents and children and them being grateful! (wow, ain't it strange - ever see a grateful river, spider, tow-truck, computer...? Humans can barely be grateful, ever.) Humanity is a few decades away from a general nanofactory assembler in his story and thousands of crystal probes come to visit? Well, uh - the crystal probes are completely inactive and don't carry nanofactories or *anything* despite it being a mindbogglingly great & evolutionarily fit idea and perfectly doable for them, because I say so and it lets me write adventure arcs with primates fighting over & chucking around glowing rocks! (wow, ain't it strange) He'll mock the extropians in the first part for believing in cryonics or uploads or AIs even though their most-criticized belief, cryonics, has been vindicated 100% in his story even beyond their hopes, their expectations of uploads are equally justified by events towards the end - non-destructive uploading, even! We'd settle for destructive uploads at this point... and so on and so forth. Well, uh - they're right but they're wrong, don't you see! (wow, ain't it strange)


  *[Singularity Rising: Surviving and Thriving in a Smarter, Richer, and More Dangerous World](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1936661659&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                         James D. Miller                  ★★★★     2012   2013/04/25   You could see Miller's *Singularity Rising* as an attempt to swim against the book current of Ray Kurzweil and present some of the *other* visions of the Singularity: specifically, the <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/schools">Intelligence Explosion school</a> as exemplified by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Robin Hanson. It then mixes in a bunch of material on intelligence & genetics, so we might identify an additional subschool: that of Steve Hsu on embryo selection for increasing human intelligence.<br/><br/>Miller succeeds in giving a wide overview of quite a few topics, from Hanson's <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">'crack of a future dawn' em scenario</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter">Great</a> <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html">Filter</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">comparative advantage</a> & the advantages of trade as it applies (and doesn't apply) to AIs to the intelligence orthogonality thesis (that <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis">intelligence does not imply benevolence</a>) to the logic of arms race and its particularly unpleasant applicability to AI development. And then he tosses in the mentioned intelligence & genetics material, which I was a little surprised to learn from - I had read many of his citations (and actually host a few of the online copies of the papers on my personal site, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/">gwern.net</a>), but he still threw in some ones that were new to me.<br/><br/>On a purely factual basis, I have relatively little to fault Miller for. He makes a risible claim about 1700s French life expectancies not hitting the 50s (true only if you include infant mortality, otherwise hitting 50s was perfectly routine - even in the worst tabulations, generally if you made it to 20 on average you would reach the 50s; see <a href="http://www.hyw.com/Books/History/Fertilit.htm">0</a>, <a href="http://lefleurdelystoo.blogspot.com/2008/01/life-expectancy-in-middle-ages.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/papers/GurvenKaplan2007pdr.pdf">2</a>, <a href="http://www.sarahwoodbury.com/life-expectancy-in-the-middle-ages/">3</a>, <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/07/the-great-escape.html">4</a>) but he is far from the first to make that mistake; he brings up dual n-back more than once, but he avoids making too many or overreaching claims on behalf of dual n-back such as the increasingly questionable effect on intelligence (see <a href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis">my meta-analysis</a>); he seems to criticize people for not taking seriously the method of castration for life extension but doesn't mention the issues with the data and the likelihood that the method would not work post-puberty (ie. for everyone who is able to morally consent to such a procedure). Otherwise...<br/><br/>Otherwise Miller's sins are simply that the writing is merely OK and while he does a reasonable job of, as Hanson puts it in <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/millers-singularity-rising.html">his own review</a> of *Singularity Rising*, "explaining common positions and intuitions behind common arguments", he barely defends them or clearly justifies them. While I and many others involved in the area dislike Ray Kurzweil's theories and arguments and books as being superficial, right for the wrong reason, overly optimistic etc, they do at least do their job of convincing people (and then hopefully they can adopt more nuanced or different views); but though I agree with a large fraction of it, it's hard to believe that anyone could read Miller's book and come out genuinely convinced of pretty much anything in it (as opposed to reactions like "that's interesting" or "maybe"). For example, he does a nice question-answer sequence against the kneejerk bad-philosophy reactions to cryonics, but one could easily bite all the bullets and simply question the incredibly sketchy case he makes (yes, it's great that wood frogs do cryonics all the time, but we're not frogs). He asks that anyone who signs up for cryonics email him about what convinced them - I immediately thought, "50% odds that no one has done so yet". (After writing this review, I asked Miller about this and he said no one had yet.)<br/><br/>And aside from as comprehensive a layman discussion of the issues involved in AI economics and technological unemployment as I've ever seen, I can't really name any original contribution this book makes.<br/><br/>I can't say I'm really glad I read it, but then I can't say I really regret reading it (I got a number of IQ-related citations, a discussion of neo-Luddism, and info on the more esoteric possibilities of embryo selection). This is because I already know almost everything in the book and have read many of the citations already, so I am not the target audience; it's good if you want an overview of non-Kurzweilian Singularity ideas and you don't want to read through scores of webpages and papers, and more or less unique in conveying them all in a compact single place - so in acknowledgment of this, I bump my rating up to 4 stars (though for me it was more like 3).<br/><br/>Excerpts:<br/><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/fu11KpSEyyS">intro-ch3</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/QhTNetHGYiA">ch4-5</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Y85Mnxab51i">ch9</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/XmcubNqP6Nh">ch10-12</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/1tB6Vt1ERMz">ch13</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/eRUSF1W1wUq">ch14-15</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/QyLRENKEHft">ch16</a>

I was really excited when the book was announced, since I hoped for expanded better version of his incredibly interesting paper/monograph <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf">"Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity"</a> (abstract: "...In particular, I argue that computational complexity theory - the field that studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve computational problems - leads to new perspectives on the nature of mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of logical omniscience, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction#David_Hume">Hume's problem of induction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_and_bleen">Goodman's grue riddle</a>, the foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve">closed timelike curves</a>, and several other topics of philosophical interest. I end by discussing aspects of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis."), and see also his more recent <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1438">"The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine"</a>.<br/><br/>The book turns out to be excellent, but not the 5-star universally-compelling, suitable for the layman & professional alike, complete coverage of all that is interesting about computational complexity and quantum I was hoping for. I'd say probably that one could get 80% of the value from reading "Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity", and even more if one is not particularly interested in computational complexity or quantum computing for their own sakes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- best book I've ever read on computational complexity<br/>- repeatedly throws out fascinating observations<br/>- learned a lot of new things even after years reading Aaronson's blog - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning">PAC learning</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum%27s_speedup_theorem">Blum's speedup theorem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_field#Model_Theory:_decidability_and_quantifier_elimination">Tarski's decision algorithm</a><br/>- humor better than expected<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- some key arguments are sketched out briefly or badly (eg. I don't know how anyone would understand Aaronson's version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Cantor's diagonal proof</a>, compared to longer better-illustrated versions like Hofstadter's in *Gödel, Escher, Bach*)<br/>- the complex-probability version of quantum mechanics didn't seem much more transparent to me than other versions; maybe if I had a physics degree? (Not that I really understood the 'Quantish' universe in Drescher's equally excellent book *Good and Real*, either.)<br/>- overuse of complexity zoo abbreviations<br/>- no discernible connection to Democritus or the Democritus quote<br/>- some later chapters highly technical and specialized and uninteresting (eg. the size of quantum states), not always meaningfully connected<br/>- Aaronson randomly inserts bizarre and sloppy anti-Bayesian digs - like at the end of his chapter on anthropics, he seems to think it refutes the 'religion' of Bayesianism. Dude, WTF? No one understands or agrees on anyone in anthropics, *that's the whole point of half the field*, and you want to use anthropics as an argument against Bayesianism‽ You want to disprove the eminently successful and practical by the useless and bizarre?

He is good enough to make a number of specific predictions... pretty much all of which are wrong.<br/><br/>For example, he predicts that post-WWII that the military would expand massively and form a real faction as opposed to a little 'puddle' (right) and that officers would enter the governing elites and change the composition of the ruling classes (wrong; Eisenhower was elected president, but there is no visible change in composition - few presidents or candidates have benefited from service, and contenders like Colin Powell or Wesley Clark have either not run or sunk like a stone. Congress remains a province of lawyers, and no one gets wealthy in the military until they take the revolving door), and further that his loosely defined Bonapartism is inevitable although I do not recognize Clinton, Bush, or Obama as being very Bonaparte-like figures.<br/><br/>On pg259-260, he presents a doozy of "scientific statements about social matters":<br/><br/><blockquote>...Thus we now may know, with considerably probability, that: if the state absorbs under centralized control all major social forces, then political liberty will disappear; if, after this war, Europe is again divided into a considerable number of independent sovereign states, then a new war will begin in Europe within a comparatively short time; if the present plan of military strategy (i.e., submarine attrition warfare, and "island-hopping") continues unchanged in the East, then Japan will not be definitely crushed for many, many years, and perhaps never; if the present Administration plans to remain in office after 1944, then it will have to curtail political liberty further; and so on.</blockquote><br/><br/>These statements were published in 1943, well *after* such events as the Battle of Midway (June 1942).<br/><br/>About the best I can say is that charitably, the counterfactual precondition for one may not have been true (if we assume 'Administration' refers to FDR, and not his Vice President, Truman, who succeeded FDR on his premature death and then was re-elected with no visible brownshirts stuffing pollboxes). The rest are simply embarrassing. The science of politics must indeed have been young... (Or perhaps there's some other common thread to the political criticism that opens and closes the book. Always a problem with authors discussing deception.)


  *[The Black Company (The Chronicle of the Black Company, \#1)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0812521390&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                       Glen Cook                        ★★★★     1992   2013/06/08   I read the trilogy in basically one sitting after reading the interesting opening to *The Black Company* on Tor.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first book a great deal: it's in a fairly stock medieval setting, but it handles the dark fantasy well and the plot quickly curdles into something more complex than expected as we gain entree via Croaker to the plotting of the Taken and the Lady, clever gambits & strategies, all ending in the resolution of all plots, defeat of the Dominator, and incidentally, the discrediting of the stock fantasy trope of a Joan-of-Arc-style messiah who will lead their forces to victory over the evil oppressor. It's also interesting wondering what Croaker is concealing from us, what his sins are: he tells us, the readers of his Annals, that he has concealed a great deal and softened other parts.<br/><br/>The downsides are few since it's a quick read: we see entirely too much of the Company's wizards (how many times do we need to be told that Silent is silent? or that One-Eye has just one eye? or that Goblin gets the better of One-Eye?), and it doesn't do a good job putting any real doubt into our minds about whether the Lady is the least of evils in the North, since she countenances quite a bit and the rebels' sins seem like the usual sort of thing which happens in war and then the wild dogs are put down during peacetime.<br/><br/>Book 2, *Shadows Linger*, was in some respects even better than *The Black Company*. While almost all the Taken are gone and so the scope for plotting has diminished considerably, instead we get a cozy intense little drama set in Juniper, of plotting & murder & corruption with the black castle in the background rewarding & driving it all with its tempting silver as it works towards its own little doomsday (you might call it a collective action problem!). Shed's plot thread is considerably more compelling than Croaker's this time, as we watch him give in to weakness, folly, and bad luck time and again, each time helping the castle grow a little closer to completion and finally triggering an epic battle destroying the entire town and shattering the Black Company. (The focus on the locals also has the benefit of not over-exposing the Company wizards and letting us see them from an 'outsider' perspective to restore their sheen of interest.) While admittedly the black castle is more than a little contrived (the Dominator foresaw his defeat and this was the only countermeasure? the castle took 700 years to mature? he didn't foresee the Juniper death cult before entrusting his last best hope of resurrection to it?), the plot overall still works well, and the creatures of the castle start to give an impression of why allying with the Lady might be a good idea.<br/><br/>Book 3, *The White Rose*, sees it all fall apart. We're plopped on the Plain of Fear at the heart of the renewed rebellion, which is OK enough, and we start learning what happened with Bomanz to release the Lady & the Ten which is even better. But the rebellion is a tawdry little affair, and the plot unengaging. Raven's foolishness is difficult to credit. The White Rose's power is almost too powerful. Parts don't seem to hang together (how do Tracker & Toadkiller Dog arrive *with* Raven's letter if they are only released by his interference?). The final alliance is too easily accomplished. The new Taken are only names. The finale is a succession of deus ex machinas - Father Tree's offspring on top of the silver spike on top of the true effect of naming (if all it takes to destroy someone's powers is to name them, why did this never happen before, and why were we told that true names merely allowed penetrating a magician's spells and defenses?) On top of that, the finale is almost anti-climactic: they dismantle the defenses and neutralize the Dominator using the Rose, and bury him more thoroughly. Oh. Well, OK... The book isn't so much bad, as disappointing since it features none of the intricacy of the previous books, is almost oddly streamlined and 'easy', and takes some easy way outs. I had come to expect more from Cook.


  *[Tombstone: The Untold Story of Mao's Great Famine](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=184614518X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yang Jisheng                     ★★★★     2012   2013/08/08   The statistics and anecdotes are fairly horrifying, and the sheer profusion drills in how widespread the famine was. But for me, the most fascinating part of <i>Tombstone</i> was how the vast Chinese government hierarchy rippled policies and misinformation up and down it - how the local cadres tried to bow to the demands they were hearing from higher up, how the higher ups took the falsified statistics and claims often at face value, and how the highest officials in Beijing seem almost childishly helpless as they stagger between skepticism of reports given them and unthinking acceptance of positive results. Mao particularly comes to mind in his constant swerving between "left deviationism" and "right deviationism" as he tries to get communal kitchens to work and takes at face value the harvest figures and "sputniks" (even as in other incidents, he scoffs at a local official, telling him flat out that such yields were simply impossible), as he is flattered by under-officials; despite his information problems, he astonishingly repeatedly engages in tactics of announcing liberal discussion and then brutally punishing anyone who was foolish enough to do aught but flatter Mao and his policies. Indeed, as Jisheng says, officials were placed into a situation of 'slaves to those above, tyrants to those below' (or however his phrase went).<br/><br/>With such perverse incentives, it's no surprise that we run into such perfectly Hayekian examples as 'deep plowing' or 'sputniks' or 'close planting' or the failure of communes to realize any gains of scale (and did realize diseconomies, like the example of how communes needed lumber to fire their large ovens/stoves rather than the little bits of grass individual households could use).<br/><br/>What is surprising is how effective the Chinese government was in maintaining control despite these severe systemic problems. How could so many millions starve to death, and no province rise up in rebellion? How could the revolts be so small scale, when the abuses were so bad and the death tolls large fractions of entire local populations? How did emigration not overwhelm any checks set up? It's easy to agree that Sen is basically right: Mao's famine could not have happened in any country with remotely democratic institutions like India, because the pressure would simply have overwhelmed any coercion the feeble government could orchestrate. But there's also a flip side here: Mao remarks with surprise 'how good' the Chinese people were, that he could summon millions and disperse them with a wave of his hand, and another high official says similarly that it is only the goodness of the people which prevented the Army from being called in. Jisheng is at pains to show that the Communist propaganda worked and the people were not uniformly cynical about the regime like the Russians at the end of the USSR were: many officials sacrificed their careers or lives for their people, high officials are routinely shocked when they return to their home villages, and throughout we see people who are in all seriousness convinced that all the faults stem from local or midlevel officials and if only they can get word to the Emperor in Beijing all will be made well. This naive faith, which initially strikes one as pathetic & moronic & lacking any critical thinking makes me wonder if it could also be related to how China seems to have vastly outperformed India in the past decades, since it switched to sane economic policies; if the Chinese people's faith and hard work could lead to such utter disaster when applied to futile policies, does it yield equally unusual results when finally applied correctly?

Particularly surprising is Tooze's description of how impoverished Germany was in comparison to rival countries (despite the gleaming technology and Blitzkrieg we associate with Nazi Germany, and the industrial conglomerates like IG Farben with Imperial Germany, most of Germany was still rural & unproductive, and the country abjectly dependent on imports to maintain its agriculture; Tooze includes a very telling anecdote: Ford Motors, when considering a plant in Germany, found that to give its blue-collar American workers their accustomed lifestyle would require expenses 4x that of normal blue-collar German workers; and horses will feature repeatedly throughout). Tooze also does a good job delineating how the Holocaust both exacerbated and helped with the severe labor & resource problems Nazi Germany began facing, and covers how it was a logical outcome of earlier policies: emigration failed because the German balance of payments did not allow for the Jews to leave with anything like their actual wealth, and unsurprisingly many Jews were not so fearful as to emigrate penniless, and starvation in camps was not far from the earlier Wehrmacht plan to make the conquest of the Ukraine pay by simply starving to death 30 million Slavs to free up food harvests. Indeed, given all the constraints and necessary imports in the 1930s and 1940s, one really has to wonder how contemporary Germany can be so wealthy and whether it really is due to labor reforms or thanks to the Euro...<br/><br/>One flaw is that Tooze freely goes from macro to micro, from the overall economy to very small subindustries or benchmarks, and it's easy to get lost. And while the book covers the international finance in enough detail to understand it (and things like why Schacht was the 'dark wizard of international finance'), I don't think he does as good a job as <i>Lords of Finance</i>, which should probably be read before <i>Wages of Destruction</i> so one understands the international gold standard, and the French and British actions in the inter-war period.

Roach comes up with all the best quotes and stories, seems to have talked to everyone and done everything. And her running commentary is also hilarious - she's almost as funny as she thinks she is. I laughed many times reading the book.<br/><br/>This is definitely more "mind candy" than educational as it jumps from food to sex to hygiene to acceleration issues to psychology without any overview or unifying ideas or concepts, although I did learn a fair bit anyway from the scattershot approach. (One chapter was a revelation for me in explaining why <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Sand#scanners-live-in-vain-as-realistic-sf">early science fiction</a> often postulated space driving people insane). If there is any big picture to *Packing for Mars*, it's that outer space is *really* hard for humans to survive in and everyone & everything has to be studied in microscopic detail for anyone to go there and come back alive. Reading all the checks and modifications and details, one is boggled that we made it to the Moon, much less we be musing a Mars mission.<br/><br/>(It makes for a pretty compelling argument that humans just don't belong in space and that if we put half as much effort/time/money into automated exploration, we would know far more about the universe than we do - apparently, the ISS has cost us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Programme_cost"><i>\$150 billion</i></a>‽ Roach is aware that this is the impression she gives in her conclusion where she criticizes 'simulations', but honestly, I didn't find it a very compelling defense of the enormous difficulties & costs of shooting up some monkeys to walk around Mars compared to just sending probes.)<br/><br/>I compiled some excerpts from most of the chapters:<br/><br/>- chapters <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/jmWazbnemdz">1-2</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/UygTUTr6JxN">3</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/TCXnbJPsM4f">4-5</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Ri2n4YzMNkf">6-7</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/5YfPihkd2Bz">8</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/EZBkXDcU1Zs">9</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/cALb6LEWKx8">10</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Ksf8iYRutuL">11</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/BD5TZJTbwtE">12</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/LRBW1xsM2HU">13</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Y3UUadXni7i">14-15</a><br/>- <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/A3UtFXZbZtn">endnotes</a>

Dyson                  ★★★★     2012   2012/09/06   Mixed feelings. On the one hand, Dyson digs up all sorts of quotable lines and anecdotes and biographical details, many genuinely new to me. I enjoyed those greatly. For these I give it 4 stars. On the other hand...<br/><br/>He is obsessed with Von Neumann's IAS/MANIAC, to the detriment of the rest of the book. The pre-WWII history is OK but signally fails to explain things like the Hilbert program, Goedel or Turing's actual halting theorem. Someone who read this expecting to understand 'Turing's cathedral' would be vastly better served reading a book like Hofstadter's *Goedel, Escher, Bach* (as old as it is). Instead, countless pages are taken up with detailed technical information that is simultaneously in depth and also poorly explained. I repeatedly got the feeling that Dyson is indulging in that common temptation, allocating material based on how much effort it took to find, not what would inform the reader - he went through a lot of work documenting MANIAC and the rest of us must enjoy (suffer) the fruits of it. I felt that if I didn't already know a great deal of this material, I would be completely lost inside the book; I wonder how much other people could get out of it.<br/><br/>The repeated analogies to search engines and modern computing come off very poorly (search engines are analogue? Oookkaayyy....); much could have been said about how modern chip architectures and cloud computing designs are not very Von Neumannian now, so here again I wonder if it's a forced attempt to show contemporary relevance or perhaps just influence from his Google visit.<br/><br/>Other parts make one question how much Dyson understands: he links Goedelian/Turing incompleteness to computer viruses and concludes with grand '90s-esque visions (pace Kevin Kelly's old *Out of Control* book) of viruses spreading out through the Internet and beating on the walls of clean computers - but viruses aren't really a problem these days, nothing like they used to be, and the situation seems apt to only improve! Like spam, the solutions are not perfect and require a great deal of manpower & cleverness, but they are working and currently seem likely to steadily improve; this wouldn't be a surprise to him if he had really appreciated that Goedelian/Turing-incompleteness implies that there *are* large decidable subsets of programs and we can build our systems out of those. (Every programmer who uses a language with a decent type system is doing something a naive understanding of incompleteness says is impossible: he's executing nontrivial predicates over his program.)<br/><br/>For those reasons and others, this will never get 5 stars from me, and if there were a 3.5 stars, I'd go with that.

It uses the device of a frame story around a flashback which is the meat of the novella. The frame story is a sad divorced English artist returning to where he grew up for a funeral, and recollecting the circumstances. This aspect is dry, mannered, and reminscent of Mitchell's <i>Black Swan Green</i> or Kazuo Ishiguro. The flashback is vintage Gaiman, with a plot predictable by anyone's who's read his young adult works (particularly <i>Coraline</i>): an ordinary person meets uncanny folk, gets inadvertently involved in deep matters, goes through hell, defeats the enemy, and survives more mature for it. The narrator is wry, with many acute observations (indeed, why <i>do</i> so many people destroy pea by overcooking them when they're tasty on their own?), and the antagonist is exceedingly cruel & clever in seducing & turning the protagonist's family against him. It's a quick read of perhaps 2 hours, and is not especially complex: the work is almost entirely set at the protagonist's home or the Hempstock farm, and shows its origins as a short story.<br/><br/>What makes this more than Gaiman going back to the well of mythos he has drawn from so many times before (oh look, <i>another</i> triune of mysterious powerful women! oh look, the fairy tale motif of the one forbidden action & of course the character does it) is the frame story's tone of sadness and loss and wasted opportunity which otherwise shows up rarely in Gaiman's fiction - it's comparable to the death of the Sandman. By the end, the protagonist is pitiable: it was his fault, time and again, and ultimately the sacrifice was for him, and what has he done with his life? Little enough. As the shadows warn him, "There can never be a time when you forget them, when you are not, in your heart, questing after something you cannot have, something you cannot even properly imagine, the lack of which will spoil your sleep and your day and your life, until you close your eyes for the final time, until your loved ones give you poison and sell you to anatomy, and even then you will die with a hole inside you, and you will wail and curse at a life ill-lived." At the end, the best the trinity can say for him is that he's growing a new heart. Not that he'll remember even that faint progress report.<br/><br/>It's an interesting combo, and helps excuse some of the lamer bits. (Talk of electrons is jarringly out of place in a Gaiman work, and some aspects are too explicit about fantasy elements better left for the reader to wonder about.)


  *[In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1416596585&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                       Steven Levy                      ★★★★     2011   2013/03/24   I learned a great deal from this book about Google, which put some of my own experiences with Google products in context. Levy has information, anecdotes, quotes, and interviews which no one else does, which, like the recent Steve Jobs biography, makes his book indispensable for anyone interested in the topic regardless of the book's other merits.<br/><br/>To continue the Jobs analogy, I *think* Levy is more independent of his subject and more willing to criticize it and poke holes in their narratives - he covers the criticisms I expected, doesn't drop any particularly glaring issues, and more than once undermines their narratives with contrasting quotes & observations. In particular, Page repeatedly comes off as a narcissistic paranoid asshole, possibly due to his father's death, who cannot empathize with others or understand their points of views (a trait perhaps endemic of Googlers, to judge by the Buzz fiasco).<br/><br/>But to compensate for all the great info and explanations (more than once I thought to myself, 'ah, so *that* is what happened!'), there are downsides to the book. The principle one being:<br/><br/>Levy's writing/presentation is extremely journalistic and dumbed down. I'm not sure whether Levy simply doesn't understand programming & computers very well despite his long career covering the tech industry, or if he deliberately treats technical topics simplistically. (A description of JavaScript prefixes it with the undefined buzzword 'dynamic', although dynamic runtime typing is far from the most important aspect of JS; someone writing an early web spider is described as having a break through when they realize they can make it multithreaded, while I'm sitting back and thinking "there is no way that even in \~1995, any programmer, upon noticing that their web spider was not crawling as many URLs as he needs, would not instantly reach for multiprocessing/multithreading".) Similar simplisticness applied to the legal discussions as well (you won't come away with a real understanding of all the legal issues at play in the Google Books contretemps), and the economic ones fared much the same (I was glad Levy covered the auction innovations at Google, but couldn't he explain *why* second-price auctions are so elegant and effective?).


  *[Proving History: Bayes's Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1616145595&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                           Richard Carrier                  ★★★★     2012   2012/10/31   Overall, it's an interesting book which I regard as basically correct and a fruitful approach for future research, and Richard Carrier is a good guy whose work should be supported.<br/><br/>On the other hand, so far it's not quite as awesome as I was hoping it'd be when I was writing an essay on <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20script">identifying the author of the <i>Death Note</i> movie script with Bayesian reasoning</a> recently - I think Luke Muehlhauser was right in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9pm/minireview_proving_history_bayes_theorem_and_the/">his LessWrong review</a> that Carrier does his case a disservice by trying to expound Bayesian ideas in a New Testament context where, half the point of Bayesian ideas is to point out how useless the evidence is! That's... not a good way to either demonstrate Bayes is good in history nor to convince people of his overarching claims like 'all correct historical inference is Bayesian inference'.<br/><br/>The way to introduce a new paradigm is to start with its *successes*, where Bayesian methods led to a correct prediction or retrodiction of an issue where decisive evidence surfaced while before the issue was settled, conventional methods were confused, wrong, or underconfident; and *then* argue that its practical success combined with your philosophical arguments about Bayesian reasoning being the only correct reasoning is a convincing synthesis, maybe then work out verdicts/predictions/retrodictions on a non-controversial area so the experts can see how they like the conclusions, and only *then* extend it to highly controversial and difficult (scarce or low-quality evidence) material.<br/><br/>I understand how he would come to write it that way since that's what he was paid to do and Biblical material has become his specialty but I can still regret that the outcome wasn't as good as it could've been.

They engage in a virtual courtship, things get funny and romantic, until suddenly things take a <i>most puzzling and mysterious turn</i>.<br/><br><br/>It’s all quite nuttily modern. <i>Wired Love</i> anticipates everything we live with in today’s online, Iphoned courtship: Assessing whether someone you’ve met online is what they say they are; the misunderstandings of tone and substance that come from communicating in rapid-fire, conversational bursts of text; or even the fact that you might not really be sure of the gender/nationality/species of the person you’re flirting with.</blockquote><br/><br/>And also teens mooning over their cellphones!<br/><br/><blockquote>"...and what with that and the telephone and that dreadful phonograph that bottles up all one says and disgorges at inconvenient times, we will soon be able to do everything by electricity; who knows but some genius will invent something for the especial use of lovers? something, for instance, to carry in their pockets, so when they are far away from each other, and pine for a sound of 'that beloved voice', they will have only to take up this electrical apparatus, and be happy. Ah! blissful lovers of the future!"</blockquote><br/><br/>As promised, this was a very amusing Victorian novel, an easy read (perhaps a night's worth), and the telegraphs were fascinatingly Internet-chat-like.﻿

In fact, it's a little depressing that we don't seem to have gone much beyond that in the half-century since this was published back in 1945 or so. While at least we no longer need his defense of the unconscious as a meaningful part of cognition, much of the rest is depressingly familiar - for example, his acute observations on mental imagery & people who solely think in words, and mention of Francis Galton's survey (little-known outside of psychology), could be usefully read by many who commit the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">typical mind fallacy</a>.<br/><br/>If Hadamard comes to no hard and fast conclusions, but merely raises many interesting points and criticizes a number of theories, we can hardly hold that against him, as we can do little better and so it becomes our failing, not his.<br/><br/>(I read the <a href="https://archive.org/details/eassayonthepsych006281mbp">Internet Archive</a> scan.)

They used to be so important, major matters of national prestige, key mechanisms in the spread of art (especially Japanese art, at the Paris one) and technology, and yet, they are completely forgotten; I hadn't even heard of them until they came up in *Men in Black* because some leftover buildings got used in the movie. But as Larson tells the story, we learn that they were mega-events to which all celebrities attended, and a good fraction of the entire American population would attend; they were the originals of which Disney's Epcot is the palest imitation, they were the reason we have the Eiffel Tower and the Ferris wheel and so many other things. This story is the fascinating story, and it's almost a pity that Larson periodically interrupts the tale of the Chicago one to tell us more about Holmes, rather than giving us real photos and more stories from the fair (photos like those in Appelbaum's *The Chicago World's Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record*): after all we are told about the Court of Honor, it's sad to be given only a tiny glimpse of it, and it's really a pity we read only a few 'con stories', as it were, from the event itself. But so it goes.

Cleckley               ★★★★     2003   2012/12/21   Cleckley scatters through this book constant fascinating anecdotes and remarks, some so outrageous or remarkable that one would assume he made them up if he were writing on some other topic.<br/><br/>Cleckley's moralizing and occasional very old-fashioned comments are occasionally as interesting, and reading him in 2012, one feels very strongly just how distant (in a social mores sense) we are from him in the 1940s and earlier - when he writes of 'miscegenation' (I wonder how many teenagers now could tell you what 'sexual miscegenation' is), when he defends homosexuals as possibly not insane but sometimes even decent people, or when he speaks in horror of female psychopaths not guarding their virginity, or in a half-page fulminating against the hippies, or when he speculates that a healthy male adult might - after several years stranded on a desert island - enjoy masturbation (no, really?).<br/><br/>Sadly, Cleckley is not nearly as dated as one would hope after reading something like 200 pages detailing the endless wake of destruction, fraud, violence, deception, manipulation, and criminality: his basic conclusion that there are no effective treatments for psychopathy, and all previous attempts have been expensive failures, seems to remain true. Indeed, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/fzy/notes_on_psychopathy/">some attempts at treatment</a> have backfired and resulted in even more crime being committed by subjects.

I picked up the e-book, reader it in FBreader on my laptop, and... I'm not really impressed.

Even when you think it's done on Mt Ararat (and Powers has in a final flourish explained Philby dying shortly before the Berlin Wall), the plot isn't entirely over and there are multiple more deceptions and operations to go. And to top it all off, Powers takes an afterword to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">"show his work"</a> and reveal how Cold War history was <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakierThanFiction">"freakier than fiction"</a> (in TvTropes terms), but it's hard to blame him for not being really pleased with some of the genuine incidents he works in. (The exploding car with Philby wearing a fox cape and escaping with a minor injury while everyone else died? *Real*. I was shocked.)

Particularly since many of his subjects are wild birds and stealthy wolves. The ninety images stand strong, each on their own, but the complete symphony is one of the most impressive acts of mindfulness I’ve seen.</blockquote><br/><br/>After finishing looking through it, I could not disagree too much. It is one of the best photo books I have seen. The subject matter is much less profound and terrifying than <i>100 Suns</i>, but the general quality is higher. More than once I found myself wondering if Brandenburg was lying - these photos are too good and catch too many moments perfectly, surely he couldn't've possibly <i>really</i> taken only 1 photograph a day and these were them, surely he sometimes took hundreds and is covering them up? But so it seems.

I enjoyed the book a lot; McGrayne has a good eye for the amusing details, and she conveys at least some of the intuition (although some graphs or examples would have helped the reader - I liked the flipping coin illustrations in Dasivia 2006 *Bayesian Data Analysis*). It's also remarkably synoptic: I was repeatedly surprised by names popping up in the chronology, like BUGS, Bretthorst, Fisher's smoking papers, Diaconis, the actuarial use of Bayes etc, and I have a better impression of Laplace and Good's many contributions. The math was very light, which undermines the value of much of it since unless one is already an expert one doesn't know how much the author is falsifying (for the best reasons), and means that some connections are missed (like empirical Bayes being a forerunner of hierarchical modeling, which aren't well-explained themselves).

I knew only the bare outlines of Ramanujan's story, but I think this does an excellent job in fleshing the famous anecdotes out; for example, I hadn't realized how long he had twisted in the wind before his famous letter to Hardy, nor that he had spent a full year and more in India in a position before finally being brought to Cambridge. While Kanigel goes overboard in his novelistic scene-setting and psychologizing, one cannot say he does not try to set the scene for one and go beyond a bare recitations of events to the actual feel and texture of life in various places or of various persons; particularly noteworthy is his attempts to explain at least a little of the actual math which made Ramanujan worth a biography, beyond his romantic story, and here I think Kanigel does a really good job for the layman.


  *[Debt: The First 5,000 Years](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1933633867&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                       David Graeber                    ★★★★     2011   2011/09/24   Mixed feelings: many interesting little tidbits and quotes, but overall I get the feel of a vast thesis made up of confirmation bias and unreliable evidence like etymologies; some parts are flabbergastingly wrong, like his brief description of Apple Computer's founding. (He apparently routinely makes factual mistakes; <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/04/david-graeber-april-fools-day-post.html">Brad DeLong</a> apparently identified 50 in chapter 12 just to make that point.)<br/><br/>And while he's very cynical about things he's against, he exhibits a strange lack of cynicism about his in-groups (like the idle poor, or China - accusing the US of manipulating the rates!) Emphasizing the rather ideological bent of the book is his very thin skin as exhibited in response to online criticism like on Crooked Timber.

Depicts how Russia fell into the middle-income trap and stagnated, and illuminates the early growth of Russia's industrialization and why Khrushchev thought Russia could bury the US (not in dirt, but manufactured goods). Elegiac, enlightening, sympathetic.<br/><br/>Further reading: <br/><br/>- <a href="http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/918.html">In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves <i>You</i></a>, Cosma Shalizi (<a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you/">discussion</a>)<br/>- <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090302203414/http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/myth.html">"The Myth of Asia's Miracle"</a>, Paul Krugman

I can't fault Luthor's analysis of the many risks of Superman or the ethics of his powers, and the plot develops well, finishing in an ending which however unexpected and abrupt is perfectly consistent with the plotter and thinker and careful preparer for all contingencies Luthor is shown as. But to some extent it leaves me cold - difficult to pin down what, but I think the writing may simply be too precise, dry, bloodless to really let me be absorbed by the story.

Did it yield any caliphates, say? Anarchistic self-governing communes? Self-governing city-states? Hanseatic Leagues? Or look at official rhetoric in places like China. Look at the gradual and continuing expansion of capitalism and democracy as the defaults for every country. Look at the discrediting of Putin's Russian cronyism approach, or at the Muslim world's shift away from marginal Salafist groups like al-Qaeda.<br/><br/>*Fukuyama was right. There are no credible alternatives to the capitalist liberal democracy paradigm.*

He cites Tocqueville approvingly on the lack of coherence of the narrative of the French Revolution with the observed facts that the French had never had it better than before the Revolution - but how can I then have any confidence in any of *his* narratives?

Pluses included no more Taken popping up, we saw very little of Goblin or One-eye, and soap-operatic twist at the end aside, the overall plot has built up nicely.

Needham), his takes on modern Chinese history is very interesting, and I learned a number of things I did not know before (I was shocked to learn that the Soviets at one point seriously considered pre-emptively attacking China's nuclear program and had reached out to the USA to ask whether the USA would be <i>very</i> upset about it?).

I already knew a lot of it from Lawrence Lessig and related copyright books & writings, but Tim Wu puts the history together nicely, and renders the 2000s a little clearer (not that I really needed to be told that Apple/Jobs are a clear incarnation of the empire-building trend; this was obvious even when Neal Stephenson pointed it out many years ago in <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html">"In The Beginning Was The Commandline..."</a> )

Finney                ★★★★     2002   2011/10/20   The book comes up often in Wolfe discussions of *An Evil Guest*, I noticed there was a copy on library.nu, so...<br/><br/>Short, but fairly funny; ending wasn't quite as expected, but the dramatis personae and especially the section of questions listing contradictions/mistakes/obscurities made up for my lingering dissatisfaction. Don't think it was directly useful for interpreting Wolfe's *An Evil Guest*, but the dramatis personae is a clear inspiration for Wolfe's own character lists.

Desensitized by the end. Not sure how to take it, but disagree with the protagonist - I don't understand his constant depravity and murdering, and I don't agree I would do much the same thing in his position. One or two murders, maybe, but even killing his best friend Thomas who time and again saved Aue's ass?

That said, I would have liked a lot more of those quotes about conspiracies and the origins of the plans to enslave the colonies for private profit, and much less paraphrase & political theorizing.

It throws in all the classic anecdotes and quotes you expect, doesn't try to whitewash Feynman and includes some critical examination, does make an effort to explain all the physics which earned Feynman his prestige, etc. It's a well-regarded widely-read biography which I have nothing to say against.


  *[Friendship is Optimal](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              iceman                           ★★★★     2012                It's an excellent dystopia which makes you feel that it's hell - but also better than our reality.<br/><br/>But as great as the premise is, and as chilling (or thrilling?) as the results are, on reflection I'm not quite sure I can give this a rare 5-stars (as I did initially): the prose is a little too journeyman-like, the characters a little too undifferentiated.


  *[Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1451648537&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Walter Isaacson                  ★★★★     2011   2011/10/24   Long but good biography; in some respects, too cheerleading of Jobs (balanced by Isaacson not truckling *too* much and being willing to cover the ugly parts of Jobs's life). But overall, a good detailed bio. I do not admire Jobs - perhaps if he were less neurotic or chewed through people less, but I respect him: he was a real mensch.


  *[Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron (Shades of Grey, \#1)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0670019631&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                    Jasper Fforde                    ★★★★     2009   2013/03/29   Post-apocalyptic *Flatland* meets *Hunger Games* via *Paranoia* - that is, an insane bureaucratic totalitarian Victorian nightmare mediated by color perception whose protagonists rebel against the order of things instituted after some doomsday. I enjoyed it a lot.


  *[I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1451650515&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                               Lori Andrews                     ★★★★     2012                Remarkably thoroughly researched, with endless references and anecdotes, which is an achievement indeed for a topic as ephemeral and changing as social media. (I didn't think too much of its critical analysis or conclusions, but the rest more than made up for it.)


  *[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0385721862&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                    Amy Chua                         ★★★★     2004                That was actually pretty good (better than one might guess from reading the discussions of her later tiger-mother book), many interesting observations. Her paradigm seems pretty generally applicable outside the First World. I took extensive notes.


  *[Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0307377342&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                              David Eagleman                   ★★★★     2009                40 very short stories in the tradition of Borges, Calvino, and Stanislaw Lem (in ascending order). Overall, pretty good, although naturally the quality level varies considerably and the parables that spoke to me will not speak to others.


  *[The Black Cloud](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0899683444&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Fred Hoyle                       ★★★★     1998   2010/12/01   Good frame story, good science, good possibilities - the black cloud is still a novel proposal and interesting to think about in a panspermia context. Mind candy. (And short enough it doesn't wear out its welcome.)


  *[Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0520248198&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                Kathryn Edin                     ★★★★     2007   2011/11/13   Incredibly sobering, explains a lot about inner-city illegitimacy, and the best thing I've read about the topic and why women would do something which from far away seems like a completely terrible idea.


  *[Intelligence: A Unifying Construct for the Social Sciences](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0956881181&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                        Richard Lynn                     ★★★★     2012   2012/08/14   Very wonky, of course, but still many interesting correlation; I excerpted parts I found interesting to a <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/5MZd5xW47u9">Google+ post</a>.

  *[Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0300102852&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                              Takashi Murakami                 ★★★★     2005   2011/11/24   Main use for this book: encyclopedia entries, Murakami's long essay, the dialogue with Okada - rest is completely impenetrable, featuring fine gobbledegook.


  *[Snuff (Discworld, \#39)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=038561926X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Terry Pratchett                  ★★★★     2011   2011/11/17   Curiously, this is the least funny but probably best Discworld book I've read so far. Vimes has grown a great deal since we first met him.

One doesn't expect such ancient contemporary humor to translate well.

That said, enough time has passed since 1988 to enable us to judge the basic truthfulness of a lot of the predictions and expectations held by the dreamers such as Nicholas Negroponte: & they were <i>remarkably accurate</i>!<br/><br/>If you aren't struck by a sense of déjà vu or pity when you read this book, compare the people at the Media Lab with contemporary works like Cliff Stoll's <i>Silicon Snake Oil</i>, & you'll see how right they were. <br/><br/>But the sad thing is noting how few future millionaires & billionaires grace the page of TML - one quickly realizes that yes, person X was absolutely 100% right about Y happening even when everyone thought that was insane, but X was off by a few years & jumped the gun & so Z was the person who wound up taking all the spoils. I read it constantly thinking 'yes, you were right, for all the good it did you' or 'not quite, it'd actually take another decade for that to really work out'.<br/><br/>"If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?" The lesson I draw is: it is not enough to predict the future, one has to get the timing right to not be ruined. To borrow from my LW comments (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/e6j/the_brain_preservation_foundation_still_needs/8tny">1</a>/<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/h5x/bitcoin_cryonics_fund/8qew">2</a>/<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/453/procedural_knowledge_gaps/8rap?context=1">3</a>):<br/><br/>A good idea will draw overly-optimistic entrepreneurs to it like moths to a flame: all get immolated but the one with the dumb luck to kiss the flame at the perfect instant. (How many payment startup were there before Paypal? How many social networks before Facebook? How many search engines before Google?) How can you catch a falling knife?<br/><br/>Many 'bubbles' can be interpreted as people being 100% correct the future - but missing the <i>timing</i> (<a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5646">Thiel's article on China & bubbles</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21575737-lessons-americas-long-history-property-booms-betting-house"><i>The Economist</i> on obscure property booms</a>, Garber's <i>Famous First Bubbles</i>). Consider the ill-fated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com">Pets.com</a>: was the investor right to believe that Americans would spend a ton of money online such as for buying dogfood? Absolutely, Amazon (which has rarely turned a profit & has sucked up far more investment than Pets.com ever did) is a successful online retail business that stocks thousands of dog food varieties, to say nothing of all the other pet-related goods it sells. But the value of Pets.com stock still went to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2000/11/16/1116simons.html">\~\$0</a>. Many startups have a long list of failed predecessors who tried to do pretty much the same thing, & what made them a success was that they happened to give the pinata a whack at the exact moment where some cost curves or events hit the right point. (Facebook is the biggest archive of photographs there has ever been, with truly colossal storage requirements; could it have succeeded in the 1990s? No, & not even later, as demonstrated by Orkut & Friendster, & the lingering death of MySpace.) You can read books from the past about tech visionaries & note how many of them were spot-on in their beliefs about what would happen (<i>The Media Lab</i> is a great example, but far from the only one) but where a person would have been ill-advised to act on the correct forecasts. Or look at computers: imagine an early adopter of an Apple computer saying 'everyone will use computers eventually!' Yes, but not for another few decades, & 'in the long run, we are all dead'.<br/><br/>Examples of this pop up all the time. I watched impressed recently as my aunt used the iPhone application FaceTime to videophone with her daughter half a continent away, & though about how people were disappointed by the failure of videophones in the '90s & previous & then concluded that perhaps people didn't <i>really</i> want videophones at all - but really, it looks like the videophones back then simply weren't good enough! & I've noticed geeks express wonderment at the Oculus Rift looking like it'll bring Virtual Reality to the masses, & won't that be a real kick in the teeth for Cliff Stoll or Jaron Lanier (who gave up VR for dead ages ago & has earned his daily bread being court jester to the elites & criticizing them)?<br/><br/>Smartphones are an even bigger example of this. How often did I read in the '90s & early '00s about how amazing Japanese cellphones were & how amazing a good smartphone would be, even though year after year the phones were jokes & used pretty much solely for voice? You can even see the smartphones come up again & again in TML, as the visionaries realize how transformative a mobile pocket-sized computer would be. Yet, it took until the mid-00s for the promise of smartphones to materialize overnight. I was reminded of this recently reading an interview with <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2013/09/17/an-interview-by-eric-jackson-on-blogging-apple-and-whats-next/" title="My thanks to Eric Jackson for his thoughtful questions & post on Forbes.com.">Eric Jackson</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>Q: What’s your take on how they’re [Apple] handling their expansion into China, India, & other emerging markets?<br/><br><br/>A: It’s depressing how slow things are moving on that front. We can draw lines on a graph but we don’t know the constraints. Again, the issue with adoption is that the timing is so damn hard. I was expecting smartphones to take off in mid 2004 & was disappointed over & over again. & then suddenly a catalyst took hold & the adoption skyrocketed. Cook calls this “cracking the nut”. I don’t know what they can do to move faster but I suspect it has to do with placement (distribution) & with networks which both depend on (corrupt) entities.</blockquote><br/><br/>Or to look at VR; a recent <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality"><i>The Verge</i></a> article on VR took a historical look back at past efforts, & what's striking is that VR was arguably thought of back in the 1950s or so, more than half a century before the computing power or monitors were remotely close to what was needed for truly usable VR. The idea of VR was that obvious, it was that overdetermined, & so compelling that VR pioneers resemble nothing so much as moths to the flame, garnering grants in the hopes that <i>this</i> time things will improve. & of course, the money was largely wasted, because researchers can spend arbitrary amounts of money on topics without anything to show for it. Scott Fisher:<br/><br/><blockquote>"I ended up doing more work in Japan than anything else because Japan in general is so tech-smitten & obsessed that they just love [VR]. The Japanese government in general was funding research, building huge research complexes just to focus on this. There were huge initiatives while there was nothing happening in the US. I ended up moving to Japan & working there for many years."</blockquote><br/><br/>Indeed, this would have around the Japanese boondoggle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer">Fifth Generation Project</a> (note that despite Japan's prowess at robotics, it is not Japan's robots who went into Fukushima / flying around the Middle East / revolutionizing agriculture & construction). All those 'huge initiatives' and...? Don't ask Fisher, he's hardly going to say, "yes, all the money was completely wasted, we were trying to do it too soon". Researchers in general have no incentive to say, "this is not the right time, wait another 20 years for Moore's law to make it doable", even if everyone in the field is perfectly aware of this - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey">Palmer Luckey</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>"I spent a huge amount of time reading...I think that there were a lot of people that were giving VR too much credit, because they were working as VR researchers. You don't want to publish a paper that says, 'After the study, we came to the conclusion that VR is useless right now & that we should just not have a job for 20 years.' There were a few people that basically came to that conclusion. They said, 'Current VR gear is low field of view, high lag, too expensive, too heavy, can't be driven properly from consumer-grade computers, or even professional-grade computers.' It turned out that I wasn't the first person to realize these problems. They'd been known for decades."</blockquote><br/><br/>And Lanier implies that Japan alone spent a <i>lot</i> of money:<br/><br/><blockquote><tt>Jaron Lanier</tt>: "The components have finally gotten cheap enough that we can start to talk about them as being accessible in the way that everybody's always wanted...Moore's law is so interesting because it's not just the same components getting cheaper, but it really changes the way you do things. For instance, in the old days, in order to tell where your head was so that you could position virtual content to be standing still relative to you, we used to have to use some kind of external reference point, which might be magnetic, ultrasonic, or optical. These days you put some kind of camera on the head & look around in the room & it just calculates where you are - the headsets are self-sufficient instead of relying on an external reference infrastructure. That was inconceivable before because it would have been just so expensive to do that calculation. Moore's law really just changes again & again, it re-factors your options in really subtle & interesting ways."</br><br/><tt>Kevin Kelly</tt>: "Our sense of history in this world is very dim & very short. We were talking about the past: VR wasn't talked about for a long time, right? Thirty-five years. Most people have no idea that this is 35 years old. Thirty years later, it's the same headlines. Was the technological power just not sufficient 30 years ago?"</br><br/>...On the Nintendo Power Glove, based on a VPL dataglove design</br><br/><tt>JL</tt>: "Both I & a lot of other people really, really wanted to get a consumerable version of this stuff out. We managed to get a taste of the experience with something called the Power Glove...Sony actually brought out a little near-eye display called Virtual Boy; not very good, but they gave it their best shot. & there were huge projects that have never been shown to the public to try to make a consumable [VR product], very expensive ones. Counting for inflation, probably more money was spent [than] than Facebook just spent on Oculus. We just could never, never, never get it quite there."</br><br/><tt>KK</tt>: "Because?"</br><br/><tt>JL</tt>: "The component cost. It's Moore's law. Sensors, displays... batteries! Batteries is a big one."</blockquote><br/><br/><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-most-ridiculous-startup-ideas-that-eventually-became-successful/answer/Michael-Wolfe">Michael Wolfe</a> offers some examples of this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/><ul><br/><li>Facebook - the world needs yet another Myspace or Friendster except several years late. We’ll only open it up to a few thousand overworked, anti-social, Ivy Leaguers. Everyone else will then join since Harvard students are so cool.</li><br/><li>Dropbox - we are going to build a file sharing & syncing solution when the market has a dozen of them that no one uses, supported by big companies like Microsoft. It will only do one thing well, & you’ll have to move all of your content to use it.</li><br/><li>Virgin Atlantic - airlines are cool. Let’s start one. How hard could it be? We’ll differentiate with a funny safety video & by not being a\*\*holes.<br /></li><br/><li>…iOS - a brand new operating system that doesn’t run a single one of the millions of applications that have been developed for Mac OS, Windows, or Linux. Only Apple can build apps for it. It won’t have cut & paste.</li><br/><li>Google - we are building the world’s 20th search engine at a time when most of the others have been abandoned as being commoditized money losers. We’ll strip out all of the ad-supported news & portal features so you won’t be distracted from using the free search stuff.</li><br/><li>Tesla - instead of just building batteries & selling them to Detroit, we are going to build our own cars from scratch plus own the distribution network. During a recession and a cleantech backlash.</li><br/><li>…Firefox - we are going to build a better web browser, even though 90% of the world’s computers already have a free one built in. One guy will do most of the work.</li><br/></ul><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Thiel (<i>Zero to One</i>): "Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them."; this is precisely the opposite of reality: Bill Gates was not the first & only Gates, he was the <i>last</i> Gates; many people made huge fortunes off OSes, both before & after Gates - you may have forgotten Wang, but hopefully you remember Steve Jobs (before, Mac) & Steve Jobs (after, NeXt). Mark Zuckerberg was not the first & only Zuckerberg, he was the last Zuckerberg; many people made fortunes before him - maybe Orkut didn't make its Google inventor a fortune, but you can bet that Myspace's DeWolfe & Anderson did well. & there were plenty of lucrative search engine founders (is Jerry Yang a billionaire? Yes.)<br/><br/>Certainty is irrelevant, you still have problems making use of this knowledge. Example: in retrospect, we know everyone wanted computers, OSes, social networks - but the history of them is strewn with flaming rubble. Suppose you somehow knew in 2000 that "in 2010, the founder of the most successful social network will be worth at least \$10b"; this is a falsifiable belief at odds with all conventional wisdom & about a tech that blindsided everyone. Yet, how useful would this knowledge be, <i>really</i>? What would you do with it? Do you have the capital to start a VC & throw multi-million-dollar investments at every social media until finally in 2010 you knew for sure that Facebook was the winning ticket & could cash out in the IPO? I doubt it.<br/><br/>It's difficult to invest . There is no convenient CMPTR you can buy 100 shares of & hold indefinitely to capture gains from your optimism about computers. IBM & Apple both went nearly bankrupt at points, & Microsoft's stock has been flat since 1999 or whenever (translating to huge real losses & opportunity costs to long-term holders of it). If you knew for certain that Facebook would be as huge as it was, what stocks, exactly, could you have invested in, pre-IPO, to capture gains from its growth? Remember, you don't know anything else about the tech landscape in the 2000s, like that Google will go way up from its IPO, you don't know about Apple's revival under Jobs - all you know is that a social network will exist & will grow hugely. The best I can think of would be to sell any Murdoch stock you owned when you heard they were buying MySpace, but offhand I'm not sure that Murdoch didn't just stagnate rather than drop as MySpace increasingly turned out to be a writeoff. In the hypothetical that you didn't know the name of the company, you might've bought up a bunch of Google stock hoping that Orkut would be the winner, but while that would've been a decent investment (yay!) it would have had nothing to do with Orkut (awww!); illustrating the problem with highly illiquid markets in some areas...<br/><br/>And even when there are stocks available to buy, you only benefit based on the specifics - like one of the existing stocks being a winner, rather than all the stocks being eaten by some new startup. Let's imagine a different scenario, where instead you were confident that home robotics were about to experience a huge growth spurt. Is this even nonpublic knowledge at all? The world economy grows at something like 2% a year, labor costs generally seem to go up, prices of computers & robotics usually falls... Do industry projections expect to grow their sales by \<25% a year?<br/><br/>But say that the market is wrongly pessimistic. If so, you might spend some of your hypothetical money on whatever the best approximation to a robotics index fund you can find, as the best of a bunch of bad choices. (Checking a few random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Robotics_companies">entries in Wikipedia</a>, maybe a fifth of the companies are publicly traded, so... that will be a pretty small index.) Suppose the home robotic growth were concentrated in a single private company which exploded into the billions of annual revenue & took away the market share of all the others, forcing them to go bankrupt or merge or shrink. Home robotics will have increased just as you believed - <i>keikaku doori</i>! - yet your 'index fund' gone bankrupt (reindex when one of the robotics companies collapses? Reindex into what,? Another doomed firm?). Then after your special knowledge has become public knowledge, the robotics company goes public, & by the Efficient Market Hypothesis, their shares then become a normal gamble where you could easily fail to outperform.<br/><br/>(Is this impossibly rare? Well, it sounds like Facebook! They grew fast, roflstomped other social networks, stayed private, & post-IPO, I believe investors have done the opposite of profit.)<br/><br/>And to make matter worse, because of the winner-take-all dynamics, there's no way to solve the coordination problem of just holding off on an approach until the prerequisites are in place: entrepreneurs & founders will be hurling themselves at an obvious goal like social networks or VR constantly, just on the off chance that <i>maybe</i> the prerequisites just became adequate & they'll be able to eat everyone's lunch. A predictable waste of money, perhaps, but that's how the incentives work out. The first person to try at the right time may win the lottery; Palmer Luckey (founder of Oculus, sold to Facebook for \~\$2 billion):<br/><br/><blockquote>"Here's a secret: the thing stopping people from making good VR & solving these problems was not technical. Someone could have built the Rift in mid-to-late 2007 for a few thousand dollars, & they could have built it in mid-2008 for about \$500. It's just nobody was paying attention to that."</blockquote><br/><br/>(At the margin, compared to other competitors in the VR space, did Luckey & co really create \$2b+ of new value? Or were they lucky in trying at the right time?)<br/><br/>It's a weird perspective to take, but we can think of other technologies which may be like this.<br/><br/>Bitcoin is a topical example: it's still in the early stages where it looks either like a genius stroke to invest in, or a fool's paradise/Ponzi scheme. We see what looks like a bubble as the price inflates from \~\$0 to \$130 as I write this, which look like a bubble - yet, if Bitcoin <i>were</i> the Real Deal, we would <i>expect</i> large price increases as people learn of it & it directly gains value from increased use, an ecosystem slowly unlocking the fancy cryptographic features, etc.<br/><br/>Or take niche visionary technologies: if cryonics was correct in principal, yet turned out to be worthless for everyone doing it before 2030 (because the wrong perfusion techniques or cryopreservatives were used & some critical bit of biology was not vitrified) while practical post-2030 say, it would simply be yet another technology where visionaries were ultimately right despite all nay-saying & skepticism from normals but nevertheless wrong in a practical sense because they jumped on it too early, & so they wasted their money.<br/><br/>When a knife drops, a fraction of a second divides a brilliant save from an emergency-room visit. The 'bleeding edge'.

His book is a mix of personal reminiscences, short biographies, primary documents & long quotations from memoirs, a diary contrasting '40s/'50s to his life in the '90s after a heart problem sent him to the hospital, and in this American edition a preface explaining the circumstances of an online release & appendix containing a few academic reviews of the English-translation manuscript.<br/><br/>As such, it is unique. The early American development of computing has been covered well & in detail by works such as Dyson's <i>Turing's Cathedral</i>, but Russian development is shrouded in obscurity. Before reading PoSS, about the only thing I knew about Soviet computing was that there wasn't much of it & that they had tried an interesting experiment in not binary but trinary or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer">ternary-based computers</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setun">Setun</a>. Any attempt to give an overview of the history is bound to be interesting. It also vividly conveys the oppression that they worked under: blacklisting of people for trivial reasons like having an unusual Greek surname, discouragement of Jews, stringent security checks (why? given that no one in the world cared), difficulty in acquiring parts, expensive production, opaque bureaucratic decision-making about what projects to fund & the consequence reliance on military sponsorship to cut through red tape... (but also some of the benefits, like spies & industrial espionage of American projects).<br/><br/>That said, the informativeness is limited by the chaotic organization of topics, bouncing from person to person. This book would have benefited a good deal from some graphs or timelines to help one keep things straight, especially as PoSS spends a lot of time on the many overlapping projects in the '40s-'50s to develop varying flavors of computers. For example, I often found myself confusing Lebedev with other pioneers. (The confusing nondescriptness of many organizations' names also didn't help.) Malinovsky also deliberately limits the discussion to computer hardware, mentioning that "Beyond the scope of this book is the whole range of Soviet software developed during the Cold War and the distinguished scientists behind it, this including A.A. Lyapunov, M.R. Shura-Bura, A.P. Ershov, V.M. Kurochkin, E.L. Yuschenko, and others"; unfortunately, it is the software developments which would still be comprehensible & of interest to technical readers, whose eyes glaze over at the endless mentions of hardware details like one kind of semiconductor chip vs a slightly larger kind of semiconductor chip; worse, it is difficult to evaluate hardware achievements without information about the software which ran on it, since code & hardware are a continuum (anyone can design an ultra-fast computer which is a nightmare to write for; indeed, that has oft happened).<br/><br/>Paton writes "Lebedev suggested that his students prepare and publish materials about the formation and development of computer technology in the Soviet Union. 'In the West, they consider us to be worse than we really are. We have to change their opinion of us', he said. Unfortunately, his idea was not properly implemented at that time and only now has been embodied in this book." Indeed... In his attempt, Malinovsky omits perspective/context & is biased, which overall render the book more a source for future historians writing a history of Soviet computing than a history itself. Malinovsky patriotically protests<br/><br/><blockquote>...the establishment and development of computer technology in the USSR advanced in the post-war years virtually without any contact with the Western scientists. The development of computers abroad was conducted secretly because at first, digital electronic computers were designated for military purposes. At the same time, the computer technology in the USSR evolved independently as well, led by top Soviet scientists.</blockquote><br/><br/>Despite repeated quotes how they would avidly study American publications for any available details! If he cannot say a Soviet computer is faster, then it used less parts, or was more reliable, or was built quicker, or a cluster of 76 (!) was faster than an American supercomputer... In the biographies, each & every pioneer is hardworking, kind, modest, attentive, & loyal, & how each created computers in breathtakingly short times & how every computer seemed to operate perfectly & be competitive with the fastest American machines, & how many superlatives each super pioneer deserved (backed up by endless mentions of awards that they received, or occasionally, didn't receive due to bureaucratic sabotage). As the Abbate review notes, "Occasionally the prose takes on a heroic or patriotic tone that may be jarring to American readers (though quite common in its Russian/Ukrainian context)." More importantly, through the book Malinovsky damns following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">IBM 360 paradigm</a> rather than continuing domestic lines of development; the Slava review:<br/><br/><blockquote>As a participant first-hand account, Malinovsky's book is both valuable & problematic. Like any other personal account, it is prone to certain biases. When Malinovsky touches upon controversial topics, he often provides only one side of the story. For example, the rivalry between the two first Soviet large-size digital computer projects, the BESM & the STRELA, is narrated largely from the viewpoint of the BESM camp. A historian would have written a more balanced account. Other topics that may require a historiographic commentary include the wide introduction of automated control systems actively promoted by the director of the Institute of Cybernetics in Kiev Viktor Glushkov (many observers claimed that this campaign led to inefficiency & waste) or the controversy over the decision to build the Unified Series of Computers that supposedly "copied" IBM 360 (Malinovsky claims that this decision directly led to the "demise" of the Soviet computer industry). In both cases, Malinovsky covers one side of the story in great detail but gives little voice to Glushkov's critics or to the supporters of the Unified Series, who claimed that Unified Series computers were no copies of IBM but were only software-compatible with IBM & had high performance characteristics. Anne Fitzpatrick's explanatory comments are very helpful; & it would be very beneficial for the reader if she could also address controversial historiographic issues, either in the endnotes or in the Introduction.<br/>The translator should be complimented on having done an excellent job in conveying the style of the original Russian text. This style, however, may sound a bit too heavy for an American reader, for it carries some of the typical features of Soviet-era formal discourse: too many nouns, the abundance of passive voice, overblown epithets, etc. Adjusting the style for an American audience would make the book much more readable.</blockquote><br/><br/>Malinovsky never really justifies his claims, and one wonders. The IBM 360 was a landmark design, successful in the market for all sorts of purposes, and in general, the computing market has been unkind to any attempts to take alternate paths from the current leading contender (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine">Lisp machines</a> being an example), as by doing so, one cuts oneself off from an entire world of innovation & Moore's law. (Vigoda: "In practice replacing digital computers with an alternative computing paradigm is a risky proposition. Alternative computing architectures, such as parallel digital computers have not tended to be commercially viable, because Moore's Law has consistently enabled conventional von Neumann architectures to render alternatives unnecessary. Besides Moore's Law, digital computing also benefits from mature tools & expertise for optimizing performance at all levels of the system: process technology, fundamental circuits, layout & algorithms. Many engineers are simultaneously working to improve every aspect of digital technology, while alternative technologies like analog computing do not have the same kind of industry juggernaut pushing them forward.") Isn't it more likely that Soviet computing could have gone down a dead end & stagnated permanently?<br/><br/>Indeed, there are many signs that Soviet computing could easily have disappeared up its own navel. For example, the parts dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Glushkov">Glushkov's</a> grandiose plans to turn the Soviet economy into a centrally-computer-planned cybernetic program by the 1970s - this sounds like complete idiocy to the modern mind, aware of the full complexity of a modern economy & how inefficient Soviet management was & how centralization inevitably fails & of the incredible computing power needed to efficiently run even a small chunk of the economy like Walmart or Amazon - & yet Malinovsky, even after the fall of the USSR & complete discrediting of centralized economies, seems to think it was a great idea killed by politicians & could have saved the USSR & Glushkov was a prophet rather than a dreamer! It's no surprise that the politicians were not eager to spend 20 billion rubles on a plan with no guarantee of working. And even has the chutzpah to claim "And now a huge information network - the Internet - is stretching across the Commonwealth of Newly Independent States and around the world, fulfilling Viktor Mikhailovich's dreams and predictions of forty years ago." The Glushkov sections also exemplify Malinovsky's willingness to claim credit for Soviet software achievements but not discuss any of the details, many of which sound like awful ideas or meaningless, leading one to wonder if he doesn't understand what he's talking about or just is bad at describing them eg he quotes Glushkov as writing:<br/><br/><blockquote>What was the difference between Mir & other computers? We considerably upgraded the machine language. However, back then the popular point of view was that machine language must be as simple as possible & the rest would be done by software. We were even mocked for our efforts to develop different computers. The majority of computer scientists in the world believed that it was necessary to develop computer-aided programming, that is, to create software that would help produce other programs.</blockquote><br/><br/>Yes, that was the popular view then & still is, because it's right. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing">RISC</a> is still the dominant view of Western computer scientists as baroque CISC architectures are always left in the dust. Glushkov was dead-wrong, but no mention is made of this. Or,<br/><br/><blockquote>In designing the Mir machines, we had tackled a daring problem - to match the machine language as close as possible to the human language, and here I mean mathematical nonverbal language, though later we made attempts with normal human language. So, we created 'Analytic,' a special mathematical language, supported by an internal interpretation system. Mir computers were used in all regions of the Soviet Union. Their creation became an intermediate stage in research aimed at the development of artificial intelligence, since the intelligence realized in them was still fairly primitive. It also looked very impressive when a machine quickly solved independent and dependent integrals, while not many professors of mathematics were able to solve them. In addition, the machine found substitutions, not just the easy ones from tables, but the difficult ones as well...the Mir computer family was quickly developed and put into serial production, receiving high marks from its users. Its creation was a giant step in the development of artificial intelligence in small computers.</blockquote><br/><br/>In what sense? Solving integrals isn't much of an accomplishment. What does it mean to "match the machine language as close as possible to the human language"? I'm not aware of any important work in AI stemming from USSR research. Or:<br/><br/><blockquote>Glushkov proposed a macro-conveyer principle based on the idea that each processor was given a separate task during every step of the computing process, which allowed it to work independently for a long time without the interference from other processors. In 1959, at the Soviet All-Union Conference on Computer Technology in Kiev, Glushkov spoke about the idea of a brain-like computer structure that could be realized when the designers were able to integrate not thousands, but billions of elements with practically limitless connections between them, into a single system. There would also be a confluence of memory and data processing, a system in which data would be processed throughout the memory with a highest possible degree of parallelism in all operations...only the development of new non-Von Neumann computer architecture...would solve the problem of creating a supercomputer with unlimited growth in productivity and progressively more sophisticated hardware. Unfortunately, further research showed that a comprehensive realization of the construction principles of recursive computers and brain-like structures was beyond the level of electronic technology at that time.</blockquote><br/><br/>Despite being a programmer interested in AI, I have no idea what <i>any</i> of it means. This culminates in idiotic boasting: "Unfortunately, the potential of the Mir computer line was never fully realized. During my 1979 presentation in Novosibirsk on the integration of artificial intelligence into computers, I heard the academician Andrei Ershov criticize the Institute of Cybernetics by saying: 'If you had not stopped upgrading the Mir family, the USSR would have had the best personal computers in the world.'" No, there was 0 chance. Not in a system as pathological/impoverished/repressed as the USSR was - there were no opportunities for the economies of scale which power microchip development, & if there had, PCs would never have been allowed outside of a few restricted roles. The whole point of the PC revolution in America was that anyone, including little kids who would grow up to be great programmers & entrepreneurs, could access cheap unrestricted computing power for the most trivial of reasons & create whatever they wanted to without friction.<br/><br/>Nor was Glushkov alone. No matter how much dead, he'll still hold out hope that a dead end is not a dead end. "To this day, Brusentsov maintains that the trinary system is superior to binary, but only time will be able to tell whether or not he is correct" - how long should we wait, exactly? Or from the Setun article, we read that its programming language, DSSP, "was not invented. It was found. That is why DSSP has not versions, but only extensions. Forth is created by practice. DSSP is created by theory. It is not a word." This is pathological linguistic mysticism, one of the delusions of the 20th century - the idea that language is terribly important & that a better purer language would unlock wasted powers & enable undreamed-of productivity. If we could invent a more logical & compact language, if we could strip out the illusions built into language, if we could come up with a better one, we would solve AI / create world peace / become geniuses etc. What's the stock trope for becoming superintelligent in <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/futurelang.php">20th century</a> <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/linguistics">SF</a>? Your own language in which you can convey concepts more efficiently & fast; we see this in Heinlein's Speedtalk, Anderson's <i>Brain Wave</i>, even Chiang in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140527121332/http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/under.htm""Understand"</a> (and anything to do with that nebulous cluster of Californian stuff called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Potential_Movement"Human Potential</a>), or enthusiasm for conlangs like Loglan/Lojban... it's why <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer?currentPage=all" title="Utopian for Beginners: An amateur linguist loses control of the language he invented">Russian fascists intently studying Ithkuil</a> feel like such an anachronism. It is the fallacy that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">strong Sapir-Whorf</a> is correct, that languages powerfully shape thoughts rather than channel trivialities like color-name choices. The truth is that specialized languages & notations are indeed powerful, but they always <i>succeed</i> innovation & insight, not <i>precede</i> it: they codify powerful insights & choices, & can only be created after having had the insight they embody. to design a language before the powerful ideas it embodies is to put the cart before the horse. To go from Leibnizian calculus notation to say 'Lojban will make your life more awesome' is to ignore the specialization that gave the notation power. There are no general powerful insights you can embody in a language to turn its users into geniuses, although you can take the insights of past geniuses in statistics & design a specialized statistics language which is far better than ordinary language. Learning Ithkuil won't give you access to any ideas or heuristics you didn't have before, because natural language is already general & flexible. (Would Newspeak actually work? Consider Gene Wolfe's counter-example, <a href="http://www.kissofvampire.com/book2/Wolfe1614/41621.html">"Loyal to the Group of Seventeen's Story - The Just Man"</a> or the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/">Darmoks of <i>Star Trek</i></a>).<br/><br/>The politics of Soviet computing are interesting. There remains a great deal of lingering guilt & doubt around the Manhattan Project - whether it was really a good thing. scientists working on the SDI missile defense program are even more prickly about whether their work was harmful in destabilizing the precarious peace. One wonders about Russian counterparts: did they regret endeavoring mightily to put atomic bombs in the hands of a psychopath like Stalin? Or assisting bomb & ICBM development to ensure that all of humanity would live under a Damoclean sword? Or how about the environmental consequences, far from limited to Chernobyl. But there is no such doubt in the people Malinovsky quotes: "In retrospect, the rush was justified: possession of such missiles gave our country weapons parity with the United States."; 'Once, one of Sergei Alexeevich's daughters asked him: "Why do you make computers for the military?" He replied: "To avoid a war."'; etc. Indeed, the worse the USSR treated its researchers, the more loyal & devoted they seemed to become. For example, Rameev saw his grandfather expropriated, his father fatally purged under Stalin & his great invention stolen from him, & Rameev's conclusion? "a stern voice warned him: 'Live quietly & don't contact us ever again!' At that moment, Rameev understood that he had to do something unusual, outstanding, & very important for his people & nation in order to give his life meaning." Is that so? Or in the story of the researcher Akushsky who was threatened with summary execution because a plane went down, & who cleverly saves himself by proving it was the pilots' fault; very amusing, & chilling. Malinovsky blandly remarks at one point, "Things did not go smoothly at first because some Communist leaders overseeing the project remembered that Kisunko was the son of a repressed kulak."


  *[A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1594204462&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                          Nicholas Wade                    ★★★      2014   2014/09/24   Wade's book is a short fairly breezy overview of population genetics, combined with some long overviews of a few previous works speculating on possible grand historical evolutionary changes in human groups like the Jews. Because he takes seriously all the genetics research, unsurprisingly it's controversial.<br/><br/>I was waiting eagerly for it to come out to see whether Wade had put together a synthesis for the layman of all the extraordinary research which has been done over the past 20 years and summarized the flood of genetics research which has been unleashed by the crashing price of genome sequencing. I was disappointed. Wade's book will convince no one: he hits a few highlights, but omits anything like comprehensive coverage of the theoretical and empirical grounds for accepting the <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/three_laws.pdf" title="'Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean', Turkheimer 2000">laws</a> of behavioral genetics (everything is partially heritable & usually highly polygenic, the effects of shared environment like family socioeconomic status is weak, and the rest of variance is unpredictable noise). All such a short overview can do is inflame the debate, when what is needed is to end it.<br/><br/>Wade doesn't describe a century of consistent results from twin studies (it's remarkable that he could write such a book without, as far as I could tell, mentioning Plomin even once!), the missing heritability's problem resolution by GCTA as due to traits being highly polygenic & affected by rare variants, doesn't describe the successes of GWAS (for example, to borrow <a href="http://www.stat115.org/lectures/Harvard_Price_042513_STAT115.pdf">one out-of-date tabulation</a> we now have 23% of Alzheimer's, 3% bipolar, 13% breast cancer, 25% CAD, 13% Crohn's disease, 31% prostate cancer, 13% lupus, 14/28% type I/II diabetes; and <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/rErZm8HUluBbj8xu" title="'Uncovering the Hidden Risk Architecture of the Schizophrenias: Confirmation in Three Independent Genome-Wide Association Studies', Arnedo et al 2014">schizophrenia</a> seem to have recently yielded a bit), and in some cases dramatically understates the state of the art - he confidently predicts that as far as linking genes with intelligence, "that is unlikely to happen anytime soon", because "each of which [genes] has too small an effect to be detectable with present methods", citing <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3498585/" title="Most reported genetic associations with general intelligence are probably false positives" >a well-known paper</a> on the failure of early hits due to small sample sizes, except that at the estimated effect sizes, with reachable sample sizes like 100k SNP samples, the hits were predicted to be detected, and indeed, before <i>A Troublesome Inheritance</i> was even published, the first hits came out and have been replicating well (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3751588/" title="GWAS of 126,559 Individuals Identifies Genetic Variants Associated with Educational Attainment">Rietveld et al 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/38/13790.full.pdf#page=1&view=FitH" title="Common genetic variants associated with cognitive performance identified using the proxy-phenotype method">Rietveld et al 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0100248#close" title="Genetic Variation Associated with Differential Educational Attainment in Adults Has Anticipated Associations with School Performance in Children">Ward et al 2014</a>, <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/fjT7cvDy_E_tMpY7" title="Educational attainment-related loci identified by GWAS are associated with select personality traits and mathematics and language abilities">Zhu et al 2015</a>). Another passage I noted with a raised eyebrow argues that a change in a population's mean of a trait is unimportant since it would be relatively small, which is wrong since that could have a profound impact on the tails of how many members of that population are extremely high or extremely low on that trait, which is something he acknowledges in a later chapter on Jewish intelligence - that their somewhat higher mean intelligence than the surrounding goyim would explain their enormous overrepresentation among geniuses and other elites.

Well, for the most part it seems to be a summary of <i>The 10,000 Year Explosion</i>, Pinker's <i>Better Angels of Our Nature</i>, Clark's <i>Farewell to Alms</i> & <i>The Son Also Rises</i>, Fukuyama's <i>Origins of Political Order</i>, Botticini & Eckstein's <i>The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History</i>, and Cochran's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish_intelligence">Ashkenazi intelligence hypothesis</a>. Wade is interested in the possible different selective pressures on each population as they co-evolve with their institutions and environment, sometimes tending towards domestication, sometimes not. His presentation is not terrible, but I think most readers would be better off simply reading the source books (I have read most of them and they are worth reading in their entirety).<br/><br/>Excerpts:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/CHFzMnv39Y3">ch1</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/hBbQqoqvzxr">ch2</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/XUjsZMBP6Vk">ch3</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/4oB78gHYnA7">ch4</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Uh5RBzffp3z">ch5</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/6FnWKPyBLrk">ch7</a></li><br/><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/3UKZXQnhYgj">ch8-9</a></li><br/></ul>


  *[New Legends](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0312862016&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Greg Bear                        ★★★      1996   2013/12/04   <i>New Legends</i> is an anthology of SF stories picked by Bear with an eye toward the psychological & personal lives of scientists/researchers. I purchased a copy of it to look at the novella "Radiance" by Carter Scholz and compare it with the full novel <i>Radiance</i> for <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance">the annotated ebook of <i>Radiance</i></a> I have been working on for a while. That will be its own review, so I will pass over it for now. An unexpected bonus for me was Gregory Benford's contribution: not a story, but an autobiographical essay <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance#old-legends">"Old Legends"</a> on the real-life background to "Radiance" that he lived through, discussing his physics career, time at LLNL (where "Radiance" is set), experiences with other SF authors in the Reagan-era lobbying for SDI/Star Wars, the <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/1984-berger.pdf" title="The Astounding Incident: The Manhattan Project's Confrontation With Science Fiction">Cartmill incident</a>, his admiration of Edward Teller, etc. Scholz clearly drew on Benford for his novella, and so it was unusually interesting for me.<br/><br/>The collection overall is good, but not great. A number of the stories are too clearly the product of early '90s anxious liberalism and have not aged well since they were written in 1993 or earlier (\~20 years ago), some are half-baked, and some are just bad. A few are very good. They are grouped into thematic sections. To go through them in order (there are many spoilers below):<br/><br/><ul><br/><li> "Elegy", Mary Rosenblum. Good. A scientist working on controlled use of squid neurons to repair human brains and cure trauma like Alzheimer's struggles with guilt about her demented mother, fear her research will fail, and worries that the squid she uses as raw materials may be part of something far greater.</li><br/><li> "A Desperate Calculus", Sterling Blake. Bad. World-trotting scientists struggle to organize a response to a devastating pandemic. Twist ending: the pandemic was engineered to render women sterile, stopping the threat of overpopulation, forcing humanity to dieback and live in harmony with the environment, and the (immune) protagonists were spreading it through their jetsetting, overlaid on a geopolitical forecast of Northern hemisphere vs Southern hemisphere balkanization & resentment. The engineered pandemic conceit is nice but has been done many times before, and the politics are incredibly grating. Even in 1994 it should have been obvious that overpopulation was not going to be an existential threat and that the worst of the environmental problems are often solved by additional economic growth (the Kuznets curve). This story is particularly dated; contemporary writers thinking about using global warming as their threat should consider how much they care about dating themselves.</li><br/><li> "Scenes from a Future Marriage", James Stevens-Arce. Mediocre. An unlucky couple who screw up all their life decisions fail again, and review their choices while contemplating suicide. Set against a vaguely dystopian background. This one did nothing for me as it was so over the top.</li><br/><li> "Coming of Age in Karhide", Ursula K. Le Guin. Great. In an ageless city where every life follows ancient finely-honed patterns, a fearful child grows into its sexual maturity and becomes an adult. This is very much a Le Guin traditionalist story with her trademark gender twist, and it does what it does very well.</li><br/><li> "High Abyss", Gregory Benford. Good. An alien religious war about the physics of the universe, in a universe which is not ours, culminates in victory for the renegade mathematician who led the revolt with his heretical theory that the world is not a line, but another topology. A treacherous counterattack sends the prophet aloft on a hot-air balloon and he realizes that his heresy did not go far enough - that the world was a <i>string</i> embedded in a far grander, far larger, more spherical universe (ours?). He is simultaneously exalted and debased by the epochal discovery of the truth of the Universe. Benford throws you in the hard SF deep-end to figure out the universe (I'm actually reminded a little of <i>The Clockwork Rocket</i> here as a recent example). Does it work? It's hard to say because the story is so short. I'm not sure what the "string" is even supposed to be - a superstring? How does that work with the given system of the world with 'lava' bubbling up in the center of the world? I thought initially the story was being set underseas on a crustal fault, and the lava was literal lava and the cold abyssal waters doomed the people if they tried to leave the long line/ridge, but then "stars" came up and I had to abandon that theory. I'm not entirely satisfied with my interpretation and wish the story had been longer and explained its world a little more.</li><br/><li> "Recording Angel", Paul J. McAuley. Mediocre. In a vastly distant post-human future, a Indian-like city's ancient rhythms are disturbed by a human returning from an eons-long space trip. She leads some sort of revolution. Did nothing for me, as nothing about it seemed important, the world-building failed to explain what was going on, etc.</li><br/><li> "When Strangers Meet", Sonia Orin Lyris. Bad. A mind-controlling alien (the One) celebrates, with its many servants, the festival at the end of its year, culminating in a grand dance to the death (by exhaustion) of its vaguely human-like slaves. Interspersed are occasional comments about interstellar communication with aliens (humans?). This one frankly made little sense to me. There's some repeated lines about the dangers of the servants becoming "too familiar" to the One, but also a line about "strangers bring benefits". The story feels ominous but nothing gels before it abruptly ends with the dance performance and another use of the strangers line. What does it all mean? I have no idea. I can barely figure out what the alien social system is supposed to be (I <i>think</i> it's modeled after eusocial insects), much less any theme or message. This might have worked if Lyris hadn't badly overestimated my ability to understand what she wrote.</li><br/><li> "The Day the Aliens Came", Robert Sheckley. Very bad. Supposedly humorous. A writer nonchalantly accepts employment with an alien tourist, but then suddenly he's shacking up with another alien, and suddenly the couple is having kids and merging into a group organism with other couples and then the story just ends. WTF‽ This badly needed to be rejected or at least, Bear should have rejected it and sent it back to Sheckley with a note saying "where's the second half of this story?"</li><br/><li> "Gnota", Greg Abraham. Mediocre. A mid-future soldier gets hit by an IED due to sentimentality; his heart is to be replaced by a clone of his heart grown inside a genetically-engineered pig. He bonds with the pig.</li><br/><li> "Rorvik's War", Geoffrey A. Landis. Good. A citizen is conscripted into a war against the Russians. He dies in an attack - or maybe he dies another way, and then another. War is hell, and wasteful since the militaries' computers can all simulate the outcome of the battles, except can they really take into account the human factor? Rorvik dies again and again, is taken POW and sent to a Communist re-education camp, until fuzzily he realizes: he's <i>in</i> the computer simulations. He grapples back to reality, and his conscription is over. He returns home with all his limbs, having apparently served his country without any repercussions. But will he psychologically truly recover? I enjoyed this one in part because it undercut my expectations: I was mentally a little bored with yet another war against Russians and thinking it was a little stupid, but then the story justified its choices quite nicely.</li><br/><li> "Radiance", Carter Scholz. Great. See <i>Radiance</i>.</li><br/><li> "Old Legends", Gregory Benford. Great. See opening summary.</li><br/><li> "The Red Blaze Is the Morning", Robert Silverberg. Great. Silverberg turns in one of the best stories in this volume: an old archaeologist, almost out to pasture, strives in his Turkish dig site to make one last extraordinary find justifying his heterodox theory of the origins of human civilization, following the clue of a few out of place artifacts. He is lonely, his body is failing, but his passion to understand the past drives him on in his fruitless digs. Haunted by his continuing failure to find anything at all, he begins hallucinating visions from the end of time, the dying Earth, the ruins of the mightiest civilizations that humanity will one eon give birth to. The visions are sent by his counterpart, one of the last sapient beings left in the ruins after the Gotterdammerung, who makes him an offer: to swap their minds (shades of Lovecraft's scholars), so the being can study the impossibly remote origins of humanity and the protagonist study undreamt-of eras. He refuses of course, and the dig continues to go poorly, he drinks more and more, until finally in the climax, a Turkish official arrives with the shattering truth: the artifacts were planted by a corrupt Turkish official for the express purpose of egging him on and motivating more work at the site. His dig is futile, was always futile, and even the slender evidence he had was meaningless. His theory will not be vindicated. Utterly destroyed by the revelation, he accepts the Faustian bargain and flees into madness - or the future? And awakes at the end of time, with endless ruins to investigate and ponder. This story impressed me as close kin to "Radiance" and showing the dark side of a quest for truth.</li><br/><li> "One", George Alec Effinger. Mediocre. A husband-wife team set out in a spaceship to search for life. As predicted by the Fermi paradox, they fail to find any on thousands of worlds. The wife dies, the protagonist slowly goes insane, and converts to religion as he continues to fail to find life on any planets he surveys. Wholly unconvincing, I thought.</li><br/><li> "Scarecrow", Poul Anderson. Mediocre. An almost Asimovian pastiche, of another husband-wife team whose ship crashes on the chaotic moon Hyperion. They struggle to reach shelter in the installation on the moon, manned by robots, only to discover the robots have, yes, gone insane - or become religious, specifically, having developed a religion focusing on darkness/chaos/bad vs light/order/good. The pair need to prove they follow the light and are not sinister agents of chaos. Based on the wife's brief religious dialogue with the robots, the husband receives inspiration: he proves that they come from the light by teaching the robots about fractals and chaotic equations which nevertheless have a simple beautiful mathematical core. Having proven his theodicy - how a good and orderly god could have created the chaotic Saturn environment - they are accepted by the robots as fellow worshippers and admitted into the base. While I really enjoyed the last page, I level the opposite accusation at this story that I did some of the others: it is far too long, almost all of it could be trimmed out, and some of the characterization is very poor (the wife is wholly unnecessary and IMO is constantly irritating).</li><br/><li> "Wang's Carpets", Greg Egan. Great. I would put this with "Radiance" and "The Red Blaze Is the Morning" as the 3 best stories in this volume. Upload civilization fires off a bunch of copies to remote systems to look for life, in part as a final attempt to find a justification for remaining involved in the real world and pursuing the great scientific project of understanding the universe, rather than enjoying ever more abstracted or refined simulations. They discover an apparently dull giant simple ocean life form based on self-replicating carbohydrate sheets. Egan offers a truly inspired bit of worldbuilding when he suggests the sheets then are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile"><i>Wang tiles</i></a> - which are Turing-complete, surprisingly enough, and so host entire computational civilizations of their own! A wonderfully alien suggestion. This was apparently expanded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_%28novel%29"><i>Diaspora</i></a>, which if it's as good as the short story, is well worth the reading. I'll look for a copy.</li><br/></ul>


  *[A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time, \#14)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0765325950&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                           Robert Jordan                    ★★★      2013   2013/01/09   So. It has come to this. WoT finally ended.<br/><br/>I remember how the wheel of dharma began to turn for me: my mother ran a Girl Scouts troop while I was in middle school, and sometimes they met at a local town rec center. Rather than try to participate, I would sometimes kill time in the lounge reading their old donated paperbacks. One of them was remarkably thick, but the cover looked interesting, and I was hooked by the opening passages: a Tolkien-esque chapter about a young lad heading back to the Shire and haunted by a Ring-wraith. (Not so much the Prologue, which was too mystifying.) I'd read Tolkien by this point, of course, and wondered if it'd be an awful shameful ripoff like *Sword of Shannara*, but I kept reading.<br/><br/>The opening was nifty enough but not gripping, at least until I reached Moiraine's speech to the villagers about Manetheren. I was spellbound and had not been so gripped at least since Tolkien with Gimli's dirge for the dwarves in the Mines of Moria. And the book didn't stop there: there was the creepy interlude at the cursed city of Shadar Logoth, the even more creepy Machin Shin of the Waygates, the unusual Templar/Children of the Light, the intriguing uncertainty about which of the kids was the Main Character (you <i>thought</i> it was Rand, of course, as the major viewpoint, but the dreams kept you uncertain - surely the author wouldn't throw those in if there weren't a good chance the obvious choice wouldn't be picked?), the good troll character who is a scholar rather than a warrior, a Western-samurai militaristic setting a whole city of female magicians, Old Tongue on every other page culminating in no less than the Green Man at the Eye of the World (just one of many nods to real-world things). I was impressed as I read it over the weeks, meeting by meeting, and soon checked out the other 6 or so. This was a long time ago. A very long time ago.<br/><br/>Indeed, WoT could be considered Tolkien turned up. Tolkien had a cast of hundreds? WoT would have a cast of thousands! Tolkien had a few countries going to war against a dark lord? WoT would have dozens of countries and regions! Tolkien had two or three scheming magicians? WoT would have scores of scheming magicians, and they would be split into more than a dozen groups, all scheming. Tolkien had one or two trolls? WoT would have trolls too, all over the place, and they'd be the good kind, peaceful scholar; and Tolkien had a character recording events for a history, well, that's a perfect task for one of the scholar-trolls. Tolkien had a few Ring-wraiths and a big fight against one at the end, well, WoT would have ring-wraiths in every book and they'd be a standard foe (which makes sense given all the magical powers given to every other character: you need to power up the bad guys if you power up the good guys). The Shire would be tainted by evil due to the hero & companions coming from there and eventually have to be led to an uprising? Emond's Field would never fall and would wage epic battle against Padan Fain et al. And so on.<br/><br/>You couldn't say that Wheel of Time had the restrained scholarly English sensibility of LotR, but it packed a punch. If LotR was the novel, WoT was the video game or maybe movie adaptation, with everything dialed up to 11 and an unlimited budget for explosions & exotic locations. And it did this very well in the early books. In that sense, it's an excellent 'Tolkien for teenagers'. (In another sense, reusing the old 'hidden prince' trope of being born to a destiny and with arcane powers, WoT is also good for teens: they've long loved that trope, perhaps because at that age they desperately love the idea of being given a defined role and the (unearned) ability to fill it. This trope is perhaps a bit too narcissistic for adults to enjoy as much, although given how popular <i>Frozen</i> has been and how many people, child or adult, claim to identify with Elsa, I may be wrong here.)<br/><br/>One of the lessons I learned from WoT was learning the hard way why one should avoid in-progress series: the mental suffering and time expended is radically out of proportion to the pleasure. (I am handily applying this lesson now to that *other* endless vast fantasy epic, GRRM. Given my pre-2007 comments that it was entirely possible that Jordan would die before finishing, I wonder how that one will turn out.) Another lesson is that length and a big cast of characters should not be taken as a goal in its own right because you descend into repetition and cliche.<br/><br/>In some sense, Sanderson's AMoL for me succeeds just by existing and giving me closure. I would be happy if it is not as enraging as King's ending to *The Dark Tower*, or as unremittingly awful and a disgrace to all parties involved as Brian Herbert & KJA's work in the Dune universe. Perhaps all the people on Goodreads who are leaving laudatory 5 star reviews without even reading the book and apparently are ignorant of what a "review" is feel the same way - that as long as it's not awful, it deserves 5 stars for giving them closure.<br/><br/>And it's neither enraging nor terribly awful, so I am satisfied.<br/><br/>I share a lot of the complaints I've seen in other reviews. Some characters like Moiraine do nothing interesting; others have compressed endings like Luc/Isam and Padan Fain. Bela dies despite an expectation that she would continue her improbable luck. The body-swapping is unprecedented and confusing, since it apparently is not due to Rand indulging in cosmic powers but a mysterious gray-haired woman who I could not understand after two reads and googling a bit. The resolution of confrontation with the Dark One was clever as far as it went, but it relied on a feature of Callandor I am pretty sure was not mentioned before and I feel a bit deus ex machina-d, although I'm relieved that the general interpretation of Herid Fel's basic point that because of the Wheel, you have to restore the prison to how it was *before* the Bore (rather than patch it again, kill the Dark One, etc) was correct.<br/><br/>There were many great bits. Rand and Matt bragging in one of their last meetings. Lan taking down Damodred (although didn't we see the suicidal maneuver in a previous book...). Min vs spies. Demandred and Graendal make the Forsaken look less incompetent than usual. Thom casually knifing women while composing a poem.<br/><br/>Many bad parts.<br/><br/>The endless grinding battle - by the time I finished the book, I felt as exhausted as if I'd been pushing pikes with Trollocs myself. The worst part was, despite the endless pages of battle, the battles still didn't feel epic or hardfought; they lacked any urgency or real drama. Perhaps WoT just massively over-indulged in battles before, or perhaps the battles were just disconnected - it's a bad thing when you have characters lampshading the triviality of what they're doing and asking 'so why does this matter when the only battle that matters is Rand vs DO?' The battles are weirdly parochial and limited to a few locations. 4 battlefronts is impressive? For the Last Battle, a worldwide struggle against the Shadow? We didn't get so much as one point of view in, I dunno, Seanchan which was supposed to have waged its own epic struggle against Shadowspawn during the original colonization! We don't get Waygates popping open in hundreds of locations, the entire Randland convulsed in thousands of battles... Basically, we didn't see a world at war. We bounced between 4 locations again and again and again until it was an incredible chore to read another page. Last minute rescues are a storytelling device that work only a few times. In a chapter. Before they lose any impact.<br/><br/>Some of the writing seems stiff and clumsy, and I liked Matt less than in the previous book so I suppose that was just an anomaly.<br/><br/>The 'philosophy' bits of the Rand vs DO encounter were seriously juvenile; so Rand overcomes the DO with the Power of Love but then he realizes that to destroy the DO, he would take away Free Will! And just as any idiot could have predicted, he has to leave the DO alone and repair the prison good as new. And of course the DO whines at him and Rand has to lecture him self-righteously... Give me a break. I'm sure that this must have been Jordon's notes, because I remember Sanderson doing better in *Mistborn*.<br/><br/>I suspect people will be identifying loose ends and missed prophecies or Min-visions for years to come. At least we did sorta find out who killed Asmodean.<br/><br/>So now that it is finished, what should I think of WoT? Would I recommend it to a younger version of me? I think I would. In bulk, WoT's flaws are reduced. The repetition fades away like the Homeric epithets filling out lines, and the multi-million word count becomes less intimidating. The awful middle-late books, like possibly the series nadir *Winter's Heart*, lose their severe aggravation when you have all the books in a pile waiting to be read instead of an unknown multi-year wait upon an author who may (and did) die on you. Without years between reads, the plots and characters will be easier to track, and even if one fails to pick up on clues or asides, the resolution will be delivered soon and one can go 'ah!' as one newly appreciates a new thread of the pattern.<br/><br/>But I would accompany it with this caution: <br/><br/>"WoT, in small chunks, is not good. The characters and writing is repetitious, the descriptions pedestrian; few passages will move you with the beauty of strangeness or exoticism that marks the best fantasy. What WoT does is take the 'quantity vs quality' tradeoff, and jam it all the way to 'quantity', to see what happens, and does so more extremely than any other fantasy series I know of. If you want to see 'epic fantasy', with a cast of who knows how many thousands, spread over more countries than you can keep straight, and watch this tapestry evolve over years and millions of words, then you must read WoT. If you want to maximize your enjoyment per word, if you want the heights of what the fantasy genre can deliver in terms of quality, then put away WoT for another day and instead do something like read through chronologically the winners of the Locus & World Fantasy Awards."<br/><br/>There have been worse obituaries for pieces of your childhood.

I immediately subscribed and submitted my preferences:</p><br/><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><br/><li>http://www.buttercupfestival.com/2-120.htm</li><br/><li>http://www.buttercupfestival.com/2-101.htm</li><br/><li>http://www.buttercupfestival.com/2-14.htm</li><br/><li>http://www.buttercupfestival.com/2-5.htm</li><br/><li>http://www.buttercupfestival.com/2-114.htm</li><br/><li>http://www.buttercupfestival.com/2-125.htm</li><br/></ol><br/><p>Luckily, I spoke up quickly enough to get my first choice.</p><br/><p>The Kickstarter succeeded and the printing of the book went through apparently without much issue, so I received my package in early January 2014.</p><br/><p>The original of comic \#120 turns out to be a sheet of stiffish paper about 29.2x20.3 centimeters, much larger than the web image. The image also doesn’t do it justice: the original is actually visibly textured with whiteout, you can see variation in the intensity of black, and between that, the stars in the stream seem to shine a little bit. So I was satisfied and just needed to find a frame for it. I scanned it to have a backup copy:</p><br/><p>https://i.imgur.com/98YSV07.jpg</p><br/><p>I also received:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>“Standing in the Sea” [2011] set of 6 postcards featuring David’s poetry and the fab artwork of Laurie Hastings.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>Hastings’s artwork was interesting but not really in my vein. David’s poetry was decent enough that I copied part of 2 of the better ones; from “Their Daughter”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>“The cooling, still-warm blue<br />of September rolls westward<br />…Their daughter toe-steps among the twizzles<br />of melon vine, which follow<br />everything, seek everything,<br />labouring now and again to fatten a soul<br />sweet and blind.”</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>And from “Pumpkinseeds”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>“…Outside<br />summer tumbles<br />like a slob through the valley.<br />We roll up our sleeves to the shoulder,<br />we dip our children in greeny ponds.<br />It is only for us that catbirds mock cats.<br />It is only for us that pumpkinseeds<br />float in weedy splendour, flecked<br />like whittles of sun.”</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>Not bad. I eventually wound up using the postcards for a prank.</p><br/><p><em>Renaming of the Birds</em> (2013; ISBN 978-0-9927133-0-0) is a 74pg novel with \~56 black-white sketches of birds/landscapes/people as illustrations. (There is one short poem at the end, but it seems they were all split out as the companion pamphlet <em>The Fountain</em> along with unused illustrations.) The Kickstarter for it describes it as</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>…an illustrated storybook about a young clerk who is assigned to rename all the birds in his town. The book is in the form of a journal kept by the clerk, and proceeds through a whole year, as he ventures farther and farther into the woods, looking for new birds to rename. He ends up sleeping outdoors, travelling all around, building a winter den and going a bit crazy. I originally thought of this as a kids’ book and kept the language within hearing of 10 to 12 year-olds, though really it’s a book for all ages, and adults will find plenty to think about. If you’re familiar with my webcomic <em>Buttercup Festival</em> you’ll know the sort of whimsy, humor and outdoorsiness you’ll find in <em>Renaming of the Birds</em>. If you’re not – I hope you’ll find out!</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>This is not inaccurate a summary, but it overemphasizes the ‘renaming’ part: one might think it’s a sort of magical realist novel or more upbeat Kafkaesque novel or an experimental novel, but the renaming part and the new names passes quickly. Which is too bad because I thought it was a nice parody; for example, the letter with the assignment:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><blockquote><br/><p>Special Committee for the Avoidance of Bird Death Unhappiness</p><br/><p>To Whom It Will Concern:</p><br/><p>It has been determined that the recent phenomenon of Bird Death Unhappiness will best be avoided by a process of de-bird-familiarization. We are therefore undertaking to render birds less familiar, and this will be accomplished through the assignment of new bird names.</p><br/><p>The task of bird name reassignment will be passed to the appropriate local agencies, to be staffed at their discretion. Agents should rename every type of bird within their town.</p><br/><p>All necessary forms are enclosed. Agents are to begin immediately.</p><br/><p>Ever Yours,</p><br/><p>SCABDU</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>I had to read that fifteen or twenty times before it began to sound like real words. But the gist of it, I think, is that they wanted me to <em>rename the birds</em>.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>It is Orwellian bureaucratic reasoning that would not be one bit out of place in England. Why not?</p><br/><p>So the protagonist sets about his task, renaming mockingbirds to ‘Yelling Birds’, Crows to Rattles, Gulls to Tattles, Pigeons to Ladyfriends, Mourning Doves to Vinegar Doves, Grackles to Velvet Inkdrops, and runs out. So he sets off to the woods, and of course meets a woman there. In a few more vignettes wandering the woods, he kills time and renames some more birds. He declines to rename swans, and is puzzle by sparrows. It becomes an extended camping trip: the narrator sees some more trees, watches a kestrel kill one, sleeps in trees, and winter comes. He survives the snow by making a lean-to. (No mention of where he gets food initially before learning how to scavenge roots, which was a major concern of <href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201409/the-last-true-hermit?printable=true" title="The Strange & Curious Tale of the Last True Hermit: For nearly thirty years, a phantom haunted the woods of Central Maine">a Maine hermit</a> I read about recently and who I’m reminded strongly of when rereading RotB). After winter, he wanders his way back, eventually returning to his house. Wandering around some more, he re-meets the woman and together they wander out into the woods and watch birds. He still doesn’t know what to rename sparrows to.</p><br/><p>The illustrations are appropriate and well-done.</p><br/><p>The writing is fair enough. It’s not as overripe as much of Troupes’s poetry, and he generally underplays incidents and avoids <em>too</em> much mawkishness and invocations of God. It does indeed feel like a journal of a long camp-out, and Troupes is doubtless taking a lot of material from life. It’s pleasant, but not much beyond that.</p>

As an active user of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_%28software%29">ledger</a> for my personal finances, writer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medici_Bank">WP article on the Medici Bank</a>, & reader of <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/">Nick Szabo</a>, I thought I might find <i>Double Entry</i> interesting.<br/><br/>The book sets up as a morality play, pointing to the many well-known corporate scandals in the 2000s, before quickly going to Ancient Sumeria & the invention of writing for business purposes ('accounting' might be a bit of an anachronism there), a few tantalizing Roman quotes & the possibility of Indian invention (although as with so many other things, the Indian dreamtime makes certainty difficult to reach), and settling down in the 1300s and sketching out Venice's rise with its associated mercantile class, such as Datini, whose well-preserved business documentation is familiar to anyone interested in Renaissance commercial practices.<br/><br/>This sets the scene for Pacioli: Venice's trade throughout the Mediterranean and Adriatic and Black Sea and especially Constantinople, its navy, which Pacioli witnessed as a young mathematician traveling and tutoring. He learned well, returning to Venice in time for the Gutenberg revolution to make financially feasible an enormous encyclopedia laying out the use of indispensable Arabic numerals and, as it happens, double-entry accounting. Along the way, he hung out with Leonardo da Vinci, compiled a book of cool magic tricks like handling molten lead barehanded (apparently featured on <i>Mythbusters</i>), wrote the first book on chess, got that portrait done, and so on. Pacioli turns out to be far more interesting than I would have guessed for a monk known for popularizing something as dull as double-entry!<br/><br/>We get a short introduction to double-entry; I'm not sure how well one would learn double-entry from that chapter if one didn't already have a little experience. (It's not <i>that</i> complex, but it can be tricky deciding what should be added/subtracted from what accounts.) The brevity of this section is a little odd since it is the major theme of the book: you expect a book on the history of accounting to discuss in detail accounting, like a book on physics or any other intellectual topics.<br/><br/>It's also not a very good overview of Renaissance capitalism either: the great fairs appear in one or two sentences, the tricky methods of interest (exploiting exchange rate variations between currencies and geographic variation) are discussed too briefly to clarify, and we don't get a good idea of how banks and trading companies were organized as a series of yearly partnerships (for example, the Medici bank was structured as several affiliated partnerships which dissolved and reformed every year; and this was how the financial state was calculated, and new partners/employees brought on) though later Gleeson-White contrasts the yearly partnership form to the continuous joint-stock corporation form - apparently forgetting that she never really covered the original form.<br/><br/>This leads into the Industrial Revolution. A few examples of the moralizing of good accounting are provided, but not that much. (There seems to be a lot of fertile material in the Netherlands which got omitted, judging from Soll's article <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/06/07/the-vanished-grandeur-accounting/3zcbRBoPDNIryWyNYNMvbO/story.html">"The vanished grandeur of accounting"</a>.) An interesting example of the effect of double-entry is provided by the famed Wedgwood pottery factory, which was staggering under financial problems despite enormous success until Wedgwood got his books in order and figured out where all his money was going. I wish Gleeson-White had provided a dozen examples in that vein: how was double-entry <i>used in real life</i>? The first railway bubble provided the impetus for British wholesale adoption, but I wonder how double-entry related to the Gilded Age in America? Since accounting is subjective in some senses, it would have been interesting to dig into the details of some of the collapses briefly mentioned to see what went into the differing appraisals - for example, I am intrigued by the final line of this quote, but the thread is dropped without any further discussion:<br/><br/><blockquote>In the 1920s the US construction business Kreuger & Toll became one of the largest conglomerates and multinationals imaginable, like Enron seventy years later. After its founder Ivar Kreuger died in 1932, millions of investors discovered the company's financial statements had been falsified over many years. But because of the company's extraordinary organisational complexity, the investigating accountants Price Waterhouse could not determine the exact extent of the fraud and so the investors lost their money. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 revealed the accounts of another titanic company, Insull Utility Investments, to be 'grossly misleading'. Its CEO Samuel Insull was tried for fraud in 1932 and acquitted on all counts. A considerable part of Insull's defence rested on the persuasiveness of the commonsense rationale behind his accounting practices (he had treated stock dividends as income, which was prohibited at the time, but the prosecution was unable to make a clear case against it)-and, by implication, 'the financial nonsense peddled in the conventional accounting wisdom'. The prosecution was left without a case, unable to deny that the accounting rules of the day were controversial and unable to claim that there was any consensus within the accounting profession on the particular rule in question. The Insull case highlighted the contentious and arbitrary nature of corporate accounting, especially regarding valuation and depreciation, issues which are essentially unresolvable and continue to be hotly debated today. Significantly, some of Insull's accounting practices, which then lay outside conventional accounting practice, are now accepted wisdom.</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm concerned because as useful as double-entry is, I don't see a good case for identifying it as a major technology worthy of a book or marketing like 'created modern finance' (the Dutch would seem to have a better claim there); to quote the book:<br/><br/><blockquote>"But detractors argue that a close reading of the historical evidence does not support Sombart's generalisation: in fact the few merchants' books which survive from the 1300s to 1800 indicate the double-entry system was not then widely adopted in practice. As part of his career-long dispute with Sombart, economist Basil Yamey argues that the spirit of capitalism animated numerous prominent Italian mercantile ventures before they adopted Venetian bookkeeping: 'Perhaps it is sufficient to note that the Italian enterprises of the Bardi, Peruzzi, Alberti and Medici cannot be said to have been run less efficiently and "capitalistically" before they had adopted the double-entry system than after they had done so.'"</blockquote><br/><br/>Indeed. The point is made even more strongly, inadvertently, by the emphasis on modern accounting scandals and Buffett's observation that derivatives make a corporation's true financial state nearly unknowable, combined with the observation that the world keeps on ticking and annual global growth continues: if modern financial reporting is so ambiguous and unreliable, doesn't that imply that clear transparent books were never <i>that</i> important?<br/><br/>The book gets weaker as it returns to the original theme of the corruption of capitalism and its focus on internalizing gains while externalizing costs. While it's true that GDP may not be a perfect measure, can we say that it's really that bad? (Is it really plausible that a Big Mac actually costs \$200 when all externalities are priced in?) I recall environmentalist activists making a big deal of Bhutan adopting 'Gross National Happiness', but last I heard, you still want to live in China with its focus on GDP and not impoverished unfree Bhutan (ask the Bhutanese refugees how well things worked out for them). There seems to be little critical consideration of this topic, or of arguments for optimism about the environment from the Kuznets curve (although Kuznets is certainly mentioned often enough) & the cornucopians. One feels that in the attempt to turn a long good article on Pacioli into a short book, some rather weak material got included.


  *[Mathematical People: Profiles and Interviews](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1568813406&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                      Donald J. Albers                 ★★★      2008   2014/10/08   A collection of interviews and occasional professional autobiographies in the 1960s-1980s focusing on mathematicians who worked in the 1920s-1970s or people closely associated with the field in other capacities (Martin Gardner, while describing himself as a journalist, impacted the field majorly through his famed <i>Scientific American</i> columns on recreational mathematics; another interview is with a biographer of Hilbert & Neyman, Constance Reid).<br/><br/>Some of these mathematicians one may well be familiar (Conway, Diaconis, Erdos, Gardner, Graham, Kline, Knuth, Mandelbrot, Pólya, Smullyan, Ulam), but many just made me draw a blank (Birkhoff, Blackwell, Chern, Coxeter, Halmos, Hilton, Kemeny, Lefschetz, Pollak, Rees, Reid, Robbins, Taussky-Todd, Tucker), so there's a wide range from the famous and public intellectuals to the working mathematicians.<br/><br/>The interest of the interviews likewise range: Smullyan's autobiographical essay (extracted from his autobiography, apparently) is stuffed full of hilarious stories and jokes as any reader of his books might expect, Diaconis has an interesting life story in going from a traveling stage magician to a mathematician/statistician who continues to dabble in magic (like Smullyan), Knuth's reminiscences are of interest to any programmer, while Chern's life is an unusual look into what it's like to bring modern mathematics to a place like early Communist China; others are just terribly dull. Another issue is that the more pure mathematicians struggle to describe to interviewers in a short approachable fashion what, exactly, they've accomplished and why it's of interest, while the geometers can at least draw pictures of some sort and the ones who dabble in application and especially statistics have all sorts of immediately-interesting topics to discuss. I admit I got very little out of the pure mathematicians, aside from being a bit amused at the aesthetic prejudices on display as algebraists sniff at analysts who sniff at topologists who sniff at combinatorics and meanwhile I have hardly any idea what those specialties are much less any opinion on their respective merits. It is difficult to maintain an interest in topics you don't know anything about and the discussants can't explain, so a good deal of the book was wasted on me.<br/><br/>Some topics surface repeatedly, to one's surprise: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math">"New Math"</a>, a failed American program to rewrite lower mathematical pedagogy into teaching math in a much more abstract fashion, comes up repeatedly (perhaps because of the striking failure, none of the interviewees are willing to endorse it although Kline spends much time attacking it); the Hungarian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_%28group%29">Martians</a> seem to come up in every other interview as the interviewee either taught or worked with a Hungarian, was inspired by a Hungarian, or <i>was</i> a Hungarian (Von Neumann, Halmos, Pólya, Erdős, Wald, and others), although none of the interviewees seemed to have any good suggestions for why the Martian cluster seems to exist (yes, Hungary was poor and so geniuses there might turn to math preferentially, but then why don't we see similar clusters from other impoverished countries? the Hungarian per capita GDP in the early 1900s is probably equaled or exceeded by scores of countries since and present). Other tendencies in the biographies remind me of similar observations I noted in my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/959222084">review of <i>Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science</i></a> - academia seems to have been infinitely less cutthroat than it is now and many of the subjects seem to almost luck into jobs and positions (Mandelbrot in particular seems to have been a beneficiary as he was able to continue his <i>tertium quid</i> career until fractals became a phenomenon), and in every professional life there is a clear discontinuity at WWII where it seems all of Europe's intelligentsia packed up for America and get sucked into the military-industrial complex for application to complex Cold War topics (the Cold War was particularly good to statistics, as one can see how statistics & probability are mentioned only occasionally pre-WWII but then suddenly everyone is dabbling in it post-WWII; likely the Cold War/WWII influence would be even more obvious if interviewers & interviewees didn't step so gingerly around the topic out of a mix of patriotism & shame, the former exemplified by a mention of the cryptographic work in WWII which the interviewee doesn't describe but assures us has been written up in abstract form for the open literature); people married remarkably young and had children immediately which would be a bit odd in this age of prolonged PhDs & multiple postdocs & 'the two-body problem'.<br/><br/>Other topic don't: computers are surprisingly rarely mentioned, with the exception of one or two discussions of the four-color computer proof, and Kemeny who turn out to have been quite prophetic about computers becoming ordinary tools of scholars & to have been one of the developers of BASIC; a mathematically-inclined layman or technologist will be surprised at the general absence of topics like P=NP or Fermat's last theorem, but of course those problems were only formulated or solved long after most of these interviews were conducted.<br/><br/>And I did like some of the anecdotes related. For example, I learned that the origin of Wald's celebrated frequentist sequential analysis came from an incident which for all the world sounds like <i>Bayesian</i> reasoning: "These two men were puzzled because a Navy captain with whom they had discussed the problem of destructive sampling of munitions had said that he didn’t see why he had to destroy so much of the evidence—that there ought to be a way whereby, after a while, an experimenter, like a savvy captain, would know that this was a good batch or a bad one and stop sampling...Since they were unable to get anywhere with it because it required very special mathematical skills, they took it to an outstanding mathematical statistician who was associated with them—Abraham Wald, an émigré from Hitler’s He was intrigued by the problem and solved it by developing a new technique in statistics that is now one of great importance: sequential analysis."<br/><br/>Active mathematicians may find these old interviews of great interest, but I think most people would be better off reading just a few of them: Diaconis, Knuth, Smullyan, Pólya, the 2 Gardner articles, Conway, Chern, Kemeny, Kline, and Mandelbrot (in no particular order).


  *[Pirate Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0765318784&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Gene Wolfe                       ★★★      2007   2012/11/24   (This review is copied from an <a href="http://lists.urth.net/pipermail/urth-urth.net/2012-November/027732.html">email sent to the Gene Wolfe mailing list</a>.)<br/><br/>Quick read, reasonably entertaining. Sadly, I find myself even less interested than *The Sorcerer's House* in figuring out the secret - but I am more interested, and I enjoyed *Pirate Freedom* more, than *An Evil Guest*. Faint praise, perhaps. Reading through the old email threads to see what I missed, I'm not sure about some of the ideas floating around.<br/><br/>First, where's this stuff about him being cloned coming from? The one bit of evidence I've seen is a quote to the effect that "my father made me"; I can't find this in my *Pirate Freedom* EPUB (but FBReader seems to have buggy search so this may not count). But at face value, this seems completely unconvincing to me: he's a *Mafia* guy! All "my father made me" means is that he's a "made man", as one would expect of the son of a big Mafia figure. Chris even says at one point to a new pirate something to the effect 'now you're a made man'. Presumably no one thinks Chris just zapped him with some tailored RNA viruses... "Half-human monster" is more promising, but in context, there's no mention of simply human: "The artists of the Middle Ages painted allegories, we say. What really happened was that they saw more clearly than we do, and painted what they saw - angels and devils, beasts, and half-human monsters like me." The artists were painting clones? Or is this just more Christian thought a la Pope? The best line is "I am taller than most people - my father told me once he got me engineered that way - and I was taller than he was by quite a bit." but height has been known to be heritable since Galton and a fair number of genes & SNPs have already been identified responsible for variance (eg. <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n7/abs/ng.608.html">\~50% from SNPs</a>), so even simple embryo selection (make multiple embryos, sequence the genomes of each, implant the best-scoring one) would work for that. <br/><br/>Second, there's something really weird about the lack of attention paid to the timeslips. Chris doesn't even explicitly mention anything about time travel until like pg 80 where he says it just sank in (?!!?!), and the implication is that the timeslip happened long before he left for the entire monastery: the enrolled kids are, after the closure of the school is announced, implied to be different from the previous kids, and at some point Chris notices no one has wristwatches. Now, this is the same Chris who after wandering around colonial age Cuba and sailing ships still hasn't noticed what time period he is in, so the safe assumption is that the wristwatches disappeared when the school closed. So the entire monastery has been timeslipped for many years, and we are told that some of the monks go out to hear confessions each week, so the timeslip could not have gone unnoticed for more than a week at worst. So what's going on here with the monastery? The lack of contact is curious, as Chris points out and as is emphasized when we learn that Chris thinks his house is so close that he'll just walk there - he didn't sneak out at any point, or have a vacation or break? (His father can't visit him, but nothing is said of Chris visiting his father.)<br/><br/>His obliviousness and rationalizations are supposedly not that: he claims to pump for information the farmer he meets with the horse, but why didn't he just turn around and go back to the monastery and ask 'hey guys - what *happened*?' He also then rationalizes blatantly: "And it was not there. I decided then that there were two Havanas, or maybe the city had changed its name and this little town had taken it over." Sure, Chris. Sure. That's totally plausible.<br/><br/>Having read a bunch of theories on the ML, I can't say any of them seem especially plausible. No one has a good explanation of Jaime's self-immolation or disappearance, Valentin & dog's murder, the apparent foreknowledge of Lesage, Chris's father (if he is a later Chris, why is he much shorter than his 'son'?) or the monastery's behavior. Nothing that ties them all together. It's a little frustrating, since once the various points are identified it feels like there should be an obvious answer.<br/><br/>I feel a little like after reading *The Sorcerer's House*or *An Evil Guest* here: by the end we've identified what the solution ought to look like (another time traveler acting at various points in the story / Bax killing his twin and usurping his identity / Cassie going to Woldercon and maybe time-traveling herself), but we don't know how to go beyond that and make the whole thing fall into a satisfying whole (who and how and why / how the letters were mistakenly or deliberately rearranged and the deceptions before the final deception-letter / what Cassie actually did).<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>On a side note, the speech about the many Church sex abuse scandals is disgusting. I don't take this as Wolfe deliberately giving us evidence of Chris being a depraved monster, it reads too sincerely and is consistent with the increasingly conservative crankery I've documented elsewhere (although I fully expect someone to reply saying 'no, don't confuse the text with the author, let's interpret it as charitably as possible', just like they did with the <a href="http://lists.urth.net/pipermail/urth-urth.net/2012-July/027396.html"><i>non</i>fiction predictions by Wolfe</a> I posted); the lead-up to his speech is itself misleading and slanted, completely ignoring the central enabling coverup role the Church played for decades upon end. There is no reason to not mention the Church's role, since the Bishop is not otherwise portrayed sympathetically and mentioning it would both be factually accurate and continue characterizing the Bishop... The setup is also, shall we say, curious for making the victims adolescents and not younger still as they so often were. It's also a little strange that Wolfe expects the 'Communists to fall'. Even when this was being written, Cuba's government had been substantially liberalizing and privatizing. There's pretty much no reason to expect them to 'fall' as opposed to follow a gradual transition to being, like China, Communist in name-only.

Part of the problem is the shadow of the Holocaust lingering over many of the poems: an event too awesome and sublime to reduce to words, seemingly reducing Celan to slapping down words and fractured lines in frustration and despair, and not a little guilt, circling around the themes again and again (reminding me of Wittgenstein's famous introduction to <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>).<br/><br/>That said, a few of the poems or parts of the poems worked for me - not just the famous <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~lsmithg/deathfugue.html">"Fugue of Death"</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Fugue">WP</a>) but several of the others. In poetry, a few gems is enough, because they stay with one in a way that prose rarely does, and so I forgive Celan for the poems I did not like and myself for the poems I did not get. Some excerpts:<br/><br/>"Aspen Tree...", pg24:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Aspen tree, your leaves glance white into the dark. / My mother's hair was never white. / Dandelion, so green is the Ukraine. / My yellow-haired mother did not come home. / Rain cloud, above the well do you hover? / My quiet mother weeps for everyone. / Round star, you wind the golden loop. / My mother's heart was ripped by lead. / Oaken door, who lifted you off your hinges? / My gentle mother cannot return."</blockquote><br/><br/>"Corona", p32:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Autumn eats its leaf out of my hand: we are friends. / From the nuts we shell time and we teach it to walk: / then time returns to the shell."</blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>"...We stand by the window embracing, and people look / up from the street: / it is time they knew! / It is time the stone made an effort to flower, / time unrest had a beating heart. / It is time it were time. / It is time."</blockquote><br/><br/>"Fugue of Death", pg33:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Black milk of daybreak we drink it at nightfall / we drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at night / drink it and drink it / we are digging a grave in the sky it is ample to lie there / A man in the house he plays with the serpents he writes / he writes when the night falls to Germany your golden / hair Margarete / he writes it and walks from the house the stars glitter / he whistles his dogs up / he whistles his Jews out and orders a grave to be dug in / the earth / he commands us strike up for the dance / Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night / we drink in the mornings at noon we drink you at / nightfall / drink you and drink you / A man in the house he plays with the serpents he writes / he writes when the night falls to Germany your golden / hair Margarete / Your ashen hair Shulamith we are digging a grave in the / sky it is ample to lie there..."</blockquote><br/><br/>"Thread Suns", pg83:<br/><br/><blockquote>"...there are / still songs to be sung on the other side / of mankind."</blockquote><br/><br/>"I Hear that the Axe has Flowered", pg106:<br/><br/><blockquote>"I hear that the axe has flowered, / I hear that the place can't be named, / I hear that the bread which looks at him / heals the hanged man, / the bread baked for him by his wife, / I hear that they call life / our only refuge."</blockquote><br/><br/>Ironically, the reason I looked up Celan in the first place was a Japanese novella (a doujin for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou</a>), <a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Iyokan">Iyokan</a> & Surrounded By Enemies's <a href="http://gallery.gensokyo.org/archive/Iyokan_and_Surrounded_by_Enemies_-_Dream_and_Reality.zip"><i>Dream and Reality</i></a>, included as a running theme quotes from Celan's <i>From Threshold to Threshold</i> (perhaps because <a href="http://www.thewhitereview.org/features/celan-reads-japanese/" title="'Celan Reads Japanese', Susan Bernofsky (tr.), Yoko Tawada (2013)">Celan's poems in Japanese bring out the repeated themes</a> of gates/thresholds/transitions, which complements the plot of the novella & a <a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Yukari_Yakumo">key character</a>). I had been particularly struck by the poem "The Guest" from <i>Threshold</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote>"Long before nightfall / someone who exchanged greetings with darkness / comes to spend the night with you. / Long before daylight / he wakes / and, before leaving, kindles a sleep, / a sleep echoing with footsteps: / you hear him going off, measuring distances, / and you throw your soul / after him."</blockquote><br/><br/>And since <i>Selected Poems</i> was available but <i>Threshold</i> was not, I downloaded it to read... and "The Guest" was not in it.


  *[Before the Storm (Star Wars: The Black Fleet Crisis, \#1)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0553572733&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                         Michael P. Kube-McDowell         ★★★      1996                As a kid collecting EU novels and stories, I was always puzzled by *The Black Fleet Crisis* trilogy. It was wildly different in tone and subject matter from most of the EU, I didn't know whether I hated it or loved it, and it seemed to have been largely ignored by the rest of the EU (ever see the Yevetha or Black Sword Command or the White Current mentioned elsewhere?). This ignoring has happened for a number of other books like the *Dark Empire* comics or *Crystal Star*, but usually for good reasons: *Dark Empire* was so over-the-top and gothic that to take it seriously would undermine many other stories and so it's usually name-checked briefly, if that, and ignored, while *Crystal Star* was just so terrible it can be ignored. Neither of these seem especially applicable, though, so I didn't know what to think.<br/><br/>Having reread the trilogy now, I think I understand it better. It's essentially a Weber/Drake/Clancy-style military or mil-sf novel, which happens to be set in the EU and feature 2 distracting large subplots. From the great opening Fifth Fleet exercise to the equally great small subplot of discovering the Black Sword records (I'm nerdy enough to really like that, and also the various library/research issues in the Lando subplot) to the excellent finish, that's what it really is.<br/><br/>The problem is in large part the non-Yevethan subplots:<br/><br/>1. there's a reasonably interesting first-contact story using Lando which keeps distracting from the real story and which has absolutely no relevance to the other 2 subplots and is completely unnecessary. (Another reviewer comments that it would fit nicely as a stand-alone story like the pulpy *Han Solo Adventures*; I agree, and actually there were multiple *Lando Calrissian Adventures*, so even more reason...)<br/>2. The subplot for Luke has more justification than Lando, but is still problematic for how sheerly boring and pointless it is. The ultimate justification seems to be the White Current assistance in the final battle and revelation of how they had been working against the Yevetha all along, but this is not much of a justification. It's probably just as well, since any real info about Luke's mother would have been rendered moot by the prequels (and I wonder if that's why the ending *had* to be so disappointing?). The positive side is that in some respects, this subplot seems to anticipate how a lot of later writers would handle Luke - so perhaps we should not criticize Luke's hermetical ways and musings. (Some of the resemblances to the Yuuzhan Vong/New Jedi Order story-arcs are striking, although I hated them enough that I stopped reading the EU after they started coming out.) Certainly he serves as a vehicle for some interesting bits like reflecting on the death toll of the first Death Star (although the Imperial Museum in *Wedge's Gamble* is still a far better scene).<br/><br/>(One missed opportunity is Drayson; since Drayson is a key player in the major arc, and a key player in the start and end of Lando's arc, the trilogy missed a chance to make an interesting and subtle move: have Drayson be the topic of the trilogy! It would examine his methods, choices, and beliefs as contrasted against those he manipulates and serves. Most people would not appreciate this subtlety, but that only makes it mirror the life of its subject all the more. But he plays no role in Luke's subplot, so the interpretation fails. Too bad. The spy novel aspects were a major reason why Zahn's trilogy was, and probably still remains, the greatest EU series.)<br/><br/>The criticism of Leia in the trilogy is, I think, off-base. A good character is not a omni-perfect automaton who never makes mistakes; Leia needs to make mistakes, and this depicts one of them. Calling that 'bad characterization' is just fanboyism. I am reminded of a foreword to one of the character encyclopedias which enthused, "Check it out, Leia never misses [in *A New Hope*]". I did. She does, several times.


  *[Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=046502324X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                        Jim Manzi                        ★★★      2012   2013/01/25   Speaking as a die-hard believer in the value of randomization and meta-analysis, I'm not entirely sure how much I got from this book other than some useful assertions and interesting claims. To go through it roughly in order:<br/><br/>1. the first few chapters are a serviceable philosophy of science primer. We get discussion of how the Scientific Revolution was a break, we get some Popper and falsificationism, and as a very important correction, some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis">Duhem-Quine</a>; we get some cultural and vocation material, and discussion of the value of prediction even in non-experimental sciences. Chapter 6 is a bit of a waste as Manzi makes the standard criticism of frequentism that the basic ideal - probability as the limit of some particular set of events - is extremely imprecise since it gives absolutely no guide as to *which* set of events, since you can choose arbitrarily complicated events, but he does so on his own terms and without any reference to competing paradigms such as the many flavors of Bayesianism.<br/>2. then we get into genuinely important material on the development of RCTs (he uses the term "RFT", which I find silly). Personally, I could wish for a whole book on the gradual development and refinement, and many more examples of the superiority of RCTs to other approaches; his summaries of things like the US social program experiments is short and in many ways inferior to, say, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/docs/1987-rossi" title="The Iron Law Of Evaluation And Other Metallic Rules, Rossi 1987">Rossi's "metallic laws"</a>. ch9's example analyses read like columns folded into the chapter, but I still enjoyed them as fun examples of critical thinking and how analyses can reach any goal.<br/>3. with ch10 we finally get into Manzi's own career. This section is... weirdly lacking in many examples, even though it's the section where you would expect Manzi to just lay the smack down with countless scores of anecdotes and stories and statistics about how experimentation is the *ne plus ultra* of epistemology and exactly how much money it made all these corporations. There's a few, like Capital One and some Internet companies, but it is not very thematically separate from point \#2.<br/>4. he issues some policy recommendations. Hard to argue with some of them: why not let in some immigrants as part of randomized experiments? It can hardly be worse than the current system. Fairly anodyne.<br/><br/>So overall good, and maybe great for people who aren't familiar with the topics. But I think in general if I wanted a layman to appreciate statistics and its pitfalls and experiments, I might actually be better off giving them Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* (although they're not totally comparable, of course).<br/><br/>People seem impressed by his Hayekian libertarian arguments using genetic algorithms as arguments. I don't think they're as well supported as they may seem. Just to name the obvious, society has changed massively over short time-spans, corporate mortality is astonishingly high, corporations do not replicate with high fidelity ("corporate culture" is fragile) etc; evolution, as it happens, can only filter out <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16152.long" title="'Protein stability imposes limits on organism complexity and speed of molecular evolution', Zeldovich et al 2007">so many</a> <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002609" title="'Mutation Induced Extinction in Finite Populations: Lethal Mutagenesis and Lethal Isolation', Wylie & Shakhnovich 2012">mutations</a> per generation so past a certain point, a genome just decays. This, along with <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/l6/no_evolutions_for_corporations_or_nanodevices/" title=" No Evolutions for Corporations or Nanodevices">other considerations</a>, strongly suggests that corporate 'evolution' is nothing but a poetic metaphor.


  *[Game Programming Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1430231505&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Robert Nystrom                   ★★★      2011   2014/05/18   (I read the <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">online version</a>.)<br/><br/>This book follows the standard pattern for design pattern books: short chapters on each particular style, with definition, pros & cons, simple pedagogic example, comparisons with other design patterns, and possibly some discussion of real-world implementations & game engines. I haven't heard of any other place where one could find this sort of game-oriented programming design advice, and in that respect, this book is unrivaled.<br/><br/>While far from encyclopedic, the chosen design patterns all seem like reasonable choices for video game programmers: there are some architectural ones like <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> & <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html">Singleton</a> which everyone needs to know, and then a good helping of high-performance or game-specific patterns (eg. <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html">Data Locality</a>/<a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html">Object Pool</a>/<a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/dirty-flag.html">Dirty Bit</a> & <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html">Double Buffer</a>/<a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">Game Loop</a>/<a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/spatial-partition.html">Spatial Partition</a>, respectively), as well as a few fairly exotic patterns which often show up in games but not that many other areas (for example, <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html">Byte Code</a> shows up in a lot of games to support modding, but you'll otherwise spot such things only in a few extremely-extensible applications like text editors or programming languages).<br/><br/>The actual chapters are surprisingly brief (from my non-game-programming perspective, anyway), and come across more as unusually long blog posts than meaty book chapters. Nystrom mentions several times he was trying for brevity, but I would say he's taken simplicity to simplemindedness. I would have liked to see more of everything: more examples, more real-world applications, more benchmarks, more comparisons to other languages (<i>especially</i> to higher-level languages like Python/JavaScript/Haskell, which as hardware resources increase, game programmers will increasingly use; us Haskellers say that design patterns are simply flaws in the language, and I'm curious how much of Nystrom's writing is simply due to working around C and Java issues).<br/><br/>The web presentation is in standard 2.0-style: big font, lots of whitespace. Not too bad for reading, although the sidebar notes were annoying since a lot of them would have been better off incorporated into the text or simply axed, and their relation to the text could be very confusing if there were 2 or 3 on the same page. The web presentation also omits a major advantage of being online: <i>comments</i>! I started reading the site solely because I saw one of the chapters submitted to Hacker News & found it interesting. By a quick count, there's <a href="http://hn.algolia.com/#!/story/forever/prefix/0/gameprogrammingpatterns.com">18 relevant discussions on Hacker News</a> and another <a href="http://www.reddit.com/domain/gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">37 on Reddit</a>, yet someone reading it has no idea. There were many interesting comments and suggestions in those submissions, why not excerpt the best? Or at least link them at the end of each chapter as a "further reading" or something?


  *[The Dark Side of the Enlightenment: Wizards, Alchemists, and Spiritual Seekers in the Age of Reason](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0393079465&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                               John V. Fleming                  ★★★      2013   2013/08/09   The title might lead one to believe that Fleming is trying to show an inherent duality to science and the Enlightenment in general - its reliance on irrational methods or its oppression or inherent contradictions, say, perhaps an updated (and more factual) Foucault. But while it's a clever play on words, <i>The Dark Side of the Enlightenment</i> boils down to some short biographies of minor figures in Europe: the obscure English faith healer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine_Greatrakes">Valentine Greatrakes</a>, the French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsionnaires_of_Saint-M%C3%A9dard">Jansenists</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism#The_Rosicrucian_Enlightenment">Rosicrucians</a>, the Freemasons, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Cagliostro">Cagliostro</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_von_Kr%C3%BCdener">Julie de Kruedener</a>. If one looks for any sort of demonstration of a duality to the Enlightenment, one will be disappointed, as all the examples seem amply explained by simply pointing out that alchemists and religious types and fraudsters have always existed, and the case studies simply show that the Enlightenment did not sweep them away instantaneously, lock stock and barrel; one is surprised to note Fleming's lack of emphasis on the more famous examples of the coexistence of religion & science, like Isaac Newton. Perhaps this is to ascribe a failure at goals that Fleming never aimed at, but regardless none of the sections are particularly compelling: while the Rosicrucian and Freemason sections seem like reasonable overviews of their subjects for people who don't know anything about the topic, Greatrakes and Kruedener left me completely bored and wondering why Fleming considered them interesting enough to write a good chunk of a book on them summarizing other people's books on them, and the Cagliostro section seems rather apologetic (although I have only seen passing references to Cagliostro before and know little about him).<br/><br/>Fleming's medievalist traits show in his resentment for the low modern opinion of the Dark Ages, which is a little amusing, and his predilection for using very old and obscure books as sources. But this is the cause of the best aspect of this book: Fleming's genuine appreciation that even in the Enlightenment, a great many people thought very differently than we do today, centuries later in a completely transformed age, and his attempt to lay out the forgotten background and bring home the difference in consciousness. For example, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/LEW7iWpd4a9">Fleming points out the absurdity</a> of claiming that Milton either subconsciously or consciously wrote <i>Paradise Lost</i> with the Devil as admirable, given the intense religious convictions of that age and Milton's own strong beliefs, and he does a credible job of conveying how so many Europeans and Catholics could seriously and factually believe that Napoleon Bonaparte was the literal Anti-Christ foretold by John in <i>Revelations</i> who would usher in the end of the world and sketching the <i>gematria</i>-based arguments Christian occultists concocted to 'prove' this. Getting in the "mind" of past ages is always hard, and I appreciate any author who gives me a little insight, even if much of the rest of his book left me feeling like I was wasting my time.


  *[Echopraxia](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=076532802X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Peter Watts                      ★★★      2014   2014/08/15   We've been waiting for this since <a href="http://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm"><i>Blindsight</i></a> came out in 2006 and blew away all its readers. It's been a long wait and those who read <a href="http://www.rifters.com/crawl/">Watt's blog</a> and are familiar with his many travails (from a fight with the US federal government to flesh-eating bacteria) will understand the long wait. Was it worthwhile?<br/><br/>Not really. <i>Echopraxia</i> is a short fast read (\~3-4h) which largely expands on the ideas that <i>B</i> introduced: the concept of new apex predators, vampires; the minimal value of consciousness and what non-conscious upgrades of the brain like the Bicamerals could do with the horsepower; hyper-advanced aliens; and subconscious manipulation. Watts adds in scientific 'zombies', but the idea never really goes anywhere - Watts's side-story <a href="http://www.tor.com/stories/2014/07/the-colonel-peter-watts">"The Colonel"</a> is in some respects more interesting than the novel, and fleshes out the major character The Colonel in a way the novel never really does. (Although the novel at least does raise interesting questions about whether Siri Keeton really escaped alive in <i>B</i>, to recontextualize it - perhaps we're simply reading alien propaganda!) The Bicamerals themselves are something of a disappointment compared to the invention of the Scramblers or vampires. The plot moves on rails from the biologist in the desert to the sun back to the desert, and likely <i>B</i> readers will see coming the major plot twists with the alien & vampire (it's almost identical). Some potentially intriguing ideas go unexplored; for example, the spider/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_%28spider%29#Hunting_techniques">"eight-legged cat"</a> suggestion is quite interesting, but the alien fungus winds up not doing anything beyond what a more normal version of intelligence would do and so it doesn't illustrate the idea of a timesharing slow-but-powerful intelligence. The ending is opaque and knotty, but I think with some thought and review of terminology it becomes clear: the Bicamerals and emergent AIs have completed their plan in which the hijacked fungus is incubated in the protagonist to upgrade baseline humans to vampire-like entities (sans the vampire weaknesses and without consciousness), which will be able to go toe to toe with the God-like alien invader.<br/><br/>So, not a waste of time and probably pretty impressive to people unacquainted with Watts, but below <i>B</i>, some of the Rifter books, and the better short stories. I suggest reading <i>B</i>, then "The Colonel", then <i>Echopraxia</i>.


  *[空ろの箱と零のマリア 1 [Utsuro No Hako To Zero No Maria 1]](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=4048674617&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                        Eiji Mikage                      ★★★      2009   2014/10/23   (55k words, \~3-4 hour read; read the <a href="http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Utsuro_no_Hako:Volume1">Baka-Tsuki translation</a>.) Time loop mystery.<br/><br/>Those familiar with novel/light-novel series like <i>Hyouka</i> or <i>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</i> (particularly "Endless Eight") will be at home here: yes, there's a Japanese high school classroom, yes there will be a beautiful long-haired girl who interacts with the narrator, yes there will be a silent mousy short-haired girl who looks an awful lot like Rei Ayanami/Yuki Nagato in it who is inexplicably popular with the protagonist & readers, yes there will be a goofball sidekick. But the core of <i>Hakomari</i> is not tired romcom tropes, but rather a somewhat intelligent exploration of time-loops/Groundhog Days: besides the obvious like being able to acquire many skills and 'predict the future', how would you detect the center of such a time-loop and escape? What happens to people over many loops? Perfect time loops are too boring since by definition they cannot change, so what kinds of imperfect time loops are there? Are the 'awake' people really as powerful as they seem, or might the loopers be powerful in some ways themselves, as they can keep doing the same thing indefinitely and can be guaranteed to do so?<br/><br/>The answer to each question may seem to be pretty obvious, but Mikage lets the reader infer an answer and then yanks it away several times, using reasoning that would not be out of place in <i>Death Note</i> or <i>Hyouka</i>, using the out-of-order chapters to, like <i>Memento</i>, maintain suspense and mimick forgetting - mysteries are often as much about figuring out why something happened in the past as what happened in the past. (In this respect, it's a trickier exercise than "Endless Eight", where there's multiple bits of time-travel but they're all straightforward to understand.) By the end, it seems all mysteries have been tidily resolved, and the answers are good.<br/><br/>The riddle aspect works well, but the characters and setting otherwise leave me unmoved. The writing is unremarkable, setting is arbitrary, the characters are (as already indicated) stereotypes, and the ending is both a partial copout in averting a death which had been giving it pathos/depath and also a blatant gimmick for continuing to write the series if the first one sold well enough (which given there's 6 of them now, it must've). The mystery part is fun, but like <i>Primer</i> it's too lacking in the other departments to be more than good.


  *[A Confederacy of Dunces](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0802130208&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                           John Kennedy Toole               ★★★      1994   2013/03/13   It's hard to know what to make of this... I've rarely read a book where the main protagonists inspires such disgust in me - even for a picaresque, the main character Ignatius is extreme. It is as if Toole read Cleckley's *Mask of Sanity* and a psychology textbook, and said to himself, "how can I make the most offensive moronic character which mashes up the traits of both psychopaths and autists?" and then wrote a novel on it in which the protagonist's countless evil actions, glib lies, narcissism, ignorance, sloth, leeching, and other flaws finally brought down an appropriate punishment - only to rescue him at the last moment for further adventures.<br/><br/>In particular, I'm not bothered that Ignatius pretends to be a medievalist Catholic. I'm bothered that as far as I can tell, Toole seems to genuinely try to present Ignatius as educated and learned and with a worldview (and reading the reviews here, it seems that most people do indeed take this for granted). The problem is, Toole fails. Utterly. In the entire book, Ignatius's learning is displayed solely as repeated surface allusions to Boethius and Hroswitha, and a few other dropped names, and never anything of substance. Someone who read Wikipedia on Boethius and Hroswitha would know more than Ignatius does, and is probably literate enough to spot Ignatius (and by extension, Toole's) failures, like writing 'gyro' where they were trying to make an allusion to Yeats's 'gyre' (way to mess up an allusion to only one of the most famous poems ever!).<br/><br/>So, with the complete failure of Ignatius to offer any sort of Catholicly-grounded interesting critique or reflection on society (as a good picaresque is *supposed to*!), we're left with the evocation of New Orleans (seems good enough, although I don't know enough about New Orleans to really judge), the humorous value of each set piece (overall, low. Jeeves this is not.), and the final convergence of plot threads at the bar (a decent enough denouement but still leaves the first 150 pages a drag).<br/><br/>Is that enough to make it a masterpiece? I should think not. Indeed, *A Confederacy of Dunces* overall stands in stark contrast to Gene Wolfe or R.A. Lafferty's better novels.


  *[Bitter Seeds (The Milkweed Triptych, \#1)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0765321505&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                         Ian Tregillis                    ★★★      2010   2013/03/20   I loved Stross's "A Colder War", and enjoyed Powers's *Declare* and *Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell*, so this was right up my alley. I enjoyed the concept and a few touches like the Thule Society, and don't regret reading it: taking blood sacrifice seriously in a "beware while fighting monsters" makes for a gradually creeping sense of doom which is fitting, and I was impressed to see the old medieval debate over the language of infants resurrected and then taken to the max, which was a real bit of esoterica. The logical conclusion, a British program into Enochian, is a nasty enough conclusion that it convinced me to keep reading the series.<br/><br/>Downsides: the repeated use of raven sections is blunt; Gretel's character is even blunter, we're told almost on sight that "she sees the future and is manipulating everyone" and this is ground in ad nauseam, while subtlety would've worked better (maybe *1* hint at the beginning and then a revelation at the end for the inattentive reader - but we get what must be dozens instead); Nazi Germany is a total caricature; while sometimes the descriptions of places or events are excellent (like the opening), characters can be pretty wooden and I feel like Marsh is made to punch people to move the plot along (eg. to get himself fired, and then to ignore Will and not ask the sane thing like 'why would you suggest something so horrible as an abortion when you know how much losing our child hurt us?'). The alt history is a little crude and lacking in details: in contrast to *Declare* or "A Colder War", which wove in and rewrote all sorts of historical tidbits (some extremely obscure, in *Declare*), *Bitter Seeds* only does big brushstrokes - tanks going through the Ardennes, bad winter weather in Russia, a failure of a hypothetical Operation Sea Lion - and it omits all sorts of historical backgrounds that could've enriched it (Nazi occultism is a bizarre subject which is surprisingly underused by Tregillis; someone should've given him a copy of *Morning of the Magicians* or something). Hopefully he'll weave a more intricate tapestry for the Cold War books; at least, I'll be quite disappointed if James Jesus Angleton doesn't make some appearances.


  *[Voyage of the Beagle](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=014043268X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Charles Darwin                   ★★★      1989   2012/12/14   Frequently exceedingly dry and of no interest except to naturalists, and probably not always them either: Darwin's voyage was so long ago that much of his information and speculation is simply outdated (his talk of 'miasmas' is one instance where later information makes his material of purely historical interest).<br/><br/>If one is reading it for background on evolution and *Origin of Species*, one will be disappointed: there are a handful of lines in the main part of the work which may be taken as prefiguring or groping towards evolution, and then there's some speculation in the surprisingly short Galapagos section (I suspect he spends as much time describing the gauchos' methods of horsemanship and dealing with cattle as he does on all of the Galapagos material!). In general, the 'pacing' is quite odd: reams of material on South America, some pages on the Galapagos, a dash to New Zealand & Australia, a long section on islands and 'cacao-nuts' (coconuts), a mini-monograph on coral atolls, and the book abruptly ends.<br/><br/>Which is not to say he doesn't occasionally drop in interesting or acute observations, for he does. (The shepherd-dog of South America quite took my fancy, for example.) They are just rare welcome morsels in the general desert of this door-stopper. If I had to recommend it to my past self, I would tell him to skip the bulk but to read the Tierra del Fuego sections where the events are both interesting and evocative of the long uncivilized past of man (and perhaps his future), the Galapagos section for its substantial historical interest, and maybe the brief conclusion.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>My National Geographic anniversary edition is substantially lacking in additional material; there is surprisingly little about its reception, what contributions it made, where it was prescient and where it was wrong (disturbing, since one doesn't know what mistakes, misimpressions, outdated information, plausible yet wrong speculation, etc. one might be absorbing over the 400+ pages). As well, Darwin's original illustrations would benefit mightily from additional material like color photographs and maps.


  *[Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=030795191X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                               Daniel Domscheit-Berg            ★★★      2011   2011/11/08   I give it 3 stars solely because it is a unique primary source about WikiLeaks; if this was not from a principal player, it would not be worth reading as it is shallow incomplete garbage.<br/><br/>Negatives: the writing is absolutely atrocious, although I don't know if this is due to the translation from the German or whether the co-author journalist screwed it all up. <br/><br/>And Domscheit comes off in some passages as too ignorant to even understand Assange's beliefs (for example, I seem to recall that there was an irritating passage where Domscheit mocks Assange's use of red light to help his sleep - even though this is standard chronobiology, that blue light influences melatonin secretion to retard the sleep cycle and keep one awake!). One is strongly reminded of Russell's famous description of Xenophon's writings on Socrates: "A stupid man's report of what a clever man says is never accurate, because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something that he can understand. I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than by a friend innocent of philosophy." Which is not to say that Domscheit's portrait of Assange as a megalomaniac asshole is wrong, because from all the other coverage of him, it's clear there's a lot of truth to this portrayal.<br/><br/>Domscheit's personal failings are only highlighted by the since-complete & unmitigated failure of his 'OpenLeaks' project.<br/><br/>It's also bizarrely lacking in technical details, which is the one part one would hope a supposed geek like Domscheit would at least make sure his book got right! (Probably also thanks to the journalist.)<br/><br/>Still, many interesting bits. I remember thinking way back that for a group claiming so many participants & advisers, it had an oddly low flow of leaks - which Domscheit says was because it was mostly him and Assange; makes sense. I was amused to learn that the Iceland laws were based by Assange in part on Stephenson's <i>Cryptonomicon</i> - again, makes sense in a curious way.

This book has all the strengths and weaknesses that this sounds like: on the one hand, these are pretty much all stories I am completely unfamiliar with since the reflections of Venice in things I have read or seen are typically of pre-20 century Venice (think stories like <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> or film works like <i>Aria</i> or histories of the Mediterranean region) and so stories like theaters burning or the Save Venice feuds or the Pound scandal are news; on the other hand, they were news to me because I didn't care about any of them before and I don't care much about them having read <i>Falling Angels</i> either. As one might expect, there's not much cohesiveness to the stories beyond the narrator himself because real life is not so cooperative as to combine all the storylines into a single satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>On the positive side: Berendt is a fine writer who smoothly narrates events and lets people speak for themselves more than most writers would. He is aware of the danger of relying on gossip and seems to keep an open mind as he critically examines all the versions and stories he's told, and he seems to have spoken to everyone so he has plenty to compare. He also has a good eye for details and and interesting people and anecdotes. I don't regret reading it, even if I don't expect to ever re-read it nor learned any 'big' truths or stories.


  *[The Autobiography Of Benvenuto Cellini](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0140447180&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                            Benvenuto Cellini                ★★★      1999   2012/10/05   To read this, one wonders how Cellini survived to age 20, much less age 70! He is constantly killing and being attacked, wenching his models, contracting hideous illnesses (or noting in passing the constant unexpected death of others), and being betrayed (by this account) or insulting others. It's an endless exhausting cycle such that even Cellini had to notice its futility and danger. One has to wonder how much he exaggerates: aside from the demonology and weather-controlling, it seems so routine for people to go around armed and attacking for minor insults and then dying of a scratch. Then there is his strange attitude to his patrons: on the one hand, he seems largely unable to criticize them or the system despite wallowing in their corruption and wealth (surely the King of France wasn't all *that*, and given the sheer servility & ignobility & criminality of the popes he deals with, his tolerance of them is astounding), but on the other hand, he almost goes out of his way to mess with them.<br/><br/>Well, it's fun in small doses, the constant tumult of Cellini's life suggests that the constant murder & assault & theft & large gifts we read of in picaresques or stories (like the *Decameron*) are much more realistic than we give them credit for, and it's pretty cool to look at the Wikipedia article and see images of the works he labors over at such length in his autobiography.


  *[Newton and the Counterfeiter: The Unknown Detective Career of the World's Greatest Scientist](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0151012784&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                      Thomas Levenson                  ★★★      2009   2014/03/21   A quick breezy read good for an evening; Levenson touches on the highlights of Newton's early life & throughout keeps an eye out for the telling detail or quote which might bring the past to life for us, is sympathetic towards the alchemy and tries to put it in a context, and then plunges into Newton's war with an obscure counterfeiter.<br/><br/>This section would make good background reading for Neal Stephenson's <i>Baroque Cycle</i> (despite Levenson's book being published in 2009 and the cycle finished in 2004, and the latter being one of the few places a reader might have encountered Newton in the same breath as counterfeiters, entirely unmentioned), as it pretty clearly explains the monetary issues of clipping, recoining, balance of exchange with Asia, etc, in a less digressive & action-packed manner than Stephenson's doorstoppers.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Newton was so involved in criminal matters, but in some respects Levenson is trying to wring blood from a stone: Newton doesn't seem to have been any Sherlock Holmes (an apt comparison since Moriarty was an expert on Newtonian mechanics), but rather, just obsessive & hardworking and applying all the standard investigative techniques. The story is hampered also by the relatively low amount of documentation (one wonders what the boxes of documents Newton burned would have revealed).

The overall combination is good but nothing to write home about. The frequent appearance of autonomous vehicles is a nice touch and one too often absent from SF, near or far. Most of the technical details were good (I was not surprised to read the short author bio and learn Suarez is a practicing programmer, since the Ross character felt like an author self-insert).<br/><br/>But the decentralized conspiracy was done better in Sterling's "Maneki Neko", the creepy persuasive AI was done better in 'Friendship is Optimal', the technical detail in *Cryptonomicon*, the futuristic developments in *Otherland*, and the plutocracy/government stuff in multiple William Gibson novels (Suarez's version being more than a little bit crude - citing *Confessions of an Economic Hitman*, really?).<br/><br/>And despite the lauded technical detail, the AI presented is farcical; it's hard to see how any 'logic tree' could possibly handle all that the AI does even if Suarez throws in some failures to parse responses and writes up . (If I had an iPhone I'd probably snark about how Siri can understand the responses given by various characters fine, and hasn't taken over the world.)

Thompson               ★★★      1998   2014/08/19   <i>Fear and Loathing</i> is famous through osmosis: the opening chapters, the lines about bats, ether, drug collections, etc. The first quarter or so of the novel is justly famous. The rest of it... one wonders. After Duke & his lawyer wake up to go to the race, most of the rest is fairly unmemorable (in particular, the two halves stitched together structure is fairly crude.) The story is not terribly long, and it feel like the mostly-nonfiction it is: drug fiction tends to the 'you had to be there' kind of humor, and we were none of us there.<br/><br/>It also aspires to a greater import than it ever achieves, gesturing toward the 'American dream' and finding 'fear and loathing', which from this remote perspective, looks like bombast & bluff - we know the Nixonian moment would pass in an epic crash, that the USSR would fall, that the War on Drugs would not be "a boot stamping on a human face - forever". (In particular, the famous 'wave' quote seems arbitrary and unsupported by its surrounding text, although I don't doubt that Thompson felt those sentiments deeply.) So, the opening is fantastic, but the rest isn't really worth reading now, for an average less than its repute would suggest.

Banks                    ★★★      2008                Absurdly lengthy, with one of the slowest setups ever followed by an equally abrupt and unsatisfactory resolution which kills off pretty much every character we might have even a faint interest in† thanks to something which is introduced out of nowhere maybe 4/5s of the way through. Banks is a great author, so of course there are plenty of rewarding nuggets scattered through out (the haunted ex-Culture man, the deceptive artifact, the general convincingness of 'the stage is small but the audience great' theme etc.), but much less than expected from a groaning tome's worth of Banks. The shell world concept is not developed or employed well (you could replace all of the maneuverings with 2D equivalents if you wished), and the rest of the background and concepts seem pretty stock Culture.<br/><br/>† eg. I was expecting the betrayal to be linked to alien machinations, but no, it turns out to be exactly as simplistic as it seems, the ex-SC guy's good argument to the contrary, and a complete red herring as he dies with everyone else, the complexity of his character never ascending beyond cackling evil.

I see complaints online that 'Streets' is an unfair caricature and reveals Harrison's stock atheism, but it's hard to lay out the world, story, maintain a decent style, and also be subtle or fair in just a few pages), but that's a price I'm willing to pay. Also on the downside for a modern reader, Harrison shared the common SF preoccupation with the 'population bomb' and coming Peak Oil/great dieback; neither of which seem to have happened, thankfully, but they still irritate one to read just a little bit.<br/><br/>Hence, I couldn't give this a 4 or a 5, but I don't regret reading it since some were pretty good and I did laugh while reading some. So a 3 it is. RIP, Harrison.


  *[Shadow Games (The Chronicle of the Black Company, \#4)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0812533828&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                            Glen Cook                        ★★★      1989   2013/06/12   Croaker and company head south, and things go surprisingly smoothly and well in the African countries they travel through until south of the Nile, they discover an evil empire is in their path menacing an innocent Babylonian-style city. Naturally, *Dances with Wolves* style, they'll help the hapless natives protect themselves. And we get not one but *four* of the old Taken coming back to life (Howler, Shaper, Stormbringer, and Soulcatcher) -\_-. Oh and also a 'buried evil' a la the Dominator. Yes, another one. That's what, the third now? Good grief.<br/><br/>Like the previous book, my complaint here is that the plot is simple and straightforward, parts of it are very ham-handed (eg. once I got over my disgust at yes, another Taken was back, it was pretty obvious where the crows were coming from).<br/><br/>The upside is that it's fun watching Croaker becoming the Captain and growing still more.


  *[Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Highway](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0385419945&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                     Clifford Stoll                   ★★★      1996                I read this not long after publication, and re-read it a year ago weeding through my books. Between the two, I would have to give it 2-3 stars.<br/><br/>The good part is that at the time, he was correct in puncturing or deflating a lot of the most hyperbolic claims about the benefits of computers and the Internet: online shopping did have a ways to go, kids' education was not being improved by computers (and may still not be), etc.<br/><br/>The bad part is, he was correct only in the short run. On many claims or predictions where he was absolutist, he is laughably wrong now, and we can expect his track record to continue to worsen as time passes.<br/><br/>This is actually a pretty common failure mode for skeptics of technologies: I call this the Amara effect, after Roy Amara: "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run."

My opinion was modified only somewhat by reading Isaacson's *Steve Jobs*: Jobs could be munificent and non-penny-pinching - for anything to do with *himself*.


  *[House of Leaves](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=038560310X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mark Z. Danielewski              ★★★      2000                As impressive and inventive a multimedia presentation this is, it's hard not to think that the fictional Navidson movie described by the novel would be far more interesting or moving than the actual novel is, dragged down by a narrator who is interesting neither in voice nor message; 'trying too hard' is a phrase I apply to some experimental or postmodern works, and it fits here better than most. And are we to be moved by this? The labyrinth is constantly described and discussed in it, but one thing that goes unnoticed is that with the exception of Daedalus's labyrinth, at the enter of almost all labyrinths is nothing at all, and when one reaches it, the only thing to is shrug and head back out.


  *[The Judging Eye (Aspect-Emperor, \#1)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1590201698&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                             R. Scott Bakker                  ★★★      2009                Bakker says he's influenced by Frank Herbert, and it's nowhere clearer than here - the reader of *Dune Messiah* will notice the uncanny echos. The final sequence is the almost inevitable theft from Tolkien of the Mines of Moria, but it's sufficiently exciting and well-done that unlike a similar theft in *The Sword of Shannara* I didn't put down the book in disgust.<br/><br/>*The Thousandfold Thought* was a sheer disappointment, and I did wonder whether to continue on to *The Judging Eye*, but I don't much regret it. The new characters are still pretty dubious (Mimara is just an annoyance), but the psychopathic son has real promise as a very dark inversion of Leto II.


  *[No Country for Old Men](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0375706674&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Cormac McCarthy                  ★★★      2006   2012/08/28   Somehow a disappointment, especially compared with *Blood Meridian*. It has some fantastic moments & writing (eg. Chigurh's first coin toss), but wrapped in a plot which feels simplistic, cheap, linear, and video game-like; I thought at one moment that it was no surprise that it made what was apparently a great movie, since it read like a screenplay version of the real novel. Harold Bloom mentioned that the apocalypticism was a flaw, and here I would agree: it's a flaw I've also seen surface in Gene Wolfe, and which tarnishes the stories or novels which take up a crude - dare I say, conservative? - sort of jeremiad against these fallen latter days.


  *[The Rapture of the Nerds: A tale of the singularity, posthumanity, and awkward social situations](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0765329107&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                  Cory Doctorow                    ★★★      2012                A mixed bag. A third of the way through, I was ready for 2 stars, and reading only because I remembered the preview as being pretty good; it was reading like the worst parts of Doctorow crossed with cutting-floor scraps from Stross's *Accelerando* (general advice: if you haven't read *Accelerando* yet, I strongly strongly recommend it over *Rapture of the Nerds*).<br/><br/>After suffering through the crap of the first half, I *finally* get to the real story (recommendation: C-f to "It's the Singularity!" if you want to save yourself the grief). This is pretty fun and decent, although the judge scenario is far from new.


  *[Chinese History in Economic Perspective](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0520070682&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thomas G. Rawski                 ★★★      1992   2012/09/08   Fairly technical, largely not of interest to non-specialists. Some of the papers captured my interest: the demographic analysis revealing very high infanticide rates and mortality patterns of females was quite interesting, and some of the papers revealed a better integrated and more sophisticated Chinese market economy than I had expected, with less income inequality or dysfunctionality than one gets the picture of when reading of pre-WWII warlordism and civil war.<br/><br/>(I read <a href="http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6489p0n6&brand=ucpress">the online version</a>.)


  *[The Wallet of Kai Lung (Kai Lung \#1)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=5551096130&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ernest Bramah                    ★★★      2002   2013/07/19   One reads this for the language on display by Bramah: the absurd sustained Latinate circumlocutions which forever perendinate and cunctate on expressing their simple sense. As far as that goes, it's quite an interesting exercise and the source of a number of parodic versions of China/Japan, I suspect. I am not sure how many people are up to a entire sustained anthology of this, though: the stories are relatively flimsy and one can drown in the prose while losing track utterly of the plot and personages, which certainly is not calculated to create charm nor cheer in the consumer.


  *[Portfolios of the Poor: How the World's Poor Live on \$2 a Day](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0691141487&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                    Daryl Collins                    ★★★      2009   2012/12/10   The first 2 or 3 chapters are very interesting and enlightening on the risk borne by the poor and how they do their best to cope; however, the rest is generally repetitive and shows the same data in somewhat different ways and countries, and become boring quickly - making this one of the padded books which would've been a better read as a longform article or essay. (One exception is the discussion of APRs and how the loans actually are done which renders them far less usurious.) Ironically, the appendices were more interesting than many of the narratives in the later chapters.


  *[A Random Walk Down Wall Street](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0393325350&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Burton G. Malkiel                ★★★      2004                It's hard to believe at this point that Malkiel's views on the desirability of indexing and not trading and the basic truth of the efficient market hypothesis were ever controversial or not conventional wisdom (the 1 and 2 star reviews here notwithstanding... how many geniuses like Peter Thiel blew up betting against Treasuries in the past few years, guys? Efficient markets FTW.), but nevertheless, he was a pioneer. I didn't wind up learning too much from this since it's targeted at beginners, but that is not its fault and the advice is generally sound.


  *[Kim](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0140183523&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Rudyard Kipling                  ★★★      1981                Though it's one of his most famous, I found it hard to like. It's laden in Orientalism, picaresque almost to a fault, the Buddhism is a little laughable for all that it might have been state of the art in the 1800s (although less laughable than the ornate antique language forced on every character), and the plot is a bit of a trainwreck with endless pages lavished on Kim growing up only to abruptly end in a short theft of documents and an equally abrupt and unsatisfying finish to the religious quest that previously drove events.


  *[Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1594202532&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                   Clay Shirky                      ★★★      2010   2012/10/03   Short, fluffy - an attempt to expand on what is a pretty short idea at core. If you read or watched any of his previous talks like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121005045511/http://www.edge.org/conversation.php?cid=gin-television-and-cognitive-surplus">"GIN, TELEVISION, AND COGNITIVE SURPLUS"</a> and have followed some of his other writings, there's little new here for you. One advantage of being in book form is that he includes his references.


  *[Everything Bad is Good for You](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1594481946&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Steven Johnson                   ★★★      2006   2011/11/03   I thought it was very short and not in depth at all; yeah, his handful of graphs of episodes was interesting from the data visualization viewpoint, but most of his arguments, such as they were, were qualitative and hand-wavey. (What, there are no simplistic shows these days?) The best I can say is: the thesis is not *obviously* impossible or wrong a priori, but needs a heck of a lot more empirical backing.


  *[Spice and Wolf, Book 1](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0759531048&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Isuna Hasekura                   ★★★      2009   2013/07/28   I'm afraid this suffers badly in comparison with the anime: Hasekura isn't nearly as good at conveying Lawrence & Holo's interactions as good animators + good seiyuu, and really, that's the heart of the story. If you can't get that perfect, then there's not much to it, and the irritating aspects of light novels come to the fore (very short, sketchy chapters, endings that feel almost rushed, etc).


  *[Psychiatry And The Human Condition](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1857753143&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                Bruce G. Charlton                ★★★      2000   2012/10/23   Not really sure what to make of it; it has interesting ideas but so broad that one has no idea if they're right or if Charlton is hiding fatal evidence (he doesn't have the best reputation these days, and this book way back when wasn't received with acclamations), and one would have to be an expert oneself to know whether Charlton is putting the pieces together in a licit way.


  *[The Chicago World's Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=048623990X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                           Stanley Appelbaum                ★★★      1980   2013/08/07   As the other reviews say: worth it for the photographs, not so much the commentary. Some might be a little disappointed by the focus on the neo-classical prestige buildings and not parts us moderns would find of vastly more interest, like the first Ferris wheel, the first Japanese building in the US, Wild Bill's show, etc, but it's still much better than nothing.


  *[Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0061176044&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                    Kathryn Schulz                   ★★★      2010                Touched on a lot of the standard points and citations you'd see somewhere in skeptical literature like LessWrong, but in a very much fuzzier humanities sort of way. Couldn't really recommend it unless you're the sort of person who has never heard of Tetlock or Quine or the studies on eyewitness fallibility or read their Kahneman etc - for beginners only.


  *[Silently and Very Fast](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1936896001&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Catherynne M. Valente            ★★★      2011   2012/01/01   Read this on <a href="http://masi.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/algae-2012-09.html">Cosma Shalizi's recommendation</a>.<br/><br/>While the writer is clearly skilled, the style grates and the story leaves me cold: the only fairy tale that really spoke to me was Turing's (but turning his life into a fairy tale, given his death, is almost cheating).


  *[The Cinema of George Lucas](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0810949687&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Marcus Hearn                     ★★★      2005   2012/04/26   Like any authorized, lots of interesting details, gorgeous photos, and thorough with the glaring exception of zero critical thought or criticism or appraisal (except, perhaps, for brief discussions of how Lucas wrote the *Star Wars* movies drawing on friends and acquaintances, a system which seemed to break down for the prequels - with dismal results).


  *[The Difference Engine ](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=055329461X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            William Gibson                   ★★★      1992   2011/03/10   Struck me as a lot like Stephenson's Baroque Cycle though it came long before, and while very interesting and inventive, somehow the overall story never really gelled for me - I think the problem may be that Gibson doesn't develop his milieu in enough detail or imaginatively enough that the world and its characters can really come to life for one.


  *[It's behind you - The making of a computer Game](http://bizzley.com/)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Bob Pape                         ★★★      2013   2013/09/30   Vividly conveys the fly-by-night and chaos of early computer games and some of the contortions & challenges of dealing with the limited computers of the day. All in all, though, I think Mechner's <a href="http://jordanmechner.com/ebook/"><i> The Making of Prince of Persia</i></a> is a better read if you're not specifically interested in R-Type.


  *[Policeman's Beard is Half-Constructed: Computer Prose and Poetry](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0446380512&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                  Racter                           ★★★      1984   2010/01/01   Summary: the dreams quote in the Wikipedia article really was the most evocative part of the collection. Most of it wasn't worth reading, and extremely suspiciously sophisticated and likely written by Chamberlain, which reduces the novelty value. (I read <a href="http://www.ubu.com/concept/racter.html">the online version</a>.)


  *[Making Money (Discworld, \#36)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0061161640&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Terry Pratchett                  ★★★      2007   2012/01/18   Pretty mediocre, hard to believe plot (since when did Ankh-Morpork need *fiat* money? the gold standard went fine for highly industrialized countries right up to the Depression), and when did the patrician become the philosopher-king? I enjoyed it much less than *Hogfather*, which I read around the same time.


  *[A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0575071346&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Harry Harrison                   ★★★      2000   2011/05/25   Rather short, but a fast read - Victorian flavored but not unreadable like a lot of steampunk. Decent but not great alternate history. (To call it great, I'd want it to be harder alt history with more details about how a transatlantic tunnel could even work at all, wrapped into a more engrossing story.)


  *[Handbook of Psychopathy](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1593855915&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Christopher J. Patrick           ★★★      2007   2012/09/07   Highly technical and definitely not for anyone who has not read on the topic before or read a great deal of psychology research. Some papers are a waste, but some other papers are really good: I admired Harris & Rice 2006, and especially their careful analysis/takedown of the Salekin meta-analysis.


  *[Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1594202230&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                        Matthew B. Crawford              ★★★      2009   2012/10/15   Overall, makes many good points.<br/><br/>His discussions of computers, though, are not very well-informed; in particular, his footnote on Godel and Turing is pretty bad, although I think he may just have been misled by the authors he's relying on like Searle, Penrose, and Andrew Hodges.


  *[Back to Methuselah](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1426467540&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                George Bernard Shaw              ★★★      2007   2013/01/15   Strange - a sort of extremely slow progress that runs antithetical to modernity. In many ways (in terms of the nonfiction aspect of Shaw's project), J.B.S Haldane's "Daedalus, or, Science and the Future" is far superior, or Bernal's *The World, the Flesh, and the Devil*.


  *[Ragnarok](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1847670644&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A.S. Byatt                       ★★★      2011   2011/10/19   Byatt's Norse is not mine; she writes very well, but to me, Norse myth is about the striking verse, the illuminating kenning, the weirdly powerful line, yoked to phantasmagoric unconnected incidents under the dark shadow of Wyrd... (Much shorter than expected.)


  *[10 Print Chr\$(205.5+rnd(1)); Goto 10](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0262018462&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                             Nick Montfort                    ★★★      2012   2012/12/02   A "world in a grain of sand" enterprise, it succeeds better at the task than I expected. (The sections on modern art are very strained, however. I would've preferred some mathematical analysis of the mazes generated and their properties to that whole section.)


  *[Vader's Little Princess](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1452118698&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Jeffrey Brown                    ★★★      2013   2013/08/02   Cute, but superficial as intended. The main appeal of this for me was seeing just how many classic <i>Star Wars</i> lines or scenes could be twisted into hoary stereotypical teen jokes - it was many more than I would have expected!


  *[Musa Pedestris - Three Centuries of Canting Songs and Slang Rhymes [1536 - 1896]](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=1435377338&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                  John S. Farmer                   ★★★      2007                A great source for writers wishing to use cant since it shows them off in context. The best poem (most are pedestrian in the negative sense) would be "Villon's Straight Tip To All Cross Coves", which is a marvel of its kind.


  *[Economic Analysis of the Law: Selected Readings](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=9780631231585 &page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                               Donald A. Wittman                ★★★      2002   2011/10/20   Best essays were the blackmail, aboriginal, sports, and baby markets. The earlier ones were terribly dry, theoretical, and often justified themselves by appealing to rational actors and the status quo.


  *[Empty Words: Buddhist Philosophy and Cross-Cultural Interpretation](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0195146727&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                Jay L. Garfield                  ★★★      2001   2012/08/27   Much of it is relatively technical, especially the parts dealing with Nagarjuna, and not suited to those who haven't read the key texts. I did enjoy the comparison with Sextus Empiricus a lot, though.


  *[The Luck Factor: Changing Your Luck, Changing Your Life - The Four  Essential Principles](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0786869143&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                          Richard Wiseman                  ★★★      2003   2011/05/23   This book is almost too padded to be worth reading. Is there a condensed version anywhere? The ideas seem like they might have something to them, but it's hard to find the meat under the flab.


  *[The Sword of Good](http://lesswrong.com/lw/169/the_sword_of_good/)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Eliezer Yudkowsky                ★★★      2009                A clever subversive ending doesn't make a story great. To some extent, this critique was done much better in Spinrad's *The Iron Dream* or Herbert's *Dune*/*Dune Messiah* for that matter.


  *[Surface Detail (Culture, \#9)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0316123404&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Iain M. Banks                    ★★★      2010   2011/07/20   The usual intertwined Banks plotting was easier to follow this time, and the overall resolution very satisfactory. Not as interesting as *Player of Games*, but still a solid Culture novel


  *[The Children of the Sky  (Zones of Thought \#3)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0312875622&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                   Vernor Vinge                     ★★★      2011   2011/11/01   As much as I like the Zones of Thought universe, this drags in the middle, Tine society isn't as interesting second time around, and it doesn't end the storyline.

Some of his pieces are online, linked from <a href="http://www.buttercupfestival.com/poetry.htm">his poetry page</a>: <a href="http://barnstormjournal.org/poetry/the-river-bridge/">“The River Bridge”</a>, <a href="http://www.epoetry.org/issues/issue8/text/poems/troupes1.htm">“The Brook”</a>, <a href="http://www.thepedestalmagazine.com/gallery.php?item=2198">“The Mill River”</a>, <a href="http://barnstormjournal.org/poetry/a-stop-on-the-road-north/">“A Stop on the Road North”</a> & <a href="http://www.geopoetics.org.uk/online-journal-stravaig/stravaig-1-contents/richard-meyers-and-david-troupes/">“The Simple Man Arriving Through the Fields”</a> (both also in <em>The Simple Men</em>). Those are representative. How much you like the collection will depend on your fondness for modern free verse about nature, vaguely spiritual musings, and incidents from ordinary lives - how much, for example, you thrill to lines like the last 2 stanzas of “The Simple Man in Love with the Sound of Things”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>and through the walls the frail<br />transmissions of our neighbors’ living - and too<br />this eruption<br />of crickets in the summer fields,</p><br/><p>this slow harmony of beats<br />which is the sound of everything loving<br />and warring in unison.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>One piece that struck me is the short prose piece “The Ghost” (which works better for not being jammed into a free verse formatting):</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>We saw a ghost one day, while we were playing. All the children from our street had come together to run in and out of the bushes and trees, a chaotic chasing sort of game, everyone sweaty and pine-scratched. Someone up a tree saw a boy in a blue shirt standing by a mail box on the far side of the road, just standing there with a strange face. We ran to see who it was but he was gone. We raced up and down the houses, we dove into the leaves, we caught snatches of his shirt, flutters in our eye-corners, but never found the boy. We talked about the ghost for weeks - the glimpses we’d all had.</p><br/><p>What color will the fire be when these ridiculous things burn?</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>The Buddhist undertones reminds me of Christine Hartzler’s <a href="http://www.unf.edu/mudlark/posters/hartzler.html">“The Teachings”</a>, as does to some extent the final stanza of “The Boy Who Got Lost Following a River”, “I walk the starry meadows, the cool hampers of August / where the bees of midnight / gather their strange pollen.” I wouldn’t emphasize this too much since being genuinely Buddhist would be a bit contradictory to the ethos of the poems, put explicitly in the end of the prose piece “Ocean Point”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>…It was Tuesday, the hotel kitchen was closed and there would be no staff meal so we had to fend for ourselves. We ordered what we wanted and then crossed the road to the schoolyard, where in the middle of a perfect lawn arced the ropes and pipes of new-looking play equipment. For fifteen minutes we pumped our legs on the swings and launched ourselves into darkness. When the pizzas were ready we took them back to the staff house and tore off pieces in our mouths and ate, because we loved life, and we wanted to go on living.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>I didn’t think much of “At Whately Dinner”, which seems to try for shock value in explicitness, and comes off juvenile and degrading to read. Troupes often tries too hard with phrases and obscure words, using them when there is no particular impact; “The Deer on the Sunsetting Hill” offers many examples: “rich vernum”, “Flees / across the lea, through evening’s / furnace-draft”, “Exquisite vacancy”, “Taper of autumnal sabbath”, “the betrothed / quicken their beauty and truth”, “the rubied heat of the fragile imperfect”, “an owl / downs its mouse-pith”, “O Love, listen / please, listen, and remember me to the whole - / the deer settled in its truth / the air velvet-smooth / with river smell”.</p><br/><p>T.S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens could get away with what they did because they had an infallible ear for rhythm and expression, so their glittering generalities worked. They don’t usually work here, and it’s a bit agonizing trying to get through some of the poems (I must confess, while I’ve read it twice, I have not actually read “The Icefisherman at Dusk” because my eyes keep glazing over a few pages in). A less kind reviewer might mock some of the expressions (“each tree in the rain shaking / grandly / like a tree in the rain”) but I cannot because I detect no insincerity or dishonesty here; Troupes deserves to write good poems, but I’m not sure he can. (Randall Jarrell puts his thumb on this tendency: “When one reads the verse of people who cannot write poems — people who sometimes have more intelligence, sensibility, and moral discrimination than most of the poets — it is hard not to regard the Muse as a sort of fairy godmother who says to the poet, after her colleagues have showered on him the most disconcerting and ambiguous gifts, ‘Well, never mind. You’re still the only one that can write poetry.’”)</p><br/><p>My usual standard for poetry anthologies is whether I felt compelled to copy or keep any; like <em>The Fountain</em>, I found nothing in <em>The Simple Men</em> I wanted to keep.</p>

Sowell is not that great a prose stylist and has a gift for putting things in ways that irritate the hell out of me even when I already agree with him.<br/><br/>More importantly, the promise of the flaps and introduction is *not* borne out as far as I read. It was not an investigation, either psychological or historical or economic, of intellectuals or recent intellectual history. It was simply a partisan rant bringing up all the old arguments and citations we've seen a million times before; I give him points for thorough - dare I say, intellectual - sourcing, which is more than one can say about eg. Michael Moore or Ann Coulter's books (he wrote, damning with faint praise).<br/><br/>There are arguments in it which I find hard to believe would pass Sowell's own muster if they were dressed up in liberal guise.<br/><br/>For example, on pg27 I was shocked to see - in the middle of his haranguing liberals for insufficient attention to economics - him *seriously* argue that oil company executive salaries are irrelevant because they add only a dime to the cost of gasoline gallons! Wow! Imagine Sowell's reaction to the following argument: "regulation XYZ is not worth debating about because, after all, when implemented it will add no more than a dime to the cost of gas" - can there be any doubt that he would rip this argument to little eeny-weeny shreds for failing to 'think on the margin' and realize that an extra dime will make or break many economic decisions and ramify throughout the economy? How was it possible for him to write such a transparently partisan thing? Because it was a good bash at his enemies.<br/><br/>('Politics is the mind-killer', as we say on LessWrong.)<br/><br/>Or another example from pg21; having finished reciting the Hayekian argument that no one can generalize over the entire economy or populace and central planning is impossible, he then goes on (???) to discuss how Cicero told his friend all English slaves were completely worthless and how Teddy Roosevelt hated all Indians and rather than criticizing their opinions as a perfect example of the intellectual's arrogance in generalizing from tiny tiny samples (both Cicero and Teddy were intellectuals par excellance), he *defends* their bigotry, arguing that critics are themselves being arrogant! What is this I don't even -<br/><br/>It came as no surprise on pg28 to see a caricature of economic libertarianism and zero mentions of standing disproofs of the simplistic models like Coase's point about large firms being economic absurdities and central planning in a different disguise, since I wasn't expecting very much any more.<br/><br/>By pg30, I abandoned my sporadic note-taking and began playing a little game: write down every time a thinker or politician who could be described as conservative or libertarian is criticized or given as an example of the evils of intellectualism.<br/>Naturally, I didn't expect to see Hayek come up for hobnobbing with dictatorships (any more than people discussing Mother Theresa usually bring up her more questionable funding sources), but still - an entire book ought to provide at least 1 or 2 examples.<br/><br/>In the 70s or 80s, I thought I might *finally* have something to add to my list: Naziism and Italian fascism. Surely those would get criticized, as they notoriously aimed to remake their entire societies, with disastrous results? But no! I learned, to my surprise, apparently fascism and Naziism are socialist liberal parties and they are just more liberal examples of intellectual arrogance!<br/><br/>Apparently no one on the right end of the political spectrum has ever proposed or implemented any bad idea, ever. Even if I granted the fairness and accuracy of all his descriptions of left-wingers, his conclusions or synthesis would be completely worthless as it omits half the political spectrum! It would be like doing a study of cancer patients and throwing out every patient who was a Democrat - what could you possibly hope to learn at the en, after you did that?<br/><br/>The Naziism-is-socialism finally broke me. Writing a bad review is not so worthwhile as to be worth going through this. The book was nothing but capsule hitjobs of everyone Sowell disliked at any point, and gave no indication that it would be anything but that for the entire rest of the book.<br/><br/>Life is too short to read Sowell, and I had Charles Murray's *Coming Apart: The State of White America* to read, which I've been looking forward to reading for a long time.

The bulk of the pamphlet is short poems, most under a page and 1-4 irregular-length stanzas, all in free verse (no stronger meters or organizations), typically on natural themes. There’s a bit of prose. The middle few pages are devoted to miscellaneous drawings, some of which I enjoyed. The verse itself is without a doubt in the vein of academic 20th/21st century free verse; at its best, it can produce striking images and little diamonds, and at its worse it is just words placed wearisomely one after another hinting out sentiments too juvenile to ever be written out plainly. For example, Troupes actually starts the collection with a nice one in “As the Crow Flies”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>A crow rises<br />like ink unspilling itself<br />from the pines</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>Basho would have approved. Once or twice Troupes tries a formalist game; it works well in the case of “At Beckett Street Cemetery”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>I.</p><br/><p>The stones are an elaborate deception.<br />The grass has gone to seed.<br />The doves are eloquent of your years abroad.<br />The ivy pours from the trees in genuflection.</p><br/><p>II.</p><br/><p>The ivy is an elaborate deception.<br />The stones have gone to seed.<br />The grass is eloquent of your years abroad.<br />The doves pour from the trees in genuflection.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>The second one, “Excerpt From Waterbody Crossing Table”, does not work at all and I won’t bother quoting it.</p><br/><p>Some just end lamely, and whatever moment prompted them flees uncaptured; for example, “At the World Hater’s Cafe”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>Sitting there, Love,<br />and reading<br />those foreign papers, it would have been easy<br />to forget that America<br />is more than the news about America -<br />to forget, for instance, just to begin,<br />the blueberry pancakes,<br />of which the menu said<br />you can buy one or two,<br />though the honest waitress told you<br />no,<br />one’s enough,<br />you won’t finish two.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>One gets nothing out of this, and it might as well be prose with the lines messed up. The worst may be the final eponymous poem, “The Fountain”:</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p>Bright blare, fountain-forest,<br />pearlescent</p><br/><p>rooster tails and mothers bending<br />with their children to play.</p><br/><p>The cherries are in and all blossom.<br />What</p><br/><p>life<br />water has when children want it.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p>One gets the idea what the collection is like. Overall, when it comes to poetry, my criterion is fairly simple: did I like any of the poems enough to want to copy them out and to memorize them? If there were 1 or 2, that was a good collection, and if there were more, it was a great collection. After reading <em>The Fountain</em> twice, I feel the need to copy none of them, so it was not a good collection for me.</p>


  *[Fascinating Mathematical People: Interviews and Memoirs](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0691148295&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                           Donald J. Albers                 ★★       2011   2014/10/18   Interviews with 16 mathematicians 1990 - 2010, similar to the earlier volume <i>Mathematical People</i> (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11004626-gwern#">my review of it</a>). I don't recognize any of the interviewees: Ahlfors, Apostol, Bacon, Banchoff, Bankoff, Beckenbach, Benjamin, Cartwright, Gallian, Guy, Hunt, McDuff, Saari, Selberg, Taylor, Tondeur.<br/><br/>On the whole, I found this volume far less interesting than the other collection. Most of the subjects are post-WWII, non-European (certainly not part of the fascinatingly aristocratic-but-democratic pre-war European mathematical communities), and their lives come off as colorless beneficiaries of the post-WWII expansion of higher ed, moving fairly easily from undergrad to grad to tenure. The interviewers don't have as much personal connection to the interviewees. The exceptions are not always pleasant to read about; Ahlfors, a Finn who had made his way to the USA before WWII, recounts how he patriotically moved himself <i>and</i> his family back to Finland, contributed zilch to the war effort, and then had to place himself & his family at great risk in getting back out of Europe, the sort of story one expects to end with "and then 15 years later, their remains were discovered in a shallow grave near the main road" (meanwhile, I am thinking "you stupid Finn - you went <i>back</i>? You would have helped infinitely more if you had stayed back in the USA or UK!") Few of them can claim to be nearly as colorful as Conway or Diaconis etc, and there's a really striking absence of computers or statistics or anything you might call application. (I think there is one meaningful mention of computers, in the context of computing many zeros of the Riemann function as a heuristic argument for it being true.) This is particularly astonishing given the time period they were interviewed over. I also think that the earlier interviews did better jobs of explaining their professional topics than these do; how they manage the trick of simultaneously being boring or uninformative about the people and being boring or uninformative about their work too, I am not sure. I think they may simply be much shorter but I haven't done a word-count.<br/><br/>The interviews are not 100% rubbish, though. Guy & Selberg make some interesting remarks. Saari is quite amusing. Joseph Gallian's interview paints a memorable picture of union factory work and the occupational hazards which frightened him into mathematics. Dusa McDuff had both a somewhat unusual life and an interesting grandmother. Other than that<br/><br/>Overall, the selection of interviews gave me an impression that in some respects, these were the leftovers. To be read only if one is already interested in one of the interviewees.


  *[Soldiers Live (The Chronicle of the Black Company, \#9)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0812566556&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                           Glen Cook                        ★★       2001   2013/06/16   A weirdly quiet and sedate ending to the entire series.<br/><br/>It's great that we have Croaker back so the series begins as it ended, but the plot is just too odd and incomplete. Everything happens too easily - I began worrying as I started the book, there were too many loose ends and nothing set up for a grand ending, and that's exactly what happened. We have the Black Company at the start overpowered as usual, as it has since Smoky started napping, with the further assistance of an even more overpowered demon; they slice through resistance with the greatest of ease, enemies like Soulcatcher or Booboo or Goblin go down trivially, and even the final defeat of Kina comes as trivial anticlimax (how the deuce did it make a lick of sense that the ancient gods couldn't destroy Kina if a little hedge wizard's spear and an exploding airplane can do the trick?!). The 'twist' ending is not shocking or compelling, and my reaction was 'oh. Well, that's nice for Croaker, I guess.' I'm sure there's all good explanations in-universe along the lines of 'the demon was helping them the entire time and eg. that's why the forvalaka dies so easily', but an explanation is just an explanation and it doesn't rescue a bad story.<br/><br/>I'm left just shaking my head, wondering what went wrong. Why did Cook go to such lengths to introduce a character as powerful and hence game-breaking as Tobo while implying a narrative of power-corrupts which never goes anywhere besides one or two instances of revenge? Why did he make the demon so cooperative? Why did he make the Howler die, in what must be the *only* instance in the entire damn series where a Taken dies and stays dead?! And so on and so forth. Reading through some interviews with Cook, I find myself wondering if he just wanted to stop the series and didn't really try hard on the ending - he certainly comes off as cynical and mercenary about writing, with little of Croaker's faith in the power of the Annals. Looking back, many of the books in *The Black Company* were weak enough that I can't really blame him for intending to stop with the first one, but now that I'm done, I'm not sure I'll bother with any future books in the universe (apparently he has one or two in the pipeline).<br/><br/>Although the title is excellent and used well.


  *[Light](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0553382950&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             M. John Harrison                 ★★       2004   2014/03/30   See the top Goodreads review by Evan (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/26441188). Overall, <i>Light</i> is a huge disappointment given the glowing reviews given of it by the likes of Neil Gaiman and previous work of Harrison I've read like <i>Virconium</i>: occasional flash of inspiration in worldbuilding, excellent writing in parts marred by flat descriptions, repetition (particularly anything to do with K-ships), and some deeply questionable approaches to depicting sex.<br/><br/>The three stories come together and intertwine only by a very generous reckoning (the Kearney arc is uniformly awful and a waste of space, especially the shaggy-dog-joke of an ending, making me wonder if Harrison was trying to one-up Banks's <i>Wasp Factory</i> and completely failing) and a healthy dose of authorial fiat for a lamely inept ending, the space-cyberpunk is derivative and much inferior to other works like <i>Schismatrix Plus</i>, the allusions are random and superficial (adding little depth or layering, unlike, for example, many works by Dan Simmons).<br/><br/>Halfway through, I began wondering if maybe I was simply not getting it, if <i>Light</i> was simply '2deep4me'; but the ending confirmed that nope, I understood fine - there was just that little going on underneath the flashy surface.


  *[The Thousandfold Thought (The Prince of Nothing, \#3)](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=158567883X&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks)*                                                                                                                                                                                             R. Scott Bakker                  ★★       2007                A major disappointment; the epic grinds to a baffled conclusion which undermines the interest of the previous two novels. Having wondered for two enormous books what Kelhus's father has been up to, we discover that it is... not much, because he screwed up; having wondered for two enormous books why the Cishaurim attacked the Scarlet Spires, setting in motion a substantial amount of the plot, we learn why and it is beyond stupid (so the Cishaurim on discovering a skin-spy immediately assume it was from the Scarlet Spires, do not negotiate or warn or investigate in any way, and immediately laugh a decapitation strike? If this were TvTropes, it'd be an entry on the Idiot Ball page. One almost wishes Bakker had Moenghus take responsibility, because at least then it would make *some* sense.) The conquests become lackluster after book 2.<br/><br/>The only redeeming aspect is that Paul becoming Padishah Emperor sets us up for *Dune Messiah* - sorry, I mean Kelhus becoming Aspect-Emperor sets us up for *The Judging Eye*, which has more intrinsic interest.

Compiled en masse, it's also easy to be annoyed by various habits of Good's, like mentioning Turing everywhere possible or mentioning Charles Saunders Pierce's anticipation of likelihood ratios but also that it was flawed.

Problem is, Salsburg can't decide whether he's writing a history, a collection of biographies, anecdotes, or explaining modern statistics (early, frequentist, and Bayesian) to a layman, and so it winds up being nothing in particular.<br/>If you want statistics history, I'm sure there are better starting points (McGrayne's *Theory That Would Not Die* being one that comes to mind).

The stories are just too awful and didactic and trapped in a moralizing medieval milieu, centering around caricatured one-dimensional characters. However important and key to the history of literature it is, it's not worth reading for any but scholars or historians.

Tolkien                   ★★       2009                The essential problem with this book is that the Nose wonk will already know most of the background, and the actual poetry is incredibly padded out. Worse, while Tolkien has some marvelous verses that truly work, the gems are buried in page after page of flat mediocrity.

Brenner deals with the minutiae, which may be admirable but I am not *that* interested in the currant trade or lobbying the king for monopolies.

But having finished reading it, I'm disappointed. It's not fit to shine Jaynes's boot buckle; while Jaynes's theory has serious problems (explaining where bicameralism went, worldwide, and other chronological problems, for starters), it at least was an elegant theory that fit a great many facts!<br/><br/>Wright and his co-author, on the other hand, is chock-full of anecdotes (better ping-pong playing and relaxation playing with your left hand? really?); data seems misrepresented (I did not recognize his description of the peg data in the sleep deprivation experiment with the actual graph); dismissal of possibilities as 'implausible' which are perfectly plausible (the claim that testosterone can't damage one hemisphere and help the other comes to mind, as does the claim that there are no plausible evolutionary theories for evolving handedness - actually, there's a very elegant competition explanation which anyone who has done a head-to-head sport like ping-pong or fencing could appreciate); fully general counter-arguments like the claim that not appreciating the theory is evidence of being damaged as the theory predicts; excuse-making for the absence of forest fossils supporting their theory; blatantly false claims about bipedalism mixed in with distraction about the aquatic ape theory; claims about agricultural longevity which are surely the elementary mistake of assuming that infant mortality-dominated average lifespans say much about how adults actually lived; invocation of pseudoscience like photoreading or Carlos Castaneda or 140-year olds in distant Third World countries (seriously? seriously‽) or Alzheimer's and other diseases being caused by dehydration; blatant confirmation bias† (who, interested in people who do not sleep, would mention a Vietnamese woman and <i>not</i> mention fatal familial insomnia?); and of course, vitamin C megadoses must appear in any work by fruitarians, as does the claim that cooking reduces the nutritional value of food (which would come as news to anthropologists, who regard the introduction of fire as possibly the key breakthrough to enabling large expensive brains - except that right, the authors believe that <i>fruit</i> is what enabled large brains, well, I wonder why they might not discuss the caloric value of cooking food... perhaps it's because cooked food doesn't 'raise micro-electric potentials throughout the body').<br/><br/>† which becomes ever more important in data-rich noisy fields like psychology; I actually pointed this out for dual n-back recently on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4204653">Hacker News</a> and more generally in my <a href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#flaws-in-mainstream-science-and-psychology">DNB FAQ</a><br/><br/>The use of autists, idiot savants, and TMS is an interesting topic in its own right, but inadvertently sabotages the thesis. There's a legal saying, 'hard cases make bad law'; in neuroscience, damaged patients make bad theories. The brain is Turing-complete and can exhibit arbitrarily complex problems: these patients tend to be fairly unique, and how are you going to build any kind of theory on them? To the extent we can infer anything, it's that there is a common trait among those with access to low-level processing: they are <i>not smart</i>. Their abilities seem to come at the expense of all other abilities or higher-level processing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek">Kim Peek</a> may have memorized thousands of books, but what sort of understanding did this man with an IQ of 89 exhibit of them? Very little. The child prodigy artist may be able to render remarkably detailed artwork, but a camera is more accurate and just as artistic as I've ever heard him be. This does not bode well for any exaltation of the right hemisphere...<br/><br/>The crowning piece of nonsense is probably the 'loop' between fruits, steroids, and DNA. This idea, lovingly illustrated in multiple graphs, is fractal nonsense: the more you look at each piece, the worse it gets. It's as if someone told you that car evolution was steered by gas stations: you see, a human drives the car to a gas station, the car is filled up with gas, the gas changes the car, changing how it drives to the next gas station and how it reacts to the next fill-up. This may initially seem plausible until you look at step 3, which reads basically like the old *Far Side* strip - <a href="http://star.psy.ohio-state.edu/coglab/Miracle.html">'And then a miracle occurs'</a>. How <i>exactly</i> do steroids rewrite the DNA? A steroid is not a little computer or nanobot which can go into a sperm or egg - and notice the quiet eliding of the difference between somatic and germ-line cells, it's perfectly possible for any genetic or epigenetic changes to not be passed on - and rewrite the DNA as it wishes. If variations in circulating levels of some chemical affect DNA, it must do so via receptors and proteins set up in advance by gradual evolution to do specific things - eg. think of how alligators or crocodiles vary the sex ratio of their offspring in response to ambient temperatures, this is set up in advance because it's useful, the temperature doesn't 'just cause' the sex ratio to vary in some magical way because boy alligators are fiery and analogous to hot weather while female crocodiles are chillier and aloof. (I'm reminded of the genie of the lamp: "I wish everyone was happy!" Well, OK, but what does that <i>actually</i> mean and how should the genie do it?) They are, naturally, as sure of this evolutionary loop as one can be in the complete absence of all evidence.<br/><br/>While we're on DNA, I was deeply amused that they could propose this system as their primary explanation, and then throughout the rest of the book dismiss any further adaptation because a few hundred thousand years was not enough! I really think that we can adapt to eating meat in a few hundred thousand years, especially when our primate ancestors and surviving lineages often do eat meat... It was especially funny to read "It is highly unlikely that the DNA selection process could have achieved this rapid result (certainly not on the savanna where hominids would be subjected to hard and stressful environmental conditions)"; hard and stressful conditions are exactly the kind of selection pressure that might drive large increases in any organ or body part, and allometric scaling in general is one of the easier things for evolution to change if it's fitness-increasing. (Changing size is a lot easier than developing an organ from scratch, that's for sure. Size is a tweak.)<br/><br/>These are only my notes for the first 80 pages. After that, I gave up and read on in a sort of stunned state. At least it does deign to include some sort of references (although it doesn't link specific claims to specific papers, seems kind of skimpy, and is very heavy on books - which aren't very useful in the sense that now you have an entire book to read just to check a few claims).<br/><br/>It helps that I've read up on many of the same topics for entirely different reasons, so I have a good idea of the general framework of various fields and where they're making huge extrapolations or passing over contrary evidence. 'What is good in it is not original, and what is original is not good.'<br/><br/>The disturbing thing for me is that so many of the references and facts are familiar, and it's written fairly well. I'm reminded of Anatole France:<br/><br/><blockquote>What frightens us most in a madman is his sane conversation.</blockquote>

Delany                 ★        2001   2009/01/01   A turgid incomprehensible mess which I abandoned after 200 pages. Delany seems to be of the opinion that great literature is meaningless and shocking (and long), and so the more deviant sex and violence the better. Looking at the positive reviews, I am reminded of a sarcastic comment by Karl Popper: "'I did not understand a word; but <i>I know: this is philosophy</i>' was the deep conviction of a highly gifted young physicist after he had heard Martin Heidegger speak." Similarly for <i>Dhalgren</i>: the emperor has no clothes, but that's a very gay thing to do and so he is feted and admired as shocking and edgy - if people don't like it, it must be good!<br/><br/>The most I can say for it is that it seems to evoke well middle-class New Yorkers' fears about the increasing crime rate portending a descent into violent anarchy & the 'concrete jungle'.

I found this rampant nepotism and an example of how media success is not a meritocracy, but I decided I should read the book before I jumped to negative conclusions about it being a bad fantasy book whose success represents the triumph of luck & marketing - after all, maybe the dude <i>was</i> a prodigy. So I read it and.... it was a bad fantasy book: the writing was clearly immature & inexperienced, and the setting/plot practically plagiarized Tolkien in a number of places. The author is no Brandon Sanderson, to be sure. Even the Sword of Shannara pulp fantasy series is better.

# Visual novels
## _Umineko no Naku Koro ni_
### Background

One of the anime I enjoy a lot is _[Higurashi When They Cry](!Wikipedia)_: a time-loop mystery/fantasy series with hefty helpings of gore and the tried-and-true anime formula of luring the viewer in with comedy and sentimentality, then knocking them for a loop with drama & tragedy. (Other exemplars of this strategy are _Fullmetal Alchemist_ and _Clannad_.) I was intrigued to learn that the writer of the original [visual novels](!Wikipedia), [07th Expansion](!Wikipedia) (Ryukishi07), actually had another mystery/fantasy series which was even longer and in some circles more highly regarded: _[Umineko: When They Cry](!Wikipedia)_. There was an anime but I was reassured that it was wretched and the palest reflection of the visual novels. Among anime fans, visual novel fans tend to be the nerdiest and to frequently claim that, while many popular anime were adapted from VNs, the VNs were longer and superior to the adaptations. I've seen too many book/movie pairs in Western media where this was also true to simply discount their claims, and I thought that _Umineko_ might be a good way to dip my toes into the VN waters. And if _Umineko_ was crap, I didn't have to deal with complaints that I had not given it a fair try since everyone agreed the VN was not jut a little bit better than the _Umineko_ anime, but far better. But I kept putting it off since there was no particular reason to read _Umineko_ at any point in time.

In June/July 2013, [Tuxedage](http://lesswrong.com/user/Tuxedage/overview/) disappeared from IRC for a few weeks and returned on 8 July 2013, reporting he had been paralyzed for the past two weeks by "a dark pit" - finishing the newest version of _Umineko_ with improved graphics - and describing it as "mind-screwy" and saying, "On one hand it's pure awesome. On the other hand, I kept going "What the fuck did I just read" the entire novel. Even until the end..._Umineko_ is such a screwed up story that I'm still trying to unravel my head around it. I'm watching [10-hour-long videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHMta4YbjSM "Umineko Chiru Explained - Part 1 - Against the 'official explanation'") attempting to explain what the heck happened in the novel", even more so than _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ (which [I love](/tags/NGE)). I like mind-screwy stuff a lot (like Eco's _[Foucault's Pendulum](!Wikipedia)_, or most of [Gene Wolfe](!Wikipedia)'s work), I liked _Higurashi_, a new graphics set sounded like a good time, I was not in the middle of watching any anime (having just finished the short _Little Reimu_) nor reading any books (I was mostly focused on transcribing [_Radiance_](/docs/2002-radiance)), and Tuxedage's opinions seem reliable... so why not start now?

I hopped on my usual torrent site `Nyaa.eu` to download it ([1-4](http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&tid=395795 "[Fuwanovel] Umineko no Naku Koro ni 1-4 (PS3 Sprites + Voices)"), [5-8](http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&tid=353745 "[Fuwanovel] Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru 5-8 (eng)")). I'd seen screenshots of the original artwork, and they are Touhou-levels of ugly; actually, the first time I happened to see them, I assumed they were someone's MS Paint-style parodies of the actual _Umineko_ artwork. Thank god for the new artwork! I would have torn out my eyes if I had had to look at the original artwork the entire time. I downloaded it, ran it in WINE without problem, and on 15 July 2013, began playing it...

From a technical perspective, the experience left something to be desired: a small narrow fixed-size window, which could fit relatively little dialogue and made matters more tiring than they had to be. The cramped window and tedium of having to constantly hit the spacebar to advance lines aside (I wish I could just tell it 'my reading speed is 400WPM, please advance at that rate automatically except for dialogue'; visual novels seem to have the worst of both worlds of novels & anime, where they show as little information as a screen of an anime yet still force you to choose your own pacing without interaction being as easy as a novel where you read an entire page before needing to take any physical action), I'm enjoying it. But none of this was a fatal problem, and the voice acting and limited animation did seem to add something to the experience over flat text. I don't regret reading it, although I'm not sure I will be tackling any visual novels in the near future. (Tuxedage says that _[Muv-Luv Alternative](!Wikipedia)_ is almost as good as _Umineko_, and it's ranked much higher than _Umineko on the [Visual Novel Database](http://vndb.org/v/all?q=;fil=tagspoil-1;o=d;s=rating) at #1 of all time vs #8; but he cautions it requires a time investment of >30 hours to get the payoff and I'm not sure I have it in me to run another marathon after _Umineko_, no matter how rewarding it was.)

### Review

After [~64 hours](#time-investment) of reading time, on 21 September 2013, I finally struggled out the other end.

Tuxedage was right, it was mind-screwy; and awesome, and awful. It was long, intricate, baffling, a gorgeously flawed achievement. Everyone should read it; no one should read it. I still don't know what to think of it. Is it ridiculous self-indulgent tripe which exposes my own mush-headedness, or the deepest mystery I will ever read? Or does it wander between the two, tracing the cartography of Ryukishi07's own life including the unexpected death of his fellow member of 07th Expansion & best friend BT, and, as one person in a [4chan discussion](https://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/72391938/) put it:

> _Umineko_ is a good editor away from being one of the most interesting VNs in recent memory. The thing is that the story was often times tedious and it got bogged down in the details. I'm pretty sure that if a professional writer streamlined it and cut out some of the heavy handed metaphors and over dramatic declarations of love the thing would be very fucking good.

I find it plausible that Ryukishi07 may never surpass _Umineko_. (I would analogize _Higurashi_ and _Umineko_ as similar to _[RahXephon](!Wikipedia)_ and _Evangelion_: the former is, in many respects, a more competently done and solid work, with excellence in all areas from music to artwork to plot to overall conception, without the large flaws and stylistic choices that make many people cringe away from or even hate from the latter; but nevertheless, the lightning struck the latter, those who have consumed the latter may never forget it, and it is easy to predict which will still be debated and watched decades later.)

[Renall](http://forums.animesuki.com/showpost.php?p=3996631&postcount=387) is, I think, a little too harsh on _Umineko_ when he writes

> I'm fascinated by the raw material he [Ryukishi07] works with and the creativity in his expression, but much like the artwork he draws, when I examine it even casually I find it to be full of flaws, corner-cutting, and laziness which detracts from the brilliance that occasionally shows through.
>
> Flaws like characterization issues, redundant writing, excessive description that bogs down scenes that are supposed to be taut and quickly-paced. Corner-cutting like not hiring an artist or editor, changing things to assuage the audience, or not generally acting like the professional that - "doujin work" label or not - he must conduct himself as. Laziness like plot threads and red herrings never addressed and major themes introduced and not adequately developed. I think these things, rather than malice or cynicism, contributed to the schizoid impression of his message and his overall quality that some readers have found.
>
> I like the *story*, but I do not like the *work*. I like the *style* of his character design, but I do not like the *implementation* in the actual sprites. I like the *characters* but I do not like their *development* (or lack thereof). It's like he's a miner who found a cache of gorgeous natural rubies, and rather than do the best he can to ensure that they are cut into the most jaw-dropping gemstones anyone has seen in centuries, he tries to do everything himself and produces a bunch of small, amateurishly-cut stones that are generally regarded as a waste of raw material.
>
> I'd love more than anything to see those things shine. But he is not a competent enough craftsman by himself, and until he starts to conduct himself professionally he never will be.
>
> I think [Type-Moon](!Wikipedia) is actually a good example of contrast. They became more professional over time and their craftsmanship improved *even if* their actual content did not. The _[Kara no Kyoukai](!Wikipedia)_ films are gorgeous and brilliantly-realized, they're just the nonsense scribblings of a highschooler who played way too much _[Mage: The Ascension](!Wikipedia)_. Ryukishi07 has better ideas, but he isn't professional at all. It disappoints me far more to see a good idea wasted by laziness than a terrible idea lavished with love and care. A brilliantly-cut piece of cheap artificial crystalware shines more brightly than a scuffed and amateurish ruby, but it's the latter you wish had the cut of the former, as then you could throw the other one away.

But I have to admit, there is truth to his critique. For every high, there is a low.

#### Plot

I am not going to try to summarize or describe the plot beyond what I have already, and the analysis in another section. I went into _Umineko_ knowing essentially knowing beyond "there are murders and a witch and seagulls". This meant I was shocked and betrayed by some of the developments, but also that I had no preconceptions or knowledge about any theories or debates. I think probably this is the best way to view works of this type. If you are on the fence, perhaps you should decide now and come back afterwards. I will not be marking spoilers or ROT-13ing passages.

One of the things that hooked me about the plot was how Ryukishi07 could throw in interesting ideas on top of the various mysteries. In episode 8, one of the puzzles for the reader is nothing less than the [Monty Hall paradox](!Wikipedia) with a decent explanation of subjective probability. In episode 1, we are given "chessboard thinking", a memorable metaphor for adversarial reasoning (touching on topics like [minimax](!Wikipedia) play and game theory). Not long after that, we see [Hempel's raven paradox](!Wikipedia) - used correctly and meaningfully! I was impressed. I learned the term [devil's proof](!Wikipedia) too, from _Umineko_, and that is a useful name to know for expressing an idea about proving negatives and impossibly high burdens of proof. Some of the puzzles tie in with classic attacks or tricks from elsewhere (I came up with a solution to one puzzle due to knowledge of [hash precommitments](!Wikipedia), and [a little poll suggests](http://lesswrong.com/lw/icj/open_thread_august_1925_2013/9mxe) that cryptography knowledge may help with solving puzzles). Kinzo's eerie business "luck" turns out to be essentially a [quantum suicide](!Wikipedia)/[lottery](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1t0/shock_level_5_big_worlds_and_modal_realism/21ze). The "magic" system elaborated by Ange and Maria (for characters like the Seven Sisters or Sakutarou) may seem opaque as mud, but when one thinks about daydreams, meditative/psychological practices of creating [tulpa](!Wikipedia)s (see [references](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/jf3/tulpa_referencesdiscussion/)), and one looks at the charismatic Christian methods for "hearing God" described in [Luhrmann's _When God Talks Back_](Mistakes#fn14), then it becomes much clearer and much less nonsensical/moronic, and the work that much richer.

One thing I found interesting about the plot was how little blame there is. ("Blaming someone was not the point of my work, and I don't want anyone to think that it ever was.") In this respect, it reminds me of Ghibli movies and Hayao Miyazaki. No country is entirely good or evil, it seems, although this has the necessary corollary that your opinions of "good" characters may well sink over the course of the story (Rosa: Worst Mom Ever; Kinzo: Worst Dad Ever). The story is indeed concerned with the "heart" of many characters. I particularly liked Erika Furudo and still catch myself occasionally thinking quotes from her.

But I must speak of the bad as well as good. It's not that post-episode 5 or so, _Umineko_ starts becoming very silly indeed; I didn't mind although a lot of people do. (I more minded how the silly "battles" wasted my time with repetitive junk.) Those parts are essentially a very drawn-out epilogue, a recap of the themes, left to clear up the mysteries for those of us who are not geniuses. Erika as pirate-ship captain? Why not.

The real problem is in the core episodes 1-4 or so. When _Umineko_ starts, we are plunged into the plot with no frame story. This is revealed to be a sub-story with a meta-Battler contending with Beatrice the Golden Witch about whether she can force him to acknowledge her & her magic and be fully resurrected into the mortal world. Good, fine. This explains the magic we see on screen just fine, and makes for a very interesting problem: how can our protagonist Battler refute magic, maintaining his disbelief, and eventually turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy as Beatrice is defeated and her magic collapses? Not too well, it turns out, and things only get worse for Battler as we see ever more magic on screen. Eventually, [I](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8c/august_2013_media_thread/9ior) [wrote](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8c/august_2013_media_thread/9ipa?context=1#9ipa) that the case against Battler was starting to seem *too* strong:

> I happened to read ANN's review of the second volume of the _Umineko_ manga and apparently the author remarks that most readers will be convinced that it's all supernatural and inexplicable (implying that it'll turn out to be like _Higurashi_, with naturalistic explanations for (almost) all the events) - which makes me angry since in the dozens of hours I've spent reading this, I was pretty sure that we were being shown all the events from third-person omniscient perspective, and one of the narrative rules of [third-person omniscient](!Wikipedia) is that you *don't lie to the reader*, and we see *plenty* of supernatural events from the omniscient perspective.
>
> ...What I'm worried about is that we're going to be told that the goats, the lightsabers, the parties at the end, the tea parties in another dimension, Rosa being fed her siblings - all the supernatural events *we are shown, not told about*, in which there's no need for misleading inference or mistaken assumptions or interpretations - will be somehow waved away like 'it was all a dream!' and I'll be mocked by the author for being so gullible as to believe what I saw on the screen.

If this turned out to be the case, I felt it would be a deep break of the contract between reader and writer: that *the reader can trust what he has read or seen*. The reader may make an unwarranted inference or interpretation, the reader may choose to ignore framing effects indicating that something is unreliable (for example, if a character read from a diary and it's visualized on screen, we understand that the diary author may be misleading, misled, the diary a forgery, etc), but otherwise, we can trust what we see. Otherwise, the fiction enterprise falls to pieces. There can be no story where there is no trust. Since fiction is, when you get right down to it, merely particularly "gripping lies", too much lying can blow a work to smithereens. It's very dangerous for a writer to take the cliched tactic "it was all a dream" because it threatens the basic integrity of the communication between writer and reader. I *thought* I could trust Ryukishi07 to not pull a jerkwad move like that, given that in _Umineko_ itself he takes pains to introduce [Knox's Decalogue](!Wikipedia) which was a mystery-genre solution to hack writers undermining the integrity of mysteries with impossible and unsatisfying "solutions".

Then in episode 4 with the revelation that Kinzo had been dead even in episode 1 (which spent hours on Kinzo dialogue and scenes), this is *exactly* what happened. _Umineko_ even quasi-breaks the fourth wall to mock you for believing anything you had seen on screen. I had no words that day to express my anger: (╯°□°）╯ ┻━┻ ...And then, as if that was not enough, we readers get collectively mocked (quite unfairly) some more in the final episode by Ryukishi07.

This 'treachery of images' substantially damaged _Umineko_ for me. Ryukishi07, you cannot feed me "it was all a story a character was writing" and expect me to intellectually engage with it as a mystery, when you have violated the most basic contract between reader and writer: I no longer trust you about anything, much less things like Knox's Decalogue or creating soluble mysteries, and I am certainly not going to invest any mental effort into trying to solve your mysteries before the end. When I was reading _[The Tokyo Zodiac Murders](!Wikipedia)_, I did spend some time trying to figure out the answer for myself, but that was because the author [Soji Shimada](!Wikipedia) played it straight with me the entire time, and I had to admit that his solution was fairly done. In retrospect, with the skeleton key to _Umineko_ of Shkanontrice, I do admit that a lot of the mysteries had reasonable solutions and it is a satisfying overall resolution. But I find the work flawed in that no one could figure out the mystery before all was laid bare in the final episodes. In this respect, _Umineko_ was a bad mystery and an object lesson in why one does not violate [Van Dine's second rule](http://umineko.wikia.com/wiki/Van_Dine%27s_Commandments): "No willful tricks or deceptions may be placed on the reader other than those played legitimately by the criminal on the detective himself."

(One might wonder about the riddle/epitaph that is such a MacGuffin, did that bother me? Perhaps surprisingly, not at all: I guessed immediately that it was going to be some stupid kanji-related trick which I didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of solving, and I didn't spare a thought for it. I was maliciously amused when the solution was explained as some ludicrous riddle involving Taiwan of all places and abandoned train stations, and it became clear that Japanese readers hadn't stood the slightest chance of solving it either and it was the equivalent of a Sherlock Holmes mystery[^Taiwan].)

[^Taiwan]: Apparently one Japanese who actually was living in Taiwan *almost* solved it; from [a post-_Umineko_ interview](https://seizonsha.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/%E6%9C%80%E7%B5%82%E8%80%83%E5%AF%9F%E3%80%80%E3%81%86%E3%81%BF%E3%81%AD%E3%81%93%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8F%E9%A0%83%E3%81%AB-answer-to-the-golden-witch-special-discussion/):

    > `KEIYA`: I have heard and researched a little about that person who solved the epitaph, it seems it was someone who did a homestay in Taiwan, right‽
    >
    > `Ryukishi07`: It seems like that. I have a faint memory of reading something like "I am overbroad in Taiwan right now". But, even those this theory was basically the correct answer, it was still following another popular main theory. It's really like in Umineko itself, isn't it?! I thought to myself that this was actually close to the final answer of the riddle that I wanted to give in the main Episodes, but even though there are many followers, there were as many people who wouldn't believe it and kept searching for alternatives saying, "I don't buy it, let's look at it differently!".

#### Solution

What's the real "Single Truth" of what happened on Rokkenjima? As I was fully expecting given the whole magic/willful-blindness theme hammered in again and again, despite the whole book MacGuffin, we never find out for sure. But like Ange's ending and ultimately Yasu's story, I think it's easily inferred what the true events were.  Let's consider what we know:

1. events must be consistent with future observations (future witches operate within the factual constraints set down by the past witches):

    - Battler's body must be alive, probably via the submarine base
    - Eva must be alive, via Kuwadorian (the police would have checked its existence as one of the few things they *could* check); Eva should also not be the culprit inasmuch as her beloved George is dead
    - the island must be blown up
    - Beatrice must not have killed anyone (at least, I think - IIRC, Virgilia gives this as a red truth in episode 4 or something)
    - they must motivate Eva to never reveal the truth even as the ugliest possible rumors swirl in the media; see Ryukishi07's [post-_Umineko_ interview](https://seizonsha.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/%E6%9C%80%E7%B5%82%E8%80%83%E5%AF%9F%E3%80%80%E3%81%86%E3%81%BF%E3%81%AD%E3%81%93%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8F%E9%A0%83%E3%81%AB-answer-to-the-golden-witch-special-discussion/) discussion of what we *can* infer about the real events (comments starting with "One of the things that you can really know from within the story is that 'Eva knew something but decided to never to tell Ange about it.'")
    - they must also motivate Eva to loathe & despise Ange (rather than, say, passionately devote herself to Ange as the last Ushiromiya and all she has left now that her immediate & extended family are all dead)
    - the culprit must die; in the post-Rokkenjima world, _shikata ga nai_ - there is no longer any guilty party to hunt down or punish. Only Ange's possibly self-destructive quest for the truth.
    - they must inspire complete revulsion and horror and denial in Ange & Toya/amnesiac-Battler when they learn/remember the truth
    - it must resemble the later episodes penned by Toya/amnesiac-Battler as he worked through his fragmented nightmarish memories; not necessarily in its entirety, but aspects of the truth must be reflected in the various episodes - the setup and motivations in the early episodes penned by Yasu, and facets of what actually happened in Toya's episodes

        - for example, he failed to figure out the culprit in time and Yasu died on the island
        - in particular, we see his memories involve bloodshed and murder; this rules out eg. any peaceful 'oops we accidentally set us up the bomb' scenarios
2. it cannot match the first two episodes since those were penned in advance of the events
3. the truth should be thematically consistent: just as the truth about Yasu prompts a devastating re-evaluation of the series, so too should the true events at least be shaking.

    One pattern in _Umineko_ is that however bad we think the facts are, they're *worse*.

    However ruthless we think Kyrie is early on, she's much worse (a self-admitted would-be murderess). However abusive we initially think Rosa is of Maria, it turns out to be worse. We think poorly of Kinzo for imprisoning Beatrice Junior and callously disregarding his childrens' welfare, but the incestuous & explosive truth is much worse. Whatever we assumed the process of getting the Nazi gold entailed, the origins turn out to be much bloodier than we imagined. Whatever we thought of Rudolf as a playboy, we probably did not guess about his infidelity, child-swapping/fake-stillbirth, driving people to suicide, having Yakuza ties, etc. However bad we think Kanon/Shannon's weird indebtedness to Kinzo and being 'furniture' is, when we finally figure out what being 'furniture' means, it's pretty bad. In Ange's 'trick' ending, it's already clear to us that Amakusa has been tasked with killing her, but the 'magic' ending emphasizes this by forcing a reset all the way back to the beginning of Ange's journey and Ange giving Okonogi her entire fortune - rather than the narratively-simpler strategy of just not going to Rokkenjima or the Sumaderas backing down when there. Yasu is screwed almost from birth, and we learn from Bernkastel that her rejection is almost guaranteed - and in the astronomically unlikely scenario she isn't rejected and grows up as "Lion", she dies young anyway.

    This isn't even a complete list of how bad things are, or how characters perpetuate their hatreds and fears and unhappiness as they abuse each other. Of course we see everyone at their worse, but that's a pretty lame defense inasmuch as it's like the murderer pointing out to the court how many days on which he never committed murder. In TvTropes terms, _Umineko_ is a [Crapsack World](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld). The Single Truth will be no exception to this.

With these criteria in mind, there is one story which fits perfectly and violates none of these requirements: the 'game' shown in episode 7 to Ange & Lion, in which the Ushiromiya adult siblings collectively solve the Epitaph, find the gold and learn about the bomb, fall out, and Kyrie & Rudolf systematically hunt down & murder everyone.

Episode 7 fits everything: we last know of Battler heading for the chapel right by the tunnel, so the first criteria is met (Battler flees to escape the murders); Eva knows about the bomb and Kuwadorian, so that's no issue; Beatrice's epitaph is solved so she never gets started killing; Eva is motivated to not reveal the truth since she accidentally started the killings (guilt) and cannot tell Ange that her mother was a mass murderer who did not love her & her father was no better & and her big brother was an accomplice (as far as Eva would know); Eva would also be reminded of the murderers who cold-bloodedly killed her husband & son every time she looked at Ange, explaining her hatred of Ange mingled with pride & love in keeping the truth from Ange; while he knows he's at least innocent, Battler would be little happier about the truth than Eva and likewise doesn't wish Ange to find out; the use of the tunnels and Kinzo's 'test', among other things, echoes the later episodes; murder is definitely involved; it is completely different from the first two episodes; and it's pretty revolting.

With episode 7 in mind, we can observe further reasons: Bernkastel says that she showed Ange that fragment to gauge her ability to handle the truth, and after Ange fails the test utterly (in a way very reminiscent of her reaction to actually learning the Single Truth in episode 8), strongly encourages her to go after the MacGuffin. Bernkastel being Bernkastel, it's a safe bet that whatever the Single Truth was, it was very close to the story Bernkastel showed. Further, we are told that Featherine is 'checking the answers'; given her literally cosmic experience with these stories and the overlap with Toya/amnesiac-Battler, it makes sense that her theory would be very close to the truth and also what we were being shown.

Finally and perhaps most compellingly, from an out-of-universe, it would make little sense for Ryukishi07 to *not* show us the true story (or something so close to it as to make no difference)! Throughout _Umineko_, he made a big deal out of characters choosing between "mystery" (the crushing reality of their lives in their crapsack worlds), or "magic" (self-protective delusions); why show us the truth so many times when characters must choose what to believe about smaller stories and incidents, and not give the reader the choice about the overall story? If he did not give us the choice, it would radically undermine the entire project.

#### Moral

The "magic"/"mystery" theme boils down to Ryukishi07 defending the self-delusion of magic. I strongly disagree with _Umineko_ and its theme. Magic corrupts oneself and frustrates action. The scenarios presented are revolting, and the clear message that we should forget about the past or evil when convenient. ("It is time to let bygones be bygones", a former Khmer Rouge [tells us](Sunk cost).) [Renall on AnimeSuki](http://forums.animesuki.com/showpost.php?p=3538751&postcount=260) calls a spade a spade:

> As far as we even know, Beatrice wasn't guilty of anything, so she doesn't even have to be forgiven for a murder if there was one. But *somebody* is. They can't be forgiven or condemned if that information is unknown.
>
> "Well some things are unknowable!"
>
> Okay, then evil won in _Umineko_. Evil. Won. And nobody cares because Beatrice and Battler were too selfish, because Eva was too selfish, because Ange was too selfish. Because no one actually cares about anyone but themselves. You ever notice how selfish and possessive so much of the "love" in _Umineko_ is? Hell, Yasu's love for Battler seems almost hopelessly selfish. The only person who loved unconditionally was Maria and we all see where that got her.
>
> So yeah, I can't condemn the culprit, but I guess I can condemn all the protagonists. They're terrible, terrible people. They are indirect agents of the culprit (presuming, again, there was one, and if there wasn't that should be known) and they ensured his or her victory. There's your precious "moral". Money and greed blind a person to the truth. *Love blinds people just as hard*. That may not be what he's saying directly, but that's what the text actually shows: Love and truth are in *direct opposition* in Ryukishi07's mind. What a deplorable state of affairs.

Even at the end, I found it incomprehensible how either the author or characters could expect anyone to forgive Yasu, even if they understood, and all she did was *try* to murder everyone as part of a suicide attempt. How much more so the actual antagonists?

The defense of the "magic" view is also ridiculously bad and completely undercuts the author's point: he could hardly have made a more convincing case *against* self-delusion if he tried, and offers us tons of examples where the [Litany of Gendlin](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin) should have been applied. When Ange, rejected by her schoolmates, dives into magic, she may feel better... at the cost of definitively alienating her classmates, blocking any rapprochement (not that she ever tried), and *directly* contributing to things like failing her exams (because she was so busy reading Maria's grimoire and visualizing her friends) and making her classmates angry at her. When Maria utters "~uuu", my reaction is not "poor Maria!" but "you are bringing this all down on yourself! If you would stop saying 'uuu', you would simultaneously stop getting beaten so much, have a chance at friends, and stop being so sad and lonely and despairing". (I was reading David Chapman's in-progress novel [_Buddhism for Vampires_](http://buddhism-for-vampires.com/) recently, and his [discussion of "black magic"](http://buddhism-for-vampires.com/black-magic-transformation) make the good point that such resentful self-protective magic can often be a crippling crutch.) Ryukishi07 emphasizes this even further by adding scenes where Rosa stonewalls a Child Protective Services agent and orders Maria to avoid other adults (like CPS) and lie and deceive to cover up the abusive truth. The reader cannot know whether Maria would be better off being taken away from Rosa entirely (and this is unknowable, what with it being a fictional work), but it is true that we also have no way of knowing for certain that Maria is best off enabling her mother's abuse - and certainly neither does Maria; and so her magic winds up being an opiate and one of the direct causes of her continued suffering when there were alternatives available.

I am reminded of _[End of Evangelion](!Wikipedia)_: EoE is notoriously opaque and confusing and debatable, but when you read through the script and the deleted scenes and contrast with the end of the TV series, the overall plot is actually fairly simple - Shinji has no reason to live and wants to die/merge with the human collective, then he changes his mind and resolves to live as a flawed separate being. Why the fuss? *Because his change of heart makes zero sense*. It is almost completely unmotivated, unexplained, and if _Umineko_ has a toxic crappy family, then the post-apocalyptic setting of the final scene of EoE is even more of a crapsack world (some Eva fans have debated whether, given the Giant Naked Rei corpse, it's even physically possible for Shinji & Asuka to survive more than a few weeks). This produces tremendous confusion as viewers inherently expect any such change of heart to at least be explained or argued for, not simply happen by fiat in a setting where the choice involves deeply distasteful consequences. But nevertheless, the text is clear, all materials support it, and the primary creator (Hideaki Anno) has said nothing to undermine the prima facie interpretation. However cathartic for the creators it was, and however pure an expression of their personal vision, can we call _Umineko_ or EoE true successes?

#### Music

The music was as good as the original artwork is bad, which is to say, pretty good; from this, I infer that they accidentally took their entire graphics budget and spent it on music. Below is a list of my favorites; most of these are from the games themselves (provided in OGG or WAV), but "Requiem" is from the [discography](http://bakabt.me/159362-umineko-no-naku-koro-ni-music-collection-flac.html):

### Appendices

While writing my review, I took two geeky detours: estimating how much time, exactly, it had taken me to read through _Umineko_; and how long is _Umineko_ compared to other works known for being incredibly long like Robert Jordan's _[The Wheel of Time](!Wikipedia)_ (which I have also read)?

#### Time investment

How much time did I spend reading through _Umineko_ and then reading about it online? I can get my total time investment from [arbtt](http://arbtt.nomeata.de/#what), by adding the classification rule:

~~~
current window $title =~ /.*mineko.*/ ==> tag Umineko,
~~~

And then running these queries (I need to do 2 because sometime in July, a log entry was corrupted and as part of the recovery I stored all the previous logs in a separate file):

~~~{.Bash}
$ arbtt-stats --only=Umineko
Total time per tag
____Tag_|_________Time_|_Percentage_
Umineko |  1d01h00m40s |     100.00
    WWW |     3h21m20s |      13.42

$ arbtt-stats --logfile=doc/arbtt/2012-2013.log  --only=Umineko
Total time per tag
____Tag_|_________Time_|_Percentage_
Umineko |  1d13h06m12s |     100.00
    WWW |       51m52s |       2.33
~~~

26 + 25 + 13 = 64 hours. (This excludes any time spent talking about it on IRC or LW.)

#### Textual length/complexity

_Umineko_ is really long and complex. The total has been estimated at 1.3 million words, there's something like 63 characters spread over at least 12 discrete storytelling units, with 7 or more different scenarios played out. I was curious how it compared.

A simple word count is not necessarily appropriate: the script is mostly dialogue, which is repetitive compared to your normal novel. In the spirit of the [Hutter Prize](http://prize.hutter1.net/) & Burfoot's ["Notes on a New Philosophy of Empirical Science"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5466), a better way might be to approximate the entropy of the various works by examining their *compressed* sizes. (Another example of this approach is [comparing _Dubliners_ to _Ulysses_](http://www.joyofdata.de/blog/relation-of-word-order-and-compression-ratio/ "Relation of Word Order and Compression Ratio and Degree of Structure").)

The most powerful general-purpose and widely-available lossless compression tool I know of is the [`xz`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz) implementation of [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) (`sudo apt-get install xz-utils`). It's not as good as the highly-tuned LZMA variants being used in the Hutter compression contest, but `xz` is the most powerful widely-available standard form of LZMA I know of and so it's a better choice than more familiar compression tools like `gzip`.

The _Umineko_ HTML scripts for episodes 1-6 (minus 7 and 8) are downloaded from the Internet Archive; the _Wheel of Time_ PDFs are downloaded from [Libgen](http://libgen.org/search.php?req=%22wheel+of+time%22) (except the last, _A Memory of Light_, which is apparently unavailable). We extract the text:

_WoT_ = 3928775; this is consistent with [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time#Books_in_the_series)'s overall estimate of 4056130 total words (if _AMoL_ is ~360k). So far so good.

Now let's do the compression and see:

~~~{.Bash}
for book in *
do
    echo "$book"

    echo "Gzip (min): "; cat $book | gzip -1 --stdout - | wc --bytes
    echo "Gzip (max): "; cat $book | gzip -9 --stdout - | wc --bytes

    ## commented out because bzip2 insists on printing junk which clutters the output
    # echo "Bzip2 (min): "; cat $book | bzip2 -1 --stdout --compress --quiet | wc --bytes
    # echo "Bzip2 (max): "; cat $book | bzip2 -9 --stdout --compress --quiet | wc --bytes

    echo "LZMA (min): "; cat $book | xz -0 --stdout | wc --bytes
    echo "LZMA (max): "; cat $book | xz -9 --extreme --stdout | wc --bytes
done
~~~

Output:

    shakespeare.txt
    Gzip (min):
    2347161
    Gzip (max):
    1967186
    LZMA (min):

    LZMA (max):
    1549296

    Gzip (min):

    LZMA (min):

_Umineko_ vs the compleat Shakespeare:

1427424 / 1549296 = 92%

Versus _WoT_:

1427424 / 5905940 = 24%

So we see that _Umineko_ contains somewhere around as much entropy as Shakespeare (Shakespeare is shorter, but harder to compress, as one expects), but for sheer bulk, can't compete with _WoT_, which makes sense to me: I don't think I could read _WoT_ in just 70 hours unless I skimmed a lot of it - those books are gargantuan!
