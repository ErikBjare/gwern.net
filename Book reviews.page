This is a sortable table of books I have read; it is compiled from a [CSV export](/docs/gwern-goodreads.csv) of [my Goodreads account](http://www.goodreads.com/gwern) to Markdown/HTML by [a Haskell script I wrote](/haskell/goodreadsToMarkdown.hs). (The GoodReads interface is too fancy for its own good.)

  *[I Am Legend](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1887368019&index=books "ISBN: 1887368019")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Richard Matheson                                  ★★★      1995
  *[Laws of Form](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=525475443&index=books "ISBN: 525475443")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             G. Spencer-Brown                                  ★★       1979
  *[An Island Out of Time: A Memoir of Smith Island in the Chesapeake](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=679781056&index=books "ISBN: 679781056")*                                                                                                                                                                                        Tom Horton                                        ★★★      1997
  *[The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=349104522&index=books "ISBN: 349104522")*                                                                                                                                                                                                Robert Kanigel                                    ★★★★     1992   2013/08/12   A long account of a short life. I knew only the bare outlines of Ramanujan's story, but I think this does an excellent job in fleshing the famous anecdotes out; for example, I hadn't realized how long he had twisted in the wind before his famous letter to Hardy, nor that he had spent a full year and more in India in a position before finally being brought to Cambridge. While Kanigel goes overboard in his novelistic scene-setting and psychologizing, one cannot say he does not try to set the scene for one and go beyond a bare recitations of events to the actual feel and texture of life in various places or of various persons; particularly noteworthy is his attempts to explain at least a little of the actual math which made Ramanujan worth a biography, beyond his romantic story, and here I think Kanigel does a really good job for the layman.
  *[Selected Poems: Summer Knowledge](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=811201910&index=books "ISBN: 811201910")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Delmore Schwartz                                           1967
  *[In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=811206807&index=books "ISBN: 811206807")*                                                                                                                                                                                                       Delmore Schwartz                                           1978
  *[The Dark Side of the Enlightenment: Wizards, Alchemists, and Spiritual Seekers in the Age of Reason](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=393079465&index=books "ISBN: 393079465")*                                                                                                                                                      John V Fleming                                    ★★★      2013   2013/08/09   The title might lead one to believe that Fleming is trying to show an inherent duality to science and the Enlightenment in general - its reliance on irrational methods or its oppression or inherent contradictions, say, perhaps an updated (and more factual) Foucault. But while it's a clever play on words, <i>The Dark Side of the Enlightenment</i> boils down to some short biographies of minor figures in Europe: the obscure English faith healer <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine_Greatrakes">Valentine Greatrakes</a>, the French <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsionnaires_of_Saint-M%C3%A9dard">Jansenists</a>, the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism#The_Rosicrucian_Enlightenment">Rosicrucians</a>, the Freemasons, <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Cagliostro">Cagliostro</a>, and <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_von_Kr%C3%BCdener">Julie de Kruedener</a>. If one looks for any sort of demonstration of a duality to the Enlightenment, one will be disappointed, as all the examples seem amply explained by simply pointing out that alchemists and religious types and fraudsters have always existed, and the case studies simply show that the Enlightenment did not sweep them away instantaneously, lock stock and barrel; one is surprised to note Fleming's lack of emphasis on the more famous examples of the coexistence of religion & science, like Isaac Newton. Perhaps this is to ascribe a failure at goals that Fleming never aimed at, but regardless none of the sections are particularly compelling: while the Rosicrucian and Freemason sections seem like reasonable overviews of their subjects for people who don't know anything about the topic, Greatrakes and Kruedener left me completely bored and wondering why Fleming considered them interesting enough to write a good chunk of a book on them summarizing other people's books on them, and the Cagliostro section seems rather apologetic (although I have only seen passing references to Cagliostro before and know little about him).<br/><br/>Fleming's medievalist traits show in his resentment for the low modern opinion of the Dark Ages, which is a little amusing, and his predilection for using very old and obscure books as sources. But this is the cause of the best aspect of this book: Fleming's genuine appreciation that even in the Enlightenment, a great many people thought very differently than we do today, centuries later in a completely transformed age, and his attempt to lay out the forgotten background and bring home the difference in consciousness. For example, <a href"https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/LEW7iWpd4a9">Fleming points out the absurdity</a> of claiming that Milton either subconsciously or consciously wrote <i>Paradise Lost</i> with the Devil as admirable, given the intense religious convictions of that age and Milton's own strong beliefs, and he does a credible job of conveying how so many Europeans and Catholics could seriously and factually believe that Napoleon Bonaparte was the literal Anti-Christ foretold by John in <i>Revelations</i> who would usher in the end of the world and sketching the <i>gematria</i>-based arguments Christian occultists concocted to 'prove' this. Getting in the "mind" of past ages is always hard, and I appreciate any author who gives me a little insight, even if much of the rest of his book left me feeling like I was wasting my time.
  *[Vader's Little Princess](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1452118698&index=books "ISBN: 1452118698")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Jeffrey Brown                                     ★★★      2013   2013/08/02   Cute, but superficial as intended. The main appeal of this for me was seeing just how many classic <i>Star Wars</i> lines or scenes could be twisted into hoary stereotypical teen jokes - it was many more than I would have expected!
  *[Tombstone: The Untold Story of Mao's Great Famine](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=184614518&index=books "ISBN: 184614518")*                                                                                                                                                                                                        Yang Jisheng                                      ★★★★     2012   2013/08/08   The statistics and anecdotes are fairly horrifying, and the sheer profusion drills in how widespread the famine was. But for me, the most fascinating part of <i>Tombstone</i> was how the vast Chinese government hierarchy rippled policies and misinformation up and down it - how the local cadres tried to bow to the demands they were hearing from higher up, how the higher ups took the falsified statistics and claims often at face value, and how the highest officials in Beijing seem almost childishly helpless as they stagger between skepticism of reports given them and unthinking acceptance of positive results. Mao particularly comes to mind in his constant swerving between "left deviationism" and "right deviationism" as he tries to get communal kitchens to work and takes at face value the harvest figures and "sputniks" (even as in other incidents, he scoffs at a local official, telling him flat out that such yields were simply impossible), as he is flattered by under-officials; despite his information problems, he astonishingly repeatedly engages in tactics of announcing liberal discussion and then brutally punishing anyone who was foolish enough to do aught but flatter Mao and his policies. Indeed, as Jisheng says, officials were placed into a situation of 'slaves to those above, tyrants to those below' (or however his phrase went).<br/><br/>With such perverse incentives, it's no surprise that we run into such perfectly Hayekian examples as 'deep plowing' or 'sputniks' or 'close planting' or the failure of communes to realize any gains of scale (and did realize diseconomies, like the example of how communes needed lumber to fire their large ovens/stoves rather than the little bits of grass individual households could use).<br/><br/>What is surprising is how effective the Chinese government was in maintaining control despite these severe systemic problems. How could so many millions starve to death, and no province rise up in rebellion? How could the revolts be so small scale, when the abuses were so bad and the death tolls large fractions of entire local populations? How did emigration not overwhelm any checks set up? It's easy to agree that Sen is basically right: Mao's famine could not have happened in any country with remotely democratic institutions like India, because the pressure would simply have overwhelmed any coercion the feeble government could orchestrate. But there's also a flip side here: Mao remarks with surprise 'how good' the Chinese people were, that he could summon millions and disperse them with a wave of his hand, and another high official says similarly that it is only the goodness of the people which prevented the Army from being called in. Jisheng is at pains to show that the Communist propaganda worked and the people were not uniformly cynical about the regime like the Russians at the end of the USSR were: many officials sacrificed their careers or lives for their people, high officials are routinely shocked when they return to their home villages, and throughout we see people who are in all seriousness convinced that all the faults stem from local or midlevel officials and if only they can get word to the Emperor in Beijing all will be made well. This naive faith, which initially strikes one as pathetic & moronic & lacking any critical thinking makes me wonder if it could also be related to how China seems to have vastly outperformed India in the past decades, since it switched to sane economic policies; if the Chinese people's faith and hard work could lead to such utter disaster when applied to futile policies, does it yield equally unusual results when finally applied correctly?
  *[Tau Zero](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=575077328&index=books "ISBN: 575077328")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Poul Anderson                                     ★★★      2006   2013/08/10   The single central conceit is outstanding and excellent hard SF, an interesting entry in what one might call 'time dilation horror'; there's only one central idea, however, which becomes strained with repetition over the length of the novel (as short as it is), and while I appreciate that Anderson tried to leaven the hard SF with real characters and interpersonal drama, I can't say he succeeded.<br/><br/>For punch, some of Larry Niven's Known Universe short stories using ramjets may be better (<a href"http://worldtracker.org/media/library/English%20Literature/L/Larry%20Niven/Larry%20Niven%20-%20A%20Hole%20In%20Space%20v1.0.htm">"Rammer"</a> and <a href"http://worldtracker.org/media/library/English%20Literature/N/Niven,%20Larry/SHORT%20STORY%20collections/Neutron%20Star/Neutron.Star_coll.txt">"The Ethics of Madness"</a> come to mind) and I would be remiss to not mention Peter Watts's <a href"http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_TheIsland.pdf">"The Island"</a> (suggested soundtrack: Cloud Cult's <a href"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udWIFQgAcYQ">"There's So Much Energy In Us"</a>), although <i>Tau Zero</i> is much more ambitious.
  *[The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=739303406&index=books "ISBN: 739303406")*                                                                                                                                                                 Erik Larson                                       ★★★★     2003   2013/07/25   Two books in one: a relatively uninteresting psychopathic serial killer (I agree with Larson, anyone who's read Cleckley will instantly see Holmes as a psychopath), and the other a very interesting portrait of a completely forgotten societal phenomenon - world fairs & expositions. They used to be so important, major matters of national prestige, key mechanisms in the spread of art (especially Japanese art, at the Paris one) and technology, and yet, they are completely forgotten; I hadn't even heard of them until they came up in *Men in Black* because some leftover buildings got used in the movie. But as Larson tells the story, we learn that they were mega-events to which all celebrities attended, and a good fraction of the entire American population would attend; they were the originals of which Disney's Epcot is the palest imitation, they were the reason we have the Eiffel Tower and the Ferris wheel and so many other things. This story is the fascinating story, and it's almost a pity that Larson periodically interrupts the tale of the Chicago one to tell us more about Holmes, rather than giving us real photos and more stories from the fair (photos like those in Appelbaum's *The Chicago World's Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record*): after all we are told about the Court of Honor, it's sad to be given only a tiny glimpse of it, and it's really a pity we read only a few 'con stories', as it were, from the event itself. But so it goes.
  *[The Chicago World's Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=48623990&index=books "ISBN: 48623990")*                                                                                                                                                                                                    Stanley Appelbaum                                 ★★★      1980   2013/08/07   As the other reviews say: worth it for the photographs, not so much the commentary. Some might be a little disappointed by the focus on the neo-classical prestige buildings and not parts us moderns would find of vastly more interest, like the first Ferris wheel, the first Japanese building in the US, Wild Bill's show, etc, but it's still much better than nothing.

He is constantly killing and being attacked, wenching his models, contracting hideous illnesses (or noting in passing the constant unexpected death of others), and being betrayed (by this account) or insulting others. It's an endless exhausting cycle such that even Cellini had to notice its futility and danger. One has to wonder how much he exaggerates: aside from the demonology and weather-controlling, it seems so routine for people to go around armed and attacking for minor insults and then dying of a scratch. Then there is his strange attitude to his patrons: on the one hand, he seems largely unable to criticize them or the system despite wallowing in their corruption and wealth (surely the King of France wasn't all *that*, and given the sheer servility & ignobility & criminality of the popes he deals with, his tolerance of them is astounding), but on the other hand, he almost goes out of his way to mess with them.<br/><br/>Well, it's fun in small doses, the constant tumult of Cellini's life suggests that the constant murder & assault & theft & large gifts we read of in picaresques or stories (like the Decameron) are much more realistic than we give them credit for, and it's pretty cool to look at the Wikipedia article and see images of the works he labors over at such length in his autobio.

If you can't get that perfect, then there's not much to it, and the irritating aspects of light novels come to the fore (very short, sketchy chapters, endings that feel almost rushed, etc).

As far as that goes, it's quite an interesting exercise and the source of a number of parodic versions of China/Japan, I suspect. I am not sure how many people are up to a entire sustained anthology of this, though: the stories are relatively flimsy and one can drown in the prose while losing track utterly of the plot and personages, which certainly is not calculated to create charm nor cheer in the consumer.

Dead is dead, and limited wars fought with 1kt neutron bombs which can't affect much past 1400 meters with minimal fallout sounds way better than dropping megatons on random megalopolises).<br/><br/>He had a seriously messed up childhood if half what he says is true, and one gets the disturbing feeling that he was a hardline right-wing hawk solely because he was beaten up as a kid by some other kids who were socialists, and his language about the War on Drugs is disturbingly emotionally laden and based on purity.<br/><br/>He seems to, like the Bourbons, 'have forgotten nothing and learned nothing' - his memoir might as well have been written back in the '60s, because he shows no awareness of why anyone would consider the War on Drugs a colossal folly, discusses freely how the first Gulf War was a disaster because Saddam could go right back to inventing missiles & WMDs (?! my online edition is dated 2006! Isn't some sort of appendix or footnote or corrigendum warranted like "oops I completely fucked up my beliefs, sorry!"?), talks paranoidly about Russian intentions and capabilities with almost no reference to post-Cold War developments or revelations which you think he would've been very interested in, and so on. (I don't think much of the *Wired* editor's appendix either; how does anyone sound 'erudite' when saying a perfectly ordinary sentence on the phone? You sound like you're kissing ass with absurd flattery like that. And the '90s boom wasn't due to the Cold War ending, it was due to Moore's law finally making computers & networks sufficiently cheap & powerful that they were worth a damn for anybody but geeks, etc.)<br/><br/>What is there to like? Well, he has some cute stories about the sloppy studies and research & development which went on back then, like the Minutemen silos which couldn't actually launch any when tested or about Herman Kahn's dishonest scare tactic studies or about the many compromises & sacrifices of intellectual honesty RAND staffers made. Those are fun. The part where he went to France and his explanation for the Vela incident was interesting.

Roach comes up with all the best quotes and stories, seems to have talked to everyone and done everything. And her running commentary is also hilarious - she's almost as funny as she thinks she is. I laughed many times reading the book.<br/><br/>This is definitely more "mind candy" than educational as it jumps from food to sex to hygiene to acceleration issues to psychology without any overview or unifying ideas or concepts, although I did learn a fair bit anyway from the scattershot approach. (One chapter was a revelation for me in explaining why early science fiction often postulated space driving people insane: http://www.gwern.net/Sand\#scanners-live-in-vain-as-realistic-sf ). If there is any big picture to *Packing for Mars*, it's that outer space is *really* hard for humans to survive in and everyone & everything has to be studied in microscopic detail for anyone to go there and come back alive. Reading all the checks and modifications and details, one is boggled that we made it to the Moon, much less we be musing a Mars mission.<br/><br/>(It makes for a pretty compelling argument that humans just don't belong in space and that if we put half as much effort/time/money into automated exploration, we would know far more about the universe than we do - apparently, the ISS has cost us *\$150 billion* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Space\_Station\#Programme\_cost ‽ Roach is aware that this is the impression she gives in her conclusion where she criticizes 'simulations', but honestly, I didn't find it a very compelling defense of the enormous difficulties & costs of shooting up some monkeys to walk around Mars compared to just sending probes.)<br/><br/>I compiled some excerpts from most of the chapters:<br/><br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/jmWazbnemdz 1-2<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/UygTUTr6JxN 3<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/TCXnbJPsM4f 4-5<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Ri2n4YzMNkf 6-7<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/5YfPihkd2Bz 8<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/EZBkXDcU1Zs 9<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/cALb6LEWKx8 10<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Ksf8iYRutuL 11<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/BD5TZJTbwtE 12<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/LRBW1xsM2HU 13<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Y3UUadXni7i 14-15<br/>- https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/A3UtFXZbZtn endnotes

Did it yield any caliphates, say? Anarchistic self-governing communes? Self-governing city-states? Hanseatic Leagues? Or look at official rhetoric in places like China. Look at the gradual and continuing expansion of capitalism and democracy as the defaults for every country. Look at the discrediting of Putin's Russian cronyism approach, or at the Muslim world's shift away from marginal Salafist groups like al-Qaeda.<br/><br/>*Fukuyama was right. There are no credible alternatives to the capitalist liberal democracy paradigm.*

(To call it great, I'd want it to be harder alt history with more details about how a transatlantic tunnel could even work at all, wrapped into a more engrossing story.)
  *[Surface Detail (Culture, \#9)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=316123404&index=books "ISBN: 316123404")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Iain M. Banks                                     ★★★      2010   2011/07/20   The usual intertwined Banks plotting was easier to follow this time, and the overall resolution very satisfactory. Not as interesting as *Player of Games*, but still a solid Culture novel
  *[The Children of the Sky  (Zones of Thought \#3)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=312875622&index=books "ISBN: 312875622")*                                                                                                                                                                                                          Vernor Vinge                                      ★★★      2011   2011/11/01   As much as I like the Zones of Thought universe, this drags in the middle, Tine society isn't as interesting second time around, and it doesn't end the storyline.
  *[Everything Bad is Good for You](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1594481946&index=books "ISBN: 1594481946")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Steven Johnson                                    ★★★      2006   2011/11/03   I thought it was very short and not in depth at all; yeah, his handful of graphs of episodes was interesting from the data visualization viewpoint, but most of his arguments, such as they were, were qualitative and hand-wavey. (What, there are no simplistic shows these days?) The best I can say is: the thesis is not *obviously* impossible or wrong a priori, but needs a heck of a lot more empirical backing.
  *[Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=520248198&index=books "ISBN: 520248198")*                                                                                                                                                                                       Kathryn Edin                                      ★★★★     2007   2011/11/13   Incredibly sobering, explains a lot about inner-city illegitimacy, and the best thing I've read about the topic and why women would do something which from far away seems like a completely terrible idea.
  *[Snuff (Discworld, \#39)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=38561926&index=books "ISBN: 38561926")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Terry Pratchett                                   ★★★★     2011   2011/11/17   Curiously, this is the least funny but probably best Discworld book I've read so far. Vimes has grown a great deal since we first met him.
  *[Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=300102852&index=books "ISBN: 300102852")*                                                                                                                                                                                                     Takashi Murakami                                  ★★★★     2005   2011/11/24   Main use for this book: encyclopedia entries, Murakami's long essay, the dialogue with Okada - rest is completely impenetrable, featuring fine gobbledegook.
  *[The Closing of the American Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=671657151&index=books "ISBN: 671657151")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Allan Bloom                                       ★★★      1988   2011/11/27   More interesting than I expected (not just a conservative cliched curmudgeon) but ultimately leaves me mostly unmoved.
  *[When London Was Capital of America](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=300137397&index=books "ISBN: 300137397")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Julie Flavell                                     ★★       2010   2011/12/02   Bogged down by detailed focus on a tiny handful of Americans - so few, that one gets by the narrowness the impression there weren't *that* many American in London and the thesis is relatively bogus!
  *[After the Software Wars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=578011891&index=books "ISBN: 578011891")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Keith Cary Curtis                                 ★★       2009   2011/04/29   Disappointing. Simplistic, ideological, economically naive, littered with technical errors, uninformed by post-2005 developments...
  *[The Luck Factor: Changing Your Luck, Changing Your Life - The Four  Essential Principles](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=786869143&index=books "ISBN: 786869143")*                                                                                                                                                                 Richard Wiseman                                   ★★★      2003   2011/05/23   This book is almost too padded to be worth reading. Is there a condensed version anywhere? The ideas seem like they might have something to them, but it's hard to find the meat under the flab.
  *[Ragnarok](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1847670644&index=books "ISBN: 1847670644")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               A.S. Byatt                                        ★★★      2011   2011/10/19   Byatt's Norse is not mine; she writes very well, but to me, Norse myth is about the striking verse, the illuminating kenning, the weirdly powerful line, yoked to phantasmagoric unconnected incidents under the dark shadow of Wyrd... (Much shorter than expected.)
  *[The Circus of Dr. Lao](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=803269072&index=books "ISBN: 803269072")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Charles G. Finney                                 ★★★★     2002   2011/10/20   The book comes up often in Wolfe discussions of *An Evil guest*, I noticed there was a copy on library.nu, so...<br/><br/>Short, but fairly funny; ending wasn't quite as expected, but the dramatis personae and especially the section of questions listing contradictions/mistakes/obscurities made up for my lingering dissatisfaction. Don't think it was directly useful for interpreting Wolfe's *AEg*, but the dramatis personae is a clear inspiration for Wolfe's own character lists.
  *[Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=521290384&index=books "ISBN: 521290384")*                                                                                                                                                                                              Imre Lakatos                                      ★★★★     1976   2011/12/28   Surprisingly interesting, like Wittgenstein if he wrote in a human fashion, and longer than one would think possible given how straightforward the problem initially appears.
  *[Where China Meets India: Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=374299072&index=books "ISBN: 374299072")*                                                                                                                                                                                            Thant Myint-U                                     ★★       2011   2012/01/10   Potted histories a bit boring, case feels overstated, overall repetitious; most interesting bits are personal travels. It's also fairly outdated now due to the surprisingly opening up & democratizing of Myanmar.

I enjoyed it much less than *Hogfather*, which I read around the same time.

Needham), his takes on modern Chinese history is very interesting.
  *[The Night Land](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1587156040&index=books "ISBN: 1587156040")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         William Hope Hodgson                              ★★★      2001   2012/02/28   Very strange, studiedly & almost unreadably archaic, not really recommended except for the excellent early worldbuilding & evocation of the dying earth setting

I was really excited when the book was announced, since I hoped for expanded better version of his incredibly interesting paper/monograph "Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity" (http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf abstract: "...In particular, I argue that computational complexity theory - the field that studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve computational problems - leads to new perspectives on the nature of mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of logical omniscience, Hume's problem of induction, Goodman's grue riddle, the foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, closed timelike curves, and several other topics of philosophical interest. I end by discussing aspects of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis."), and see also his more recent "The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine" http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1438<br/><br/>The book turns out to be excellent, but not the 5-star universally-compelling, suitable for the layman & professional alike, complete coverage of all that is interesting about computational complexity and quantum I was hoping for. I'd say probably that one could get 80% of the value from reading "Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity", and even more if one is not particularly interested in computational complexity or quantum computing for their own sakes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- best book I've ever read on computational complexity<br/>- repeatedly throws out fascinating observations<br/>- learned a lot of new things even after years reading Aaronson's blog - PAC learning, Blum speedup theorem, Tarski's decision algorithm<br/>- humor better than expected<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- some key arguments are sketched out badly (eg. I don't know how anyone would understand Aaronson's version of Cantor's diagonal proof, compared to longer better-illustrated versions like Hofstadter's in *Godel, Escher, Bach*)<br/>- the complex-probability version of quantum mechanics didn't seem much more transparent to me than other versions; maybe if I had a physics degree<br/>- overuse of complexity zoo abbreviations<br/>- no discernible connection to Democritus or the Democritus quote<br/>- some later chapters highly technical and specialized and uninteresting (eg. the size of quantum states), not always meaningfully connected<br/>- Aaronson randomly inserts bizarre and sloppy anti-Bayesian digs - like at the end of his chapter on anthropics, he seems to think it refutes the 'religion' of Bayesianism. Dude, WTF? No one understands or agrees on anyone in anthropics, *that's the whole point of half the field*, and you want to use anthropics as an argument against Bayesianism‽ You want to disprove the eminently successful and practical by the useless and bizarre?

Borges is always interested in translation (see for example his fantastic essay on translating the <i>1001 Nights</i>) and I made a note to look up this work which presented such challenges for rendering into Spanish. (The actual edition I used was http://penelope.uchicago.edu/hydrionoframes/hydrion.html )<br/><br/><i>Urn Burial</i> is hugely archaic, but also amazing. I am not sure where I have last seen any literary pyrotechnics to match Browne in English. David Foster Wallace sometimes approaches him, but beyond that I draw blanks. The book defies any simple summary as many passages are cryptic tangles and Browne says many things. So I will not try, and simply present some passages that struck me:<br/><br/>

I already knew a lot of it from Lessig and related copyright books & writings, but Wu puts history together nicely, and renders the 2000s a little clearer ( that I really needed to be told that Apple/Jobs are a clear incarnation of the empire-building trend; this was obvious even when Stephenson pointed it out many years ago in "In The Beginning Was The Commandline..." http://pauillac.inria.fr/\~weis/info/commandline.html)

Desensitized by the end. Not sure how to take it, but disagree with the protagonist - I don't understand his constant depravity and murdering, and I don't agree I would do much the same thing in his position. One or two murders, maybe, but even killing his best friend Thomas who time and again saved Aue's ass?

  *[Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=385523904&index=books "ISBN: 385523904")*                                                                                                                                                                                                           Barbara Demick                                    ★★★★★    2009                Highly recommended. Probably the second best book I've read about North Korea, after B.R. Myer's *The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters*.
  *[Debt: The First 5,000 Years](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1933633867&index=books "ISBN: 1933633867")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                            David Graeber                                     ★★★★     2011                Mixed feelings: many interesting little tidbits and quotes, but overall I get the feel of a vast thesis made up of confirmation bias and unreliable evidence like etymologies; some parts are flabbergastingly wrong, like his brief description of Apple Computer's founding. And while he's very cynical about things he's against, he exhibits a strange lack of cynicism about his in-groups (like the idle poor, or China - accusing the US of manipulating the rates!) Emphasizing the rather ideological bent of the book is his very thin skin as exhibited in response to online criticism like on Crooked Timber.
  *[The Collapse of Complex Societies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=52138673&index=books "ISBN: 52138673")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Joseph Tainter                                    ★★★★★    1990                Very good: much better than Jared Diamond's *Collapse*, and much more convincing than Spengler or Toynbee.<br/>It was also deeply disturbing - the Ik amazed me in chapter 1, and the statistics in chapter 4 were extremely dismal and tie in far too well to Cowen's *The Great Stagnation* and Murray's *Human Accomplishment*. There are a great many datapoints suggesting that diminishing marginal returns to modern tech/science began sometime in the late 1800s/early 1900s...
  *[The Histories](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=140449086&index=books "ISBN: 140449086")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Herodotus                                         ★★★★★    2003                Decided to finally read Herodotus after I read Gene Wolfe's historical fantasy novel *Solder of Arete* which draws heavily on him, and then when I had to track down a quote on LessWrong.com to the exact Herodotus passage. Overall, far more interesting than I had expected. Surprisingly funny or interesting anecdotes. There is a superfusion of gods and oracles, which was curious - the oracles truly were treacherous! The Persian kings come off as remarkably capricious and destructive, even the good ones. And Herodotus has a strange capacity to skeptically reason well & sensibly and then be completely superstitious in the next passage. Having read about these ancient events many times, I found half the value was just seeing a thorough account from a single Greek's perspective.
  *[The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=805071342&index=books "ISBN: 805071342")*                                                                                                                                                                     David Salsburg                                    ★★       2002                Odd, not that great. Problem is, Salsburg can't decide whether he's writing a history, a collection of biographies, anecdotes, or explaining modern statistics (early, frequentist, and Bayesian) to a layman, and so it winds up being nothing in particular.<br/>If you want statistics history, I'm sure there are better starting points (McGrayne's *Theory That Would Not Die* being one that comes to mind).
  *[The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1400065453&index=books "ISBN: 1400065453")*                                                                                                                                                                                                                  David Mitchell                                    ★★★★★    2010                Finally got around to reading it. It was surprisingly unliterary and unpostmodern for Mitchell, but in exchange, he nailed the historical details and gave us an adventure which subverted many of the usual tropes - the raid on the nunnery was just a trap, the hero doesn't get the girl, his chief heroism was standing there to be shot at, and the man who takes down the big baddie is someone we thought to be entirely in the baddie's pocket. The supernatural aspects are implied to be genuine, but it's never resolved, which I am grateful for. It would ruin the feel.
  *[Policeman's Beard is Half-Constructed: Computer Prose and Poetry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=446380512&index=books "ISBN: 446380512")*                                                                                                                                                                                         Racter                                            ★★★      1984                Summary: the dreams quote in the Wikipedia article really was the most evocative part of the collection. Most of it wasn't worth reading, and extremely suspiciously sophisticated and likely written by Chamberlain, which reduces the novelty value.

  *[Left in the dark : the biological origins of the fall from grace : an investigation into the evolution of the human brain : a journey to the edge of the human mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=955678404&index=books "ISBN: 955678404")*                                                                                      Graham Gynn                                       ★        2008                Having seen an overview of the claims, I expected little from this book but I was hopeful that it could at least be "mind candy" in the same sense that I enjoyed tremendously reading Jayne's *Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind*. But having finished reading it, I'm disappointed. It's not fit to shine Jaynes's boot buckle; while Jaynes's theory has serious problems (explaining where bicameralism went, worldwide, and other chronological problems, for starters), it at least was an elegant theory that fit a great many facts!<br/><br/>Wright and his co-author, on the other hand, is chock-full of anecdotes (better ping-pong playing and relaxation playing with your left hand? really?); data seems misrepresented (I did not recognize his description of the peg data in the sleep deprivation experiment with the actual graph); dismissal of possibilities as 'implausible' which are perfectly plausible (the claim that testosterone can't damage one hemisphere and help the other comes to mind, as does the claim that there are no plausible evolutionary theories for evolving handedness - actually, there's a very elegant competition explanation which anyone who has done a head-to-head sport like ping-pong or fencing could appreciate); fully general counter-arguments like the claim that not appreciating the theory is evidence of being damaged as the theory predicts; excuse-making for the absence of forest fossils supporting their theory; blatantly false claims about bipedalism mixed in with distraction about the aquatic ape theory; claims about agricultural longevity which are surely the elementary mistake of assuming that infant mortality-dominated average lifespans say much about how adults actually lived; invocation of pseudoscience like photoreading or Carlos Castaneda or 140-year olds in distant Third World countries (seriously? seriously‽) or Alzheimers and other diseases being caused by dehydration; blatant confirmation bias\* (who, interested in people who do not sleep, would mention a Vietnamese woman and *not* mention fatal familial insomnia?); and of course, vitamin C megadoses must appear in any wnork by fruitarians, as does the claim that cooking reduces the nutritional value of food (which would come as news to anthropologists, who regard the introduction of fire as possibly the key breakthrough to enabling large expensive brains - except that right, the authors believe that *fruit* is what enabled large brains, hm, I wonder why they might not discuss the caloric value of cooking food... perhaps it's because cooked food doesn't 'raise micro-electric potentials throughout the body').<br/><br/>\* which becomes ever more important in data-rich noisy fields like psychology; I actually pointed this out for dual n-back recently on Hacker News: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4204653 and more generally: http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ\#flaws-in-mainstream-science-and-psychology<br/><br/>The use of autists, idiot savants, and TMS is an interesting topic in its own right, but inadvertently sabotages the thesis. There's a legal saying, 'hard cases make bad law'; in neuroscience, damaged patients make bad theories. The brain is Turing-complete and can exhibit arbitrarily complex problems: these patients tend to be fairly unique, and how are you going to build any kind of theory on them? To the extent we can infer anything, it's that there is a common trait among those with access to low-level processing: they are *not smart*. Their abilities seem to come at the expense of all other abilities or higher-level processing: Kim Peek may have memorized thousands of books, but what sort of understanding did this man with an IQ of 89 exhibit of them? Very little. The child prodigy artist may be able to render remarkably detailed artwork, but a camera is more accurate and just as artistic as I've ever heard him be. This does not bode well for any exaltation of the right hemisphere...<br/><br/>The crowning piece of nonsense is probably the 'loop' between fruits, steroids, and DNA. This idea, lovingly illustrated in multiple graphs, is fractal nonsense: the more you look at each piece, the worse it gets. It's as if someone told you that car evolution was steered by gas stations: you see, a human drives the car to a gas station, the car is filled up with gas, the gas changes the car, changing how it drives to the next gas station and how it reacts to the next fillup. This may initially seem plausible until you look at step 3, which reads basically like the old Far Side strip - 'And then a miracle happens'. How exactly do steroids rewrite the DNA? A steroid is not a little computer or nanobot which can go into a sperm or egg - and notice the quiet eliding of the difference between somatic and germ-line cells, it's perfectly possible for any genetic or epigenetic changes to not be passed on - and rewrite the DNA as it wishes. If variations in circulating levels of some chemical affect DNA, it must do so via receptors and proteins set up in advance by gradual evolution to do specific things - eg. think of how alligators or crocodiles vary the sex ratio of their offspring in response to ambient temperatures, this is set up in advance because it's useful, the temperature doesn't 'just cause' the sex ratio to vary in some magical way because boy alligators are fiery and analogous to hot weather while female crocodiles are chillier and aloof. (I'm reminded of the genie of the lamp: "I wish everyone was happy!" Well, OK, but what does that *actually* mean and how should the genie do it?) They are, naturally, as sure of this evolutionary loop as one can be in the complete absence of all evidence.<br/><br/>While we're on DNA, I was deeply amused that they could propose this system as their primary explanation, and then throughout the rest of the book dismiss any further adaptation because a few hundred thousand years was not enough! I really think that we can adapt to eating meat in a few hundred thousand years, especially when our primate ancestors and surviving lineages often do eat meat... It was especially funny to read "It is highly unlikely that the DNA selection process could have achieved this rapid result (certainly not on the savannah where hominids would be subjected to hard and stressful environmental conditions)"; hard and stressful conditions are exactly the kind of selection pressure that might drive large increases in any organ or body part, and allometric scaling in general is one of the easier things for evolution to change if it's fitness-increasing. (Changing size is a lot easier than developing an organ from scratch, that's for sure. Size is a tweak.)<br/><br/>These are only my notes for the first 80 pages. After that, I gave up and read on in a sort of stunned state. At least it does deign to include some sort of references (although it doesn't link specific claims to specific papers, seems kind of skimpy, and is very heavy on books - which aren't very useful in the sense that now you have an entire book to read just to check a few claims).<br/><br/>It helps that I've read up on many of the same topics for entirely different reasons, so I have a good idea of the general framework of various fields and where they're making huge extrapolations or passing over contrary evidence. 'What is good in it is not original, and what is original is not good.'<br/><br/>The disturbing thing for me is that so many of the references and facts are familiar, and it's written fairly well. I'm reminded of Anatole France:<br/><br/>\> What frightens us most in a madman is his sane conversation.

I enjoyed the book a lot; McGrayne has a good eye for the amusing details, and she conveys at least some of the intuition (although some graphs or examples would have helped the reader - I liked the flipping coin illustrations in Dasivia 2006 *Bayesian Data Analysis*). It's also remarkably synoptic: I was repeatedly surprised by names popping up in the chronology, like BUGS, Bretthorst, Fisher's smoking papers, Diaconis, the actuarial use of Bayes etc, and I have a better impression of Laplace and Good's many contributions. The math was very light, which undermines the value of much of it since unless one is already an expert one doesn't know how much the author is falsifying (for the best reasons), and means that some connections are missed (like empirical Bayes being a forerunner of hierarchical modeling, which aren't well-explained themselves).
  *[Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=30795191&index=books "ISBN: 30795191")*                                                                                                                                                                        Daniel Domscheit-Berg                             ★★★      2011                The writing is absolutely atrocious, although I don't know if this is due to the translation from the German or whether the co-author journalist screwed it all up. Domscheit comes off in some passages as too ignorant to even understand Assange's beliefs (for example, I seem to recall that there was an irritating passage where Domscheit mocks Assange's use of red light to help his sleep - even though this is completely standard biology, that blue light resets sleep cycles and keeps one awake!) Domscheit's personal failings are only highlighted by the complete and unmitigated failure of his 'OpenLeaks' project.<br/>It's also bizarrely lacking in technical details; probably also thanks to the journalist. Still, many interesting bits. I remember thinking way back that for a group claiming so many participants, it had an oddly low flow of leaks - which Domscheit says was because it was mostly him and Assange. Makes sense.<br/>I give it 3 stars solely because it is a unique primary source about WikiLeaks; if this was not from a principal player, it would not be worth reading.

Time and again, I was shocked to find subjects treated of keen interest to me, or which read like Pinker had taken some of my essays but done them way better (on terrorism, on the expanding circle, etc.); even so, I was surprised to learn new things (resource problems don't correlate well with violence?).<br/><br/>I initially thought I might excerpt some parts of it for an essay or article, but as the quotes kept piling up, I realized that it was hopeless. Reading reviews or discussions of it is not enough; Pinker just covers too much and rebuts too many possible criticisms. It's very long, as a result, but absorbing.

Overall, pretty good, although naturally the quality level varies considerably and the parables that spoke to me will not speak to others.

The stories are just too awful and didactic and trapped in a moralizing medieval milieu, centering around caricatured one-dimensional characters. However important and key to the history of literature it is, it's not worth reading for any but scholars or historians.
  *[Soldiers Live (The Chronicle of the Black Company, \#10)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=812566556&index=books "ISBN: 812566556")*                                                                                                                                                                                                 Glen Cook                                         ★★       2001   2013/06/16   A weirdly quiet and sedate ending to the entire series.<br/><br/>It's great that we have Croaker back so the series begins as it ended, but the plot is just too odd and incomplete. Everything happens too easily - I began worrying as I started the book, there were too many loose ends and nothing set up for a grand ending, and that's exactly what happened. We have the Black Company at the start overpowered as usual, as it has since Smoky started napping, with the further assistance of an even more overpowered demon; they slice through resistance with the greatest of ease, enemies like Soulcatcher or Booboo or Goblin go down trivially, and even the final defeat of Kina comes as trivial anticlimax (how the deuce did it make a lick of sense that the ancient gods couldn't destroy Kina if a little hedge wizard's spear and an exploding airplane can do the trick?!). The 'twist' ending is not shocking or compelling, and my reaction was 'oh. Well, that's nice for Croaker, I guess.' I'm sure there's all good explanations in-universe along the lines of 'the demon was helping them the entire time and eg. that's why the forvalaka dies so easily', but an explanation is just an explanation and it doesn't rescue a bad story.<br/><br/>I'm left just shaking my head, wondering what went wrong. Why did Cook go to such lengths to introduce a character as powerful and hence game-breaking as Tobo while implying a narrative of power-corrupts which never goes anywhere besides one or two instances of revenge? Why did he make the demon so cooperative? Why did he make the Howler die, in what must be the *only* instance in the entire damn series where a Taken dies and stays dead?! And so on and so forth. Reading through some interviews with Cook, I find myself wondering if he just wanted to stop the series and didn't really try hard on the ending - he certainly comes off as cynical and mercenary about writing, with little of Croaker's faith in the power of the Annals. Looking back, many of the books in *The Black Company* were weak enough that I can't really blame him for intending to stop with the first one, but now that I'm done, I'm not sure I'll bother with any future books in the universe (apparently he has one or two in the pipeline).<br/><br/>Although the title is excellent and used well.

Naturally, *Dances with Wolves* style, they'll help the hapless natives protect themselves. And we get not one but *four* of the old Taken coming back to life (Howler, Shaper, Stormbringer, and Soulcatcher) -\_-. Oh and also a 'buried evil' a la the Dominator. Yes, another one. That's what, the third now? Good grief.<br/><br/>Like the previous book, my complaint here is that the plot is simple and straightforward, parts of it are very ham-handed (eg. once I got over my disgust at yes, another Taken was back, it was pretty obvious where the crows were coming from).<br/><br/>The upside is that it's fun watching Croaker becoming the Captain and growing still more.

It's also interesting wondering what Croaker is concealing from us, what his sins are: he tells us, the readers of his Annals, that he has concealed a great deal and softened other parts.<br/><br/>The downsides are few since it's a quick read: we see entirely too much of the Company's wizards (how many times do we need to be told that Silent is silent? or that One-Eye has just one eye? or that Goblin gets the better of One-Eye?), and it doesn't do a good job putting any real doubt into our minds about whether the Lady is the least of evils in the North, since she countenances quite a bit and the rebels' sins seem like the usual sort of thing which happens in war and then the wild dogs are put down during peacetime.<br/><br/>Book 2, *Shadows Linger*, was in some respects even better than *The Black Company*. While almost all the Taken are gone and so the scope for plotting has diminished considerably, instead we get a cozy intense little drama set in Juniper, of plotting & murder & corruption with the black castle in the background rewarding & driving it all with its tempting silver as it works towards its own little doomsday (you might call it a collective action problem!). Shed's plot thread is considerably more compelling than Croaker's this time, as we watch him give in to weakness, folly, and bad luck time and again, each time helping the castle grow a little closer to completion and finally triggering an epic battle destroying the entire town and shattering the Black Company. (The focus on the locals also has the benefit of not over-exposing the Company wizards and letting us see them from an 'outsider' perspective to restore their sheen of interest.) While admittedly the black castle is more than a little contrived (the Dominator foresaw his defeat and this was the only countermeasure? the castle took 700 years to mature? he didn't foresee the Juniper death cult before entrusting his last best hope of resurrection to it?), the plot overall still works well, and the creatures of the castle start to give an impression of why allying with the Lady might be a good idea.<br/><br/>Book 3, *The White Rose*, sees it all fall apart. We're plopped on the Plain of Fear at the heart of the renewed rebellion, which is OK enough, and we start learning what happened with Bomanz to release the Lady & the Ten which is even better. But the rebellion is a tawdry little affair, and the plot unengaging. Raven's foolishness is difficult to credit. The White Rose's power is almost too powerful. Parts don't seem to hang together (how do Tracker & Toadkiller Dog arrive *with* Raven's letter if they are only released by his interference?). The final alliance is too easily accomplished. The new Taken are only names. The finale is a succession of deus ex machinas - Father Tree's offspring on top of the silver spike on top of the true effect of naming (if all it takes to destroy someone's powers is to name them, why did this never happen before, and why were we told that true names merely allowed penetrating a magician's spells and defenses?) On top of that, the finale is almost anti-climactic: they dismantle the defenses and neutralize the Dominator using the Rose, and bury him more thoroughly. Oh. Well, ok... The book isn't so much bad, as disappointing since it features none of the intricacy of the previous books, is almost oddly streamlined and 'easy', and takes some easy way outs. I had come to expect more from Cook.

Miller                                   ★★★★     2012   2013/04/25   You could see Miller's *Singularity Rising* as an attempt to swim against the book current of Ray Kurzweil and present some of the *other* visions of the Singularity: specifically, the Intelligence Explosion school (http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/schools) as exemplified by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Robin Hanson. It then mixes in a bunch of material on intelligence & genetics, so we might identify an additional subschool: that of Steve Hsu on embryo selection for increasing human intelligence.<br/><br/>Miller succeeds in giving a wide overview of quite a few topics, from Hanson's 'crack of a future dawn' em scenario ( http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html ) to the Great Filter (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Filter / http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html ) to comparative advantage as applied to AIs to the intelligence orthogonality thesis (that intelligence does not imply benevolence; http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality\_thesis) to the logic of arms race and its particularly unpleasant applicability to AI development. And then he tosses in the mentioned intelligence & genetics material, which I was a little surprised to learn from - I had read many of his citations (and actually host a few of the online copies of the papers on my personal site, gwern.net), but he still threw in some ones that were new to me.<br/><br/>On a purely factual basis, I have relatively little to fault Miller for. He makes a risible claim about 1700s French life expectancies not hitting the 50s (true only if you include infant mortality, otherwise hitting 50s was perfectly routine - even in the worst tabulations, generally if you made it to 20 on average you would reach the 50s) but he is far from the first to make that mistake; he brings up dual n-back more than once, but he avoids making too many or overreaching claims on behalf of dual n-back such as the increasingly questionable effect on intelligence (see http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ\#meta-analysis ); he seems to criticize people for not taking seriously the method of castration for life extension but doesn't mention the issues with the data and the likelihood that the method would not work post-puberty (ie. for everyone who is able to morally consent to such a procedure). Otherwise...<br/><br/>Otherwise Miller's sins are simply that the writing is merely OK and while he does a reasonable job of, as Hanson puts it in his own review of *Singularity Rising* ( http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/millers-singularity-rising.html ), "explaining common positions and intuitions behind common arguments", he barely defends them or clearly justifies them. While I and many others involved in the area dislike Ray Kurzweil's theories and arguments and books as being superficial, right for the wrong reason, overly optimistic etc, they do at least do their job of convincing people (and then hopefully they can adopt more nuanced or different views); but though I agree with a large fraction of it, it's hard to believe that anyone could read Miller's book and come out genuinely convinced of pretty much anything in it (as opposed to reactions like "that's interesting" or "maybe"). For example, he does a nice question-answer sequence against the kneejerk bad-philosophy reactions to cryonics, but one could easily bite all the bullets and simply question the incredibly sketchy case he makes (yes, it's great that wood frogs do cryonics all the time, but we're not frogs). He asks that anyone who signs up for cryonics email him about what convinced them - I immediately thought, "50% odds that no one has done so yet".<br/><br/>And aside from as comprehensive a layman discussion of the issues involved in AI economics and technological unemployment as I've ever seen, I can't really name any original contribution this book makes.<br/><br/>I can't say I'm really glad I read it, but then I can't say I really regret reading it (I got a number of IQ-related citations, a discussion of neo-Luddism, and info on the more esoteric possibilities of embryo selection). This is because I already know almost everything in the book and have read many of the citations already, so I am not the target audience; it's good if you want an overview of non-Kurzweilian Singularity ideas and you don't want to read through scores of webpages and papers, and more or less unique in conveying them all in a compact single place - so in acknowledgment of this, I bump my rating up to 4 stars (though for me it was more like 3).<br/><br/>Excerpts:<br/><br/>- intro-ch3: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/fu11KpSEyyS<br/>- ch4-5: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/QhTNetHGYiA<br/>- ch9: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/Y85Mnxab51i<br/>- ch10-12: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/XmcubNqP6Nh<br/>- ch13: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/1tB6Vt1ERMz<br/>- ch14-15: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/eRUSF1W1wUq<br/>- ch16: https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/QyLRENKEHft

The overall combination is good but nothing to write home about. The frequent appearance of autonomous vehicles is a nice touch and one too often absent from SF, near or far. Most of the technical details were good (I was not surprised to read the short author bio and learn Suarez is a practicing programmer, since the Ross character felt like an author self-insert).<br/><br/>But the decentralized conspiracy was done better in Sterling's "Maneki Neko", the creepy persuasive AI was done better in 'Friendship is Optimal', the technical detail in *Cryptonomicon*, the futuristic developments in *Otherland*, and the plutocracy/government stuff in multiple William Gibson novels (Suarez's version being more than a little bit crude - citing *Confessions of an Economic Hitman*, really?).<br/><br/>And despite the lauded technical detail, the AI presented is farcical; it's hard to see how any 'logic tree' could possibly handle all that the AI does even if Suarez throws in some failures to parse responses and writes up . (If I had an iPhone I'd probably snark about how Siri can understand the responses given by various characters fine, and hasn't taken over the world.)

Levy has information, anecdotes, quotes, and interviews which no one else does, which, like the recent Steve Jobs biography, makes his book indispensable for anyone interested in the topic regardless of the book's other merits.<br/><br/>To continue the Jobs analogy, I *think* Levy is more independent of his subject and more willing to criticize it and poke holes in their narratives - he covers the criticisms I expected, doesn't drop any particularly glaring issues, and more than once undermines their narratives with contrasting quotes & observations. In particular, Page repeatedly comes off as a narcissistic paranoid asshole, possibly due to his father's death, who cannot empathize with others or understand their points of views (a trait perhaps endemic of Googlers, to judge by the Buzz fiasco).<br/><br/>But to compensate for all the great info and explanations (more than once I thought to myself, 'ah, so *that* is what happened!'), there are downsides to the book. The principle one being:<br/><br/>Levy's writing/presentation is extremely journalistic and dumbed down. I'm not sure whether Levy simply doesn't understand programming & computers very well despite his long career covering the tech industry, or if he deliberately treats technical topics simplistically. (A description of JavaScript prefixes it with the undefined buzzword 'dynamic', although dynamic runtime typing is far from the most important aspect of JS; someone writing an early web spider is described as having a break through when they realize they can make it multithreaded, while I'm sitting back and thinking "there is no way that even in \~1995, any programmer, upon noticing that their web spider was not crawling as many URLs as he needs, would not instantly reach for multiprocessing/multithreading".) Similar simplisticness applied to the legal discussions as well (you won't come away with a real understanding of all the legal issues at play in the Google Books contretemps), and the economic ones fared much the same (I was glad Levy covered the auction innovations at Google, but couldn't he explain *why* second-price auctions are so elegant and effective?).

I enjoyed the concept and a few touches like the Thule Society, and don't regret reading it: taking blood sacrifice seriously in a "beware while fighting monsters" makes for a gradually creeping sense of doom which is fitting, and I was impressed to see the old medieval debate over the language of infants resurrected and then taken to the max, which was a real bit of esoterica. The logical conclusion, a British program into Enochian, is a nasty enough conclusion that it convinced me to keep reading the series.<br/><br/>Downsides: the repeated use of raven sections is blunt; Gretel's character is even blunter, we're told almost on sight that "she sees the future and is manipulating everyone" and this is ground in ad nauseaum, while subtlety would've worked better (maybe *1* hint at the beginning and then a revelation at the end for the inattentive reader - but we get what must be dozens instead); Nazi Germany is a total caricature; while sometimes the descriptions of places or events are excellent (like the opening), characters can be pretty wooden and I feel like Marsh is made to punch people to move the plot along (eg. to get himself fired, and then to ignore Will and not ask the sane thing like 'why would you suggest something so horrible as an abortion when you know how much losing our child hurt us?'). The alt history is a little crude and lacking in details: in contrast to *Declare* or "A Colder War", which wove in and rewrote all sorts of historical tidbits (some extremely obscure, in *Declare*), *Bitter Seeds* only does big brushstrokes - tanks going through the Ardennes, bad winter weather in Russia, a failure of a hypothetical Operation Sea Lion - and it omits all sorts of historical backgrounds that could've enriched it (Nazi occultism is a bizarre subject which is surprisingly underused by Tregillis; someone should've given him a copy of *Morning of the Magicians* or something). Hopefully he'll weave a more intricate tapestry for the Cold War books; at least, I'll be quite disappointed if James Jesus Angleton doesn't make some appearances.

I've rarely read a book where the main protagonists inspires such disgust in me - even for a picaresque, the main character Ignatius is extreme. It is as if Toole read Cleckley's *Mask of Sanity* and a psychology textbook, and said to himself, "how can I make the most offensive moronic character which mashes up the traits of both psychopaths and autists?" and then wrote a novel on it in which the protagonist's countless evil actions, glib lies, narcissism, ignorance, sloth, leeching, and other flaws finally brought down an appropriate punishment - only to rescue him at the last moment for further adventures.<br/><br/>In particular, I'm not bothered that Ignatius pretends to be a medievalist Catholic. I'm bothered that as far as I can tell, Toole seems to genuinely try to present Ignatius as educated and learned and with a worldview (and reading the reviews here, it seems that most people do indeed take this for granted). The problem is, Toole fails. Utterly. In the entire book, Ignatius's learning is displayed solely as repeated surface allusions to Boethius and Hroswitha, and a few other dropped names, and never anything of substance. Someone who read Wikipedia on Boethius and Hroswitha would know more than Ignatius does, and is probably literate enough to spot Ignatius (and by extension, Toole's) failures, like writing 'gyro' where they were trying to make an allusion to Yeats's 'gyre' (way to mess up an allusion to only one of the most famous poems ever!).<br/><br/>So, with the complete failure of Igantius to offer any sort of Catholicly-grounded interesting critique or reflection on society (as a good picaresque is *supposed to*!), we're left with the evocation of New Orleans (seems good enough, although I don't know enough about New Orleans to really judge), the humorous value of each set piece (overall, low. Jeeves this is not.), and the final convergence of plot threads at the bar (a decent enough denouement but still leaves the first 150 pages a drag).<br/><br/>Is that enough to make it a masterpiece? I should think not. Indeed, *A Confederacy of Dunces* overall stands in stark contrast to Gene Wolfe or R.A. Lafferty's better novels.

Even when you think it's done on Mt Ararat (and Powers has in a final flourish explained Philby dying shortly before the Berlin Wall), the plot isn't entirely over and there are multiple more deceptions and operations to go. And to top it all off, Powers takes an afterword to "shown their work" and reveal how "freaker than fiction" in TvTropese, but it's hard to blame him for not being really pleased with some of the genuine incidents he works in.

My opinion was modified only somewhat by reading Isaacson's *Steve Jobs*: Jobs could be munificent and non-penny-pinching - for anything to do with *himself*.

To go through it roughly in order:<br/><br/>1) the first few chapters are a serviceable philosophy of science primer. We get discussion of how the Scientific Revolution was a break, we get some Popper and falsificationism, and as a very important correction, some Duhem-Quine; we get some cultural and vocation material, and discussion of the value of prediction even in non-experimental sciences. Chapter 6 is a bit of a waste as Manzi makes the standard criticism of frequentism that the basic ideal - probability as the limit of some particular set of events - is extremely imprecise since it gives absolutely no guide as to *which* set of events, since you can choose arbitrarily complicated events, but he does so on his own terms and without any reference to competing paradigms such as Bayesianism.<br/>2) then we get into genuinely important material on the development of RCTs (he uses RFT, which I find silly). Personally, I could wish for a whole book on the gradual development and refinement, and many more examples of the superiority of RCTs to other approaches; his summaries of things like the US social program experiments is short and in many ways inferior to, say, Rossi's "metallic laws" ( http://www.gwern.net/docs/1987-rossi ). ch9's example analyses read like columns folded into the chapter, but I still enjoyed them as fun examples of critical thinking and how analyses can reach any goal.<br/>3) with ch10 we finally get into Manzi's own career. This section is... weirdly lacking in many examples, even though it's the section where you would expect Manzi to just lay the smack down with countless scores of anecdotes and stories and statistics about how experimentation is the *ne plus ultra* of epistemology and exactly how much money it made all these corporations. There's a few, like Capital One and some Internet companies, but it is not very thematically separate from 2).<br/>4) he issues some policy recommendations. Hard to argue with some of them: why not let in some immigrants as part of randomized experiments? It can hardly be worse than the current system. Fairly anodyne.<br/><br/>So overall good, and maybe great for people who aren't familiar with the topics. But I think in general if I wanted a layman to appreciate statistics and its pitfalls and experiments, I might actually be better off giving them Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* (although they're not totally comparable, of course).<br/><br/>People seem impressed by his Hayekian libertarian arguments using genetic algorithms as arguments. I don't think they're as well supported as they may seem. Just to name the obvious, society has changed massively over short time-spans, and corporate mortality is astonishingly high; evolution, as it happens, can only filter out so many mutations per generation so past a certain point, a genome just decays...

Nevertheless, NGE fans will still find many revelations here, like the origin of NGE production in the failure of the *Aoki Uru* film project.<br/><br/>In general, Takeda is not interested in a 'tell-all'; perhaps it's due to fear, perhaps too many people involved are still alive and kicking, but he only covers the embarrassing things which are too well-known to omit, like the aforementioned tax raid or Okada's ouster from Gainax.<br/><br/>I read it several times, and wound up transcribing my copy into a webpage which I could annotate with cross-references and interviews with other figures like Okada or Anno. It's been a valuable resource ever since.

And are we to be moved by this? The labyrinth is constantly described and discussed in it, but one thing that goes unnoticed is that with the exception of Daedalus's labyrinth, at the enter of almost all labyrinths is nothing at all, and when one reaches it, the only thing to is shrug and head back out.

It has come to this. WoT finally ended.<br/><br/>I remember how the wheel of dharma began to turn for me: my mother ran a Girl Scouts troop while I was in middle school, and sometimes they met at a local town rec center. Rather than try to participate, I would sometimes kill time in the lounge reading their old donated paperbacks. One of them was remarkably thick, but the cover looked interesting, and I was hooked by the opening passages: a Tolkien-esque chapter about a young lad heading back to the Shire and haunted by a Ring-wraith. I'd read Tolkien by this point, of course, and wondered if it'd be an awful shameful ripoff like *Sword of Shannara*, but I kept reading and it unfolded into a lovely adventure with new items, powers, and concepts jampacked and culminating in the Green Man at the Eye of the World. I was impressed as I read it over the weeks, meeting by meeting, and soon checked out the other 6 or so. This was a long time ago. A very long time ago.<br/><br/>One of the lessons I learned from WoT was learning the hard way why one should avoid in-progress series: the mental suffering and time expended is radically out of proportion to the pleasure. (I am handily applying this lesson now to that *other* endless vast fantasy epic, GRRM. Given my pre-2007 comments that it was entirely possible that Jordan would die before finishing, I wonder how that one will turn out.) Another lesson is that length and a big cast of characters should not be taken as a goal in its own right because you descend into repetition and cliche.<br/><br/>In some sense, Sanderson's AMoL for me succeeds just by existing and giving me closure. I would be happy if it is not as enraging as King's ending to *The Dark Tower*, or as unremittingly awful and a disgrace to all parties involved as Brian Herbert & KJA's work in the Dune universe. Perhaps all the people on Goodreads who are leaving laudatory 5 star reviews without even reading the book and apparently are ignorant of what a "review" is feel the same way - that as long as it's not awful, it deserves 5 stars for giving them closure.<br/><br/>And it's neither enraging nor terribly awful, so I am satisfied.<br/><br/>I share a lot of the complaints I've seen in other reviews. Some characters like Moiraine do nothing interesting; others have compressed endings like Luc/Isam and Padan Fain. Bela dies despite an expectation that she would continue her improbable luck. The body-swapping is unprecedented and confusing, since it apparently is not due to Rand indulging in cosmic powers but a mysterious gray-haired woman who I could not understand after two reads and googling a bit. The resolution of confrontation with the Dark One was clever as far as it went, but it relied on a feature of Callandor I am pretty sure was not mentioned before and I feel a bit deus ex machinad, although I'm relieved that the general interpretation of Herid Fel's basic point that because of the Wheel, you have to restore the prison to how it was *before* the Bore (rather than patch it again, kill the Dark One, etc) was correct.<br/><br/>There were many great bits. Rand and Matt bragging in one of their last meetings. Lan taking down Damodred (although didn't we see the suicidal maneuver in a previous book...). Min vs spies. Demandred and Graendal make the Forsaken look less incompetent than usual. Thom casually knifing women while composing a poem.<br/><br/>Many bad parts.<br/><br/>The endless grinding battle - by the time I finished the book, I felt as exhausted as if I'd been pushing pikes with Trollocs myself. The worst part was, despite the endless pages of battle, the battles still didn't feel epic or hardfought; they lacked any urgency or real drama. Perhaps WoT just massively over-indulged in battles before, or perhaps the battles were just disconnected - it's a bad thing when you have characters lampshading the triviality of what they're doing and asking 'so why does this matter when the only battle that matters is Rand vs DO?' The battles are weirdly parochial and limited to a few locations. 4 battlefronts is impressive? For the Last Battle, a worldwide struggle against the Shadow? We didn't get so much as one point of view in, I dunno, Seanchan which was supposed to have waged its own epic struggle against Shadowspawn during the original colonization! We don't get Waygates popping open in hundreds of locations, the entire Randland convulsed in thousands of battles... Basically, we didn't see a world at war. We bounced between 4 locations again and again and again until it was an incredible chore to read another page. Last minute rescues are a storytelling device that work only a few times. In a chapter. Before they lose any impact.<br/><br/>Some of the writing seems stiff and clumsy, and I liked Matt less than in the previous book so I suppose that was just an anomaly.<br/><br/>The 'philosophy' bits of the Rand vs DO encounter were seriously juvenile; so Rand overcomes the DO with the Power of Love but then he realizes that to destroy the DO, he would take away Free Will! And just as any idiot could have predicted, he has to leave the DO alone and repair the prison good as new. And of course the DO whines at him and Rand has to lecture him self-righteously... Give me a break. I'm sure that this must have been Jordon's notes, because I remember Sanderson doing better in *Mistborn*.<br/><br/>I suspect people will be identifying loose ends and missed prophecies or Min-visions for years to come. At least we did sorta find out who killed Asmodean.<br/><br/>So now that it is finished, what should I think of WoT? Would I recommend it to a younger version of me? I think I would. In bulk, WoT's flaws are reduced. The repetition fades away like the Homeric epithets filling out lines, and the multi-million word count becomes less intimidating. The awful middle-late books, like possibly the series nadir *Winter's Heart*, lose their severe aggravation when you have all the books in a pile waiting to be read instead of an unknown multi-year wait upon an author who may (and did) die on you. Without years between reads, the plots and characters will be easier to track, and even if one fails to pick up on clues or asides, the resolution will be delivered soon and one can go 'ah!' as one newly appreciates a new thread of the pattern.<br/><br/>But I would accompany it with this caution: <br/><br/>"WoT, in small chunks, is not good. The characters and writing is repetitious, the descriptions pedestrian; few passages will move you with the beauty of strangeness or exoticism that marks the best fantasy. What WoT does is take the 'quantity vs quality' tradeoff, and jam it all the way to 'quantity', to see what happens, and does so more extremely than any other fantasy series I know of. If you want to see 'epic fantasy', with a cast of who knows how many thousands, spread over more countries than you can keep straight, and watch this tapestry evolve over years and millions of words, then you must read WoT. If you want to maximize your enjoyment per word, if you want the heights of what the fantasy genre can deliver in terms of quality, then put away WoT for another day and instead do something like read through chronologically the winners of the Locus & World Fantasy Awards."<br/><br/>There have been worse obituaries for pieces of your childhood.

He cites Tocqueville approvingly on the lack of coherence of the narrative of the French Revolution with the observed facts that the French had never had it better than before the Revolution - but how can I then have any confidence in any of *his* narratives?

Cleckley                                ★★★★     2003   2012/12/21   Cleckley scatters through this book constant fascinating anecdotes and remarks, some so outrageous or remarkable that one would assume he made them up if he were writing on some other topic.<br/><br/>Cleckley's moralizing and occasional very old-fashioned comments are occasionally as interesting, and reading him in 2012, one feels very strongly just how distant (in a social mores sense) we are from him in the 1940s and earlier - when he writes of 'miscegenation' (I wonder how many teenagers now could tell you what 'sexual miscegenation' is), when he defends homosexuals as possibly not insane but sometimes even decent people, or when he speaks in horror of female psychopaths not guarding their virginity, or in a half-page fulminating against the hippies, or when he speculates that a healthy male adult might - after several years stranded on a desert island - enjoy masturbation (no, really?).<br/><br/>Sadly, Cleckley is not nearly as dated as one would hope after reading something like 200 pages detailing the endless wake of destruction, fraud, violence, deception, manipulation, and criminality: his basic conclusion that there are no effective treatments for psychopathy, and all previous attempts have been expensive failures, seems to remain true. Indeed, some attempts at treatment have backfired and resulted in even more crime being committed by subjects. (Background: http://lesswrong.com/lw/fzy/notes\_on\_psychopathy/ )

In general, the 'pacing' is quite odd: reams of material on South America, some pages on the Galapagos, a dash to New Zealand & Australia, a long section on islands and 'cacao-nuts' (coconuts), a mini-monograph on coral atolls, and the book abruptly ends.<br/><br/>Which is not to say he doesn't occasionally drop in interesting or acute observations, for he does. (The shepherd-dog of South America quite took my fancy, for example.) They are just rare welcome morsels in the general desert of this door-stopper. If I had to recommend it to my past self, I would tell him to skip the bulk but to read the Tierra del Fuego sections where the events are both interesting and evocative of the long uncivilized past of man (and perhaps his future), the Galapagos section for its substantial historical interest, and maybe the brief conclusion.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>My National Geographic anniversary edition is substantially lacking in additional material; there is surprisingly little about its reception, what contributions it made, where it was prescient and where it was wrong (disturbing, since one doesn't know what mistakes, misimpressions, outdated information, plausible yet wrong speculation, etc. one might be absorbing over the 400+ pages). As well, Darwin's original illustrations would benefit mightily from additional material like color photographs and maps.

He is the closest thing to a modern Jorge Luis Borges in melding high concepts with literature to create something better than either; in some respects, I'd rank his best short stories as better than Gene Wolfe's. His writing is deceptively excellent: I would call him a writer's writer, because the flat evenness of his prose may strike a reader as boring unless they have tried to write as clearly themselves and failed abysmally, at which point they begin to appreciate the infallible choice of words and clear prose which sinks into the mind without friction.<br/><br/>*Stories of Your Life and Others* is much superior to *Life Cycle of Software Objects*, and contains pretty much all of his greatest short stories which I have read, except for "Exhalation". I read most of them online, so when I had the chance to read a hardcopy of the full collection, I seized it.<br/><br/>1. "The Tower of Babylon"; amusing, and in describing the lives of the people living on the tower, moving in some respects. The final ending feels like an appropriate conclusion. If one had to criticize it, it would be that the Tower itself is completely unrealistic even in the Biblical cosmology of the story: as I said, the best Chiang stories unite literature and good ideas.<br/>2. "Division by Zero"; not terribly impressive - over-wrought, and I feel I have read this story before and better.<br/>3. "Understand"; a classic in the niche genre of superintelligence, and IMO at least as good as 'Flowers for Algernon'. Chiang, like every other author, confronts the limits of his writing ability in trying to write convincingly of a superintelligence who is by definition vastly smarter than he is (the same challenge laid down by Campbell to Vinge: 'you can't write this story, and neither can anyone else'), and so the start of the story is much stronger than the later passages. But the whole is still memorable.<br/>4. "Story of Your Life"; I had actually read this one before, and dismissed it as sentimental tripe with some weak physics or linguistic layering that I didn't really understand. Fortunately, just a few weeks ago I happened to read some material on the Lagrangian interpretations of physics and combined with knowing in advance the ending, I was able to appreciate the story much better this time. I would rank this \#3 of the 8 stories.<br/>5. "The Evolution of Human Science"; short, dubious. Not Chiang's best work, on either dimension.<br/>6. "Seventy-Two Letters"; simply fantastic. The setting is wonderful, the problem great, the ideas even better, and the solution & meaning better still. \#2.<br/>7. "Hell Is the Absence of God"; as an atheist who keeps coming back to the Book of Job, this story came as a gut punch. The writing is Chiang at his most Chiangy, the world interesting and provocative, and the ending simply unspeakable. But don't take my word for it, 'decide for yourself', as the fallen angels say. \#1.<br/>8. "Liking What You See: A Documentary"; interesting ideas, but something about the dialogues and characters seem off. It just jars me.

(One exception is the discussion of APRs and how the loans actually are done which renders them far less usurious.) Ironically, the appendices were more interesting than many of the narratives in the later chapters.

Banks is a great author, so of course there are plenty of rewarding nuggets scattered through out (the haunted ex-Culture man, the deceptive artifact, the general convincingness of 'the stage is small but the audience great' theme etc.), but much less than expected from a groaning tome's worth of Banks. The shell world concept is not developed or employed well (you could replace all of the maneuverings with 2D equivalents if you wished), and the rest of the background and concepts seem pretty stock Culture.<br/><br/>\* eg. I was expecting the betrayal to be linked to alien machinations, but no, it turns out to be exactly as simplistic as it seems, the ex-SC guy's good argument to the contrary, and a complete red herring as he dies with everyone else, the complexity of his character never ascending beyond cackling evil.

Similar to Tad William's *Otherland* (the fantastic first book *City of Golden Shadow*, not the horrible sequels), Dos Passos's *USA*, or particularly Brunner's *Stand On Zanzibar* (to which Brin alludes, actually, in having a alien say "what an imagination I've got.")<br/><br/>The overriding theme is, of course, the Great Silence. Brin's solution, characteristically for a guy who wants to be the ultimate moderate and more moderate than thou, is to take up every solution: the Great Silence is due to more efficient physical transportation *and* memetic viruses *and* Berserkers *and* Lurkers *and* panspermia *and* ecological collapse *and* nuclear war *and*... This is a little impressive to behold, and overall, I did enjoy reading the book. Brin has had a few new ideas since *Earth* like the smart-mob.<br/><br/>But for the bad:<br/><br/>This jumping makes the book something like a huge primer on the Great Silence/Fermi's Question, yes, but *also* for something of a mess of a book. The book is huge, but a good deal of the bulk is fat and self-indulgent:<br/><br/>1. the dolphin sub-plot is rehashed Uplift material, which only very charitably has any relevance to anything else in the book (I thought that we would at least see them towards the end on spaceships as a token nod toward justifying the time spent on them, but no!)<br/>2. More germane subplots feel incomplete; the autistic kids, "cobblies" and the "Basque Chimera" form one such oddly underjustified subplot - is this a thing, now, lauding crippled autistic kids as secret savant heroes? I don't know which narrative is more denigrating of the human suffering involved, the standard one or this one. (Austism spectrum may be useful in some areas, but only a *little* is necessary and even the high-functioning often fail: I read in the *New York Times* the other day that that famous tech firm which uses autistic workers has a 5/6 rejection rate of applicants just from the start. One must sift a lot of sand.)<br/>3. much material is borrowed from his previous nonfiction or fiction; allusions to *The Postman* are well and good, but when I could predict the resolution of the Senator Strong mystery from the instant we were told it was an addiction... This also means that I can track how many authorial mouthpieces there are in the novel, and it's pretty much all of them. Even people you think are wrong like Hamish are just acting as conduits for Brin's own beliefs. This leads to the severe problem, in a repeated first contact novel, that none of the aliens were remotely alien, and the humans all seemed pretty similar to each other too. It made me wish for Stanislaw Lem, or at least Watts's *Blindsight*.<br/><br/>Brin also has a very weird attitude towards what he calls extropianism but most people these days just call transhumanism. For example, the bogus anti-caloric restriction argument Hamish gives; it is bogus because (a) none of those monks or monasteries are following nutritionally balanced diets, indeed, usually for religious reasons they're following highly unbalanced diets if they're not like the Taoists possibly actively poisoning themselves with mercury, and (b) the records do claim countless instances of extreme longevity, which of course we don't believe because record-keeping was terrible - which means the evidence is so worthless and biased and corrupt that we can't use it to claim the opposite either! I've told Brin this like twice before, not that he cared. But by the time the story is set, the caloric restriction question will be settled: the primate studies will be finished, the human CRers will be dead, and the underlying biochemistry (or lack thereof) will have been elucidated. Suppose he's wrong? He probably doesn't care, he's dead-set against it anyway! I was a little awe-struck when he has his mouthpiece badmouth cryonics, *after saying it worked and there had been revivals*? WTF?<br/><br/>WTF indeed. This attitude could be called schizophrenic. Throughout the novel, Brin seems to struggle with the fundamental problem posed by Vinge: how does he keep the story human given his belief in progress and his basic acceptance of the Strong AI thesis? He never comes up with a good answers, but blatantly hand-waves them away: an emulated rat brain goes critical and escapes into the Internet? Well, uh - nothing happens because I say so (wow, ain't it strange)! There are even more AIs pervading the world, controlling countless key functions? Well, uh - nothing happens because I insinuate something about parents and children and them being grateful! (wow, ain't it strange - ever see a grateful river, spider, tow-truck, computer...? Humans can barely be grateful, ever.) Humanity is a few decades away from a general nanofactory assembler in his story and thousands of crystal probes come to visit? Well, uh - the crystal probes are completely inactive and don't carry nanofactories or *anything* despite it being a mindbogglingly great & evolutionarily fit idea and perfectly doable for them, because I say so and it lets me write adventure arcs with primates fighting over & chucking around glowing rocks! (wow, ain't it strange) He'll mock the extropians in the first part for believing in cryonics or uploads or AIs even though the most-criticized belief, cryonics, has been vindicated 100% in his story even beyond their hopes, their expectations of uploads are equally justified by events towards the end - non-destructive uploading, even! we'd settle for destructive uploads at this point... and so on and so forth. Well, uh - they're right but they're wrong, don't you see! (wow, ain't it strange)

Kube-McDowell                          ★★★      1996                As a kid collecting EU novels and stories, I was always puzzled by *The Black Fleet Crisis* trilogy. It was wildly different in tone and subject matter from most of the EU, I didn't know whether I hated it or loved it, and it seemed to have been largely ignored by the rest of the EU (ever see the Yevetha or Black Sword Command or the White Current mentioned elsewhere?). This ignoring has happened for a number of other books like the *Dark Empire* comics or *Crystal Star*, but usually for good reasons: *Dark Empire* was so over-the-top and gothic that to take it seriously would undermine many other stories and so it's usually name-checked briefly, if that, and ignored, while *Crystal Star* was just so terrible it can be ignored. Neither of these seem especially applicable, though, so I didn't know what to think.<br/><br/>Having reread the trilogy now, I think I understand it better. It's essentially a Weber/Drake/Clancy-style military or mil-sf novel, which happens to be set in the EU and feature 2 distracting large subplots. From the great opening Fifth Fleet exercise to the equally great small subplot of discovering the Black Sword records (I'm nerdy enough to really like that, and also the various library/research issues in the Lando subplot) to the excellent finish, that's what it really is.<br/><br/>The problem is in large part the non-Yevethan subplots:<br/><br/>1. there's a reasonably interesting first-contact story using Lando which keeps distracting from the real story and which has absolutely no relevance to the other 2 subplots and is completely unnecessary. (Another reviewer comments that it would fit nicely as a stand-alone story like the pulpy *Han Solo Adventures*; I agree, and actually there were multiple *Lando Calrissian Adventures*, so even more reason...)<br/>2. The subplot for Luke has more justification than Lando, but is still problematic for how sheerly boring and pointless it is. The ultimate justification seems to be the White Current assistance in the final battle and revelation of how they had been working against the Yevetha all along, but this is not much of a justification. It's probably just as well, since any real info about Luke's mother would have been rendered moot by the prequels (and I wonder if that's why the ending *had* to be so disappointing?). The positive side is that in some respects, this subplot seems to anticipate how a lot of later writers would handle Luke - so perhaps we should not criticize Luke's hermetical ways and musings. (Some of the resemblances to the Yuuzhan Vong/New Jedi Order story-arcs are striking, although I hated them enough that I stopped reading the EU after they started coming out.) Certainly he serves as a vehicle for some interesting bits like reflecting on the death toll of the first Death Star (although the Imperial Museum in *Wedge's Gamble* is still a far better scene).<br/><br/>(One missed opportunity is Drayson; since Drayson is a key player in the major arc, and a key player in the start and end of Lando's arc, the trilogy missed a chance to make an interesting and subtle move: have Drayson be the topic of the trilogy! It would examine his methods, choices, and beliefs as contrasted against those he manipulates and serves. Most people would not appreciate this subtlety, but that only makes it mirror the life of its subject all the more. But he plays no role in Luke's subplot, so the interpretation fails. Too bad. The spy novel aspects were a major reason why Zahn's trilogy was, and probably still remains, the greatest EU series.)<br/><br/>The criticism of Leia in the trilogy is, I think, off-base. A good character is not a omni-perfect automaton who never makes mistakes; Leia needs to make mistakes, and this depicts one of them. Calling that 'bad characterization' is just fanboyism. I am reminded of a foreword to one of the character encyclopedias which enthused, "Check it out, Leia never misses [in *A New Hope*]". I did. She does, several times.

That's... not a good way to either demonstrate Bayes is good in history nor to convince people of his overarching claims like 'all correct historical inference is Bayesian inference'.<br/><br/>The way to introduce a new paradigm is to start with its successes, where Bayesian methods led to a correct prediction or retrodiction of an issue where decisive evidence surfaced while before the issue was settled, conventional methods were confused, wrong, or underconfident; and *then* argue that its practical success combined with your philosophical arguments about Bayesian reasoning being the only correct reasoning is a convincing synthesis, maybe then work out verdicts/predictions/retrodictions on a non-controversial area so the experts can see how they like the conclusions, and only *then* extend it to highly controversial and difficult (scarce or low-quality evidence) material.<br/><br/>I understand how he would come to write it that way since that's what he was paid to do and Biblical material has become his specialty but I can still regret that the outcome wasn't as good as it could've been.

He is good enough to make a number of specific predictions... pretty much all of which are wrong.<br/><br/>For example, he predicts that post-WWII that the military would expand massively and form a real faction as opposed to a little 'puddle' (right) and that officers would enter the governing elites and change the composition of the ruling classes (wrong; Eisenhower was elected president, but there is no visible change in composition - few presidents or candidates have benefitted from service, and contenders like Colin Powell or Wesley Clark have either not run or sunk like a stone. Congress remains a province of lawyers, and no one gets wealthy in the military until they take the revolving door), and further that his loosely defined Bonapartism is inevitable although I do not recognize Clinton, Bush, or Obama as being very Bonapart-like figures.<br/><br/>On pg259-260, he presents a doozy of'scientific statements about social matters':<br/><br/>\> ...Thus we now may know, with considerably probability, that: if the state absorbs under centralized control all major social forces, then political liberty will disappear; if, after this war, Europe is again divided into a considerable number of independent sovereign states, then a new war will begin in Europe within a comparatively short time; if the present plan of military strategy (i.e., submarine attrition warfare, and "island-hopping") continues unchanged in the East, then Japan will not be definitely crushed for many, many years, and perhaps never; if the present Administration plans to remain in office after 1944, then it will have to curtail political liberty further; and so on.<br/><br/>These statements were published in 1943, well after such events as the Battle of Midway (June 1942).<br/>About the best I can say is that charitably, the counterfactual precondition for one may not have been true (if we assume 'Administration' refers to FDR, and not his Vice President, Trumann, who succeeded FDR on his premature death and then was re-elected with no visible brownshirts stuffing pollboxes). The rest are simply embarrassing. The science of politics must indeed have been young... (Or perhaps there's some other common thread to the political criticism that opens and closes the book.)

Sowell is not that great a prose stylist and has a gift for putting things in ways that irritate the hell out of me even when I already agree with him.<br/><br/>More importantly, the promise of the flaps and introduction is *not* borne out as far as I read. It was not an investigation, either psychological or historical or economic, of intellectuals or recent intellectual history. It was simply a partisan rant bringing up all the old arguments and citations we've seen a million times before; I give him points for thorough - dare I say, intellectual - sourcing, which is more than one can say about eg. Michael Moore or Ann Coulter's books (he wrote, damning with faint praise).<br/><br/>There are arguments in it which I find hard to believe would pass Sowell's own muster if they were dressed up in liberal guise.<br/><br/>For example, on pg27 I was shocked to see - in the middle of his haranguing liberals for insufficient attention to economics - him *seriously* argue that oil company executive salaries are irrelevant because they add only a dime to the cost of gasoline gallons! Wow! Imagine Sowell's reaction to the following argument: "regulation XYZ is not worth debating about because, after all, when implemented it will add no more than a dime to the cost of gas" - can there be any doubt that he would rip this argument to little eeny-weeny shreds for failing to 'think on the margin' and realize that an extra dime will make or break many economic decisions and ramify throughout the economy? How was it possible for him to write such a transparently partisan thing? Because it was a good bash at his enemies.<br/><br/>('Politics is the mind-killer', as we say on LessWrong.)<br/><br/>Or another example from pg21; having finished reciting the Hayekian argument that no one can generalize over the entire economy or populace and central planning is impossible, he then goes on (???) to discuss how Cicero told his friend all English slaves were completely worthless and how Teddy Roosevelt hated all Indians and rather than criticizing their opinions as a perfect example of the intellectual's arrogance in generalizing from tiny tiny samples (both Cicero and Teddy were intellectuals par excellance), he *defends* their bigotry, arguing that critics are themselves being arrogant! What is this I don't even -<br/><br/>It came as no surprise on pg28 to see a caricature of economic libertarianism and zero mentions of standing disproofs of the simplistic models like Coase's point about large firms being economic absurdities and central planning in a different disguise, since I wasn't expecting very much any more.<br/><br/>By pg30, I abandoned my sporadic note-taking and began playing a little game: write down every time a thinker or politician who could be described as conservative or libertarian is criticized or given as an example of the evils of intellectualism.<br/>Naturally, I didn't expect to see Hayek come up for hobnobbing with dictatorships (any more than people discussing Mother Theresa usually bring up her more questionable funding sources), but still - an entire book ought to provide at least 1 or 2 examples.<br/><br/>In the 70s or 80s, I thought I might *finally* have something to add to my list: Naziism and Italian fascism. Surely those would get criticized, as they notoriously aimed to remake their entire societies, with disastrous results? But no! I learned, to my surprise, apparently fascism and Naziism are socialist liberal parties and they are just more liberal examples of intellectual arrogance!<br/><br/>Apparently no one on the right end of the political spectrum has ever proposed or implemented any bad idea, ever. Even if I granted the fairness and accuracy of all his descriptions of left-wingers, his conclusions or synthesis would be completely worthless as it omits half the political spectrum! It would be like doing a study of cancer patients and throwing out every patient who was a Democrat - what could you possibly hope to learn at the en, after you did that?<br/><br/>The Naziism-is-socialism finally broke me. Writing a bad review is not so worthwhile as to be worth going through this. The book was nothing but capsule hitjobs of everyone Sowell disliked at any point, and gave no indication that it would be anything but that for the entire rest of the book.<br/><br/>Life is too short to read Sowell, and I had Charles Murray's *Coming Apart: The State of White America* to read, which I've been looking forward to reading for a long time.

Throughout were revelations to me - just how ruinous WWI was, how reparations kept echoing and damaging Germany, how exactly the hyperinflation started (it was only partly the Versailles payments but more the social programs?), how America aggravated the issue (the Coolidge quote and the American tourists certainly never appeared in my history textbooks...), how late the stock bubble was and the details of the endless succession of crises that rocked Europe. It's also interesting to understand why Keynes had such a grip on economics until recently: he predicted repeatedly what would happen, and it's hard not to sympathize a great deal with him.<br/><br/>As far as criticism goes, I can agree with some of the other reviewers: Ahamed sometimes goes overboard with the narration, and skimps on the details one might want. He provides no convenient graphical network of how factors affect each other in a gold economy, so one is left constantly being surprised by connections, and the rare graph is not very helpful - for example, he provides a time graph of the big economies' rises and falls in growths, and remarks that their recoveries in the Great Depression... and nowhere on the graph marks for each country the year in which they left gold! Well, that graph wasn't very informative or helpful - Tufte would not be pleased.<br/><br/>Applying it to modern times is a little harder, although the ironies are many (particularly the Germans being hardasses on debt now, when they seemed to understand not all debts could be paid after WWI... -\_-). One thing that struck me was how the nationalist demonstrations & protests in Germany reminded me of what I hear in *China* these days - which has a somewhat similar per capita GDP as those nations and is in a similar period of industrial growth, and indeed, is the young turk of Germany to the old tired island-nation England of Japan, with South Korea as a nervous smaller neighbor (France?). And China is quite aggressive lately. Before WWI, it was rightly pointed out that such a war between such networked nations as France/Germany/England would lead to ruin; and right now, one could point out a similar thing with China/SK/Japan/USA. But nevertheless, before WWI, they thought they could have a short victorious war against an encircling enemy; does China think it can have a short victorious war against their encircling enemy, the USA-coordinate nations? I don't think it does, but I do think people underestimate the risk of war in East Asia. (Of course it could never happen; just like WWI could never happen.)

A third of the way through, I was ready for 2 stars, and reading only because I remembered the preview as being pretty good; it was reading like the worst parts of Doctorow crossed with cutting-floor scraps from Stross's *Accelerando* (general advice: if you haven't read *Accelerando* yet, I strongly strongly recommend it over *Rapture of the Nerds*).<br/><br/>After suffering through the crap of the first half, I *finally* get to the real story (recommendation: C-f to "It's the Singularity!" if you want to save yourself the grief). This is pretty fun and decent, although the judge scenario is far from new.

It feels inhuman, mechanical, and all the more so when you know that these sort of policies *were* how the Qin crushed all their opposition - including those states espousing the other Hundred Schools of Thought like Mohism & Confucianism - and that the 20th century affords further examples of how these policies proved themselves in practice (unlike the former Schools).<br/><br/>It's no wonder that there are so many negative reviews on the other copies here at Goodreads: you might as well ask your normal liberal Western to drink rat poison as read *The Book of Lord Shang* & try to fairly evaluate it. Even if they've read their share of Chinese classics & philosophy, they wouldn't *want* to understand it, just like modern readers don't *want* to understand the Unabomber's philosophy.<br/><br/>(The version I read was from http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/duyvendak\_jjl/B25\_book\_of\_lord\_shang/duyvlord.rtf )

Dyson                                   ★★★★     2012   2012/09/06   Mixed feelings. On the one hand, Dyson digs up all sorts of quotable lines and anecdotes and biographical details, many genuinely new to me. I enjoyed those greatly. For these I give it 4 stars. On the other hand...<br/><br/>He is obsessed with Von Neumann's IAS/MANIAC, to the detriment of the rest of the book. The pre-WWII history is OK but signally fails to explain things like the Hilbert program, Goedel or Turing's actual halting theorem. Someone who read this expecting to understand 'Turing's cathedral' would be vastly better served reading a book like Hofstadter's *Goedel, Escher, Bach* (as old as it is). Instead, countless pages are taken up with detailed technical information that is simultaneously in depth and also poorly explained. I repeatedly got the feeling that Dyson is indulging in that common temptation, allocating material based on how much effort it took to find, not what would inform the reader - he went through a lot of work documenting MANIAC and the rest of us must enjoy (suffer) the fruits of it. I felt that if I didn't already know a great deal of this material, I would be completely lost inside the book; I wonder how much other people could get out of it.<br/><br/>The repeated analogies to search engines and modern computing come off very poorly (search engines are analogue? Oookkaayyy....); much could have been said about how modern chip architectures and cloud computing designs are not very Von Neumannian now, so here again I wonder if it's a forced attempt to show contemporary relevance or perhaps just influence from his Google visit.<br/><br/>Other parts make one question how much Dyson understands: he links Goedelian/Turing incompleteness to computer viruses and concludes with grand '90s-esque visions (pace Kevin Kelly's old *Out of Control* book) of viruses spreading out through the Internet and beating on the walls of clean computers - but viruses aren't really a problem these days, nothing like they used to be, and the situation seems apt to only improve! Like spam, the solutions are not perfect and require a great deal of manpower & cleverness, but they are working and currently seem likely to steadily improve; this wouldn't be a surprise to him if he had really appreciated that Goedelian/Turing-incompleteness implies that there *are* large decidable subsets of programs and we can build our systems out of those. (Every programmer who uses a language with a decent type system is doing something a naive understanding of incompleteness says is impossible: he's executing nontrivial predicates over his program.)<br/><br/>For those reasons and others, this will never get 5 stars from me, and if there were a 3.5 stars, I'd go with that.

It has some fantastic moments & writing (eg. Chigurh's first coin toss), but wrapped in a plot which feels simplistic, cheap, linear, and video game-like; I thought at one moment that it was no surprise that it made what was apparently a great movie, since it read like a screenplay version of the real novel. Harold Bloom mentioned that the apocalypticism was a flaw, and here I would agree: it's a flaw I've also seen surface in Gene Wolfe, and which tarnishes the stories or novels which take up a crude - dare I say, conservative? - sort of jeremiad against these fallen latter days.

Scott Bakker                                   ★★       2007                A major disappointment; the epic grinds to a baffled conclusion which undermines the interest of the previous two novels. Having wondered for two enormous books what Kelhus's father has been up to, we discover that it is... not much, because he screwed up; having wondered for two enormous books why the Cishaurim attacked the Scarlet Spires, setting in motion a substantial amount of the plot, we learn why and it is beyond stupid (so the Cishaurim on discovering a skin-spy immediately assume it was from the Scarlet Spires, do not negotiate or warn or investigate in any way, and immediately laugh a decapitation strike? If this were TvTropes, it'd be an entry on the Idiot Ball page. One almost wishes Bakker had Moenghus take responsibility, because at least then it would make *some* sense.) The conquests become lackluster after book 2.<br/><br/>The only redeeming aspect is that Paul becoming Padishah Emperor sets us up for *Dune Messiah* - sorry, I mean Kelhus becoming Aspect-Emperor sets us up for *The Judging Eye*, which has more intrinsic interest.

I see complaints online that 'Streets' is an unfair caricature and reveals Harrison's stock atheism, but it's hard to lay out the world, story, maintain a decent style, and also be subtle or fair in just a few pages), but that's a price I'm willing to pay. Also on the downside for a modern reader, Harrison shared the common SF preoccupation with the 'population bomb' and coming Peak Oil/great dieback; neither of which seem to have happened, thankfully, but they still irritate one to read just a little bit.<br/><br/>Hence, I couldn't give this a 4 or a 5, but I don't regret reading it since some were pretty good and I did laugh while reading some. So a 3 it is. RIP, Harrison.

The final sequence is the almost inevitable theft from Tolkien of the Mines of Moria, but it's sufficiently exciting and well-done that unlike a similar theft in *The Sword of Shannara* I didn't put down the book in disgust.<br/><br/>*The Thousandfold Thought* was a sheer disappointment, and I did wonder whether to continue on to *The Judging Eye*, but I don't much regret it. The new characters are still pretty dubious (Mimara is just an annoyance), but the psychopathic son has real promise as a very dark inversion of Leto II.

Between the two, I would have to give it 2-3 stars.<br/><br/>The good part is that at the time, he was correct in puncturing or deflating a lot of the most hyperbolic claims about the benefits of computers and the Internet: online shopping did have a ways to go, kids' education was not being improved by computers (and may still not be), etc.<br/><br/>The bad part is, he was correct only in the short run. On many claims or predictions where he was absolutist, he is laughably wrong now, and we can expect his track record to continue to worsen as time passes.<br/><br/>This is actually a pretty common failure mode for skeptics of technologies: I call this the Amara effect, after Roy Amara: "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run."
