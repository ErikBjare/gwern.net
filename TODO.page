# Haskell
## Pandoc

- Write up what LaTeX Pandoc does understand; this can be found out by looking through the tests; figure out how the new TeXmath figures in

## XMonad

- Look through my collection of XMonad configuration files. What can be done in XMonad core and XMonadContrib to simplify them?
- `XMonad.WindowGo` and `WindowBring` could use quite a bit of refactoring and generalizing.
- Hlint XMC
- Run 'sim_text -d `find XMonadContrib/XMonad`' on XMC

# Programming (in general)

- English mode
    i. Get predictive completion
    ii. English indenting - implement visual-syntactic text formatting ([VSTF](http://www.readingonline.org/articles/r_walker/)) in Haskell (appears to've been commercialized as [LiveInk](http://www.liveink.com/)). Possibly using GF. Or perhaps some other Haskell library [Applications and libraries/Linguistics](!Hawiki).
- Programming challenges: [Sphere classical problems](http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/), [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), and [99 Haskell Problems](!Hawiki) (got to 11).
- [_How to Design Programs_](http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/); another Scheme textbook
- There's also [_Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics_](!Wikipedia "Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics"); is that best done before or after SICP?
- [Learn Prolog](http://www.learnprolognow.org/), [Adventure in Prolog](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/) - important paradigm; knowing Prolog, I can do this textbook on [partial evaluation/Futamura projections](http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/pebook/)
- Write a clone of [Zendo (game)](!Wikipedia). It looks fun and doable, and doing it well could draw on all sorts of GUI and AI techniques. [Zendo wiki](http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Zendo), [online version](http://superdupergames.org/povray/), [general page](http://www.koryheath.com/games/zendo); [automated analysis of Bongard problems](http://www.foundalis.com/res/diss_research.html) (apparently a very similar problem); [rule generator](http://web.archive.org/web/20091027133816/http://geocities.com/~karlvonl/Zendomizer.html)
- Learn TeX: [Help:Formula](!Wikipedia), <http://www.math.harvard.edu/texman/>, <http://sip.clarku.edu/tutorials/TeX/>
- Learn Java: [JR's tutorials](http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/jatutor0.htm); [JavaBat](http://www.javabat.com/)? Don't forget local copy of _Thinking in Java_

## Mnemosyne plugins:

- Spell-checker for adding cards
- Per-category 'vice-versa' setting

# General

- Look into throwing knives as a supplementary hobby to archery
- compile an equivalent of "[Suzanne Delage]()" but for _Peace_?
- Compile a [best of SL4](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/5n2/sl4_meta_list_closure_2_month_followup/452r) list of emails/reading list
- read through Akadot archives for _Eva_-related material: <http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/akadot.com/*>
- Learn some [physics](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01sc-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-2010/) (cf. _SCIM_)
- Learn statistics: <http://ipsur.r-forge.r-project.org/book/>
- Machine learning resources: <http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/186/>
- make dorodango: <http://www.dorodango.com/create.html>
