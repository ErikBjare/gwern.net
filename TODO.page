# Haskell

- Remove [Data.Map.map](!Hoogle); see [original](http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell-cafe@haskell.org/msg22115.html) [email thread](http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell-cafe@haskell.org/msg22055.html) and the GHC [bug report](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1249).

## Pandoc

- Write up what LaTeX Pandoc does understand; this can be found out by looking through the tests; figure out how the new TeXmath figures in

## XMonad

- Look through my collection of XMonad configuration files. What can be done in XMonad core and XMonadContrib to simplify them?
- XMonad.WindowGo and WindowBring could use quite a bit of refactoring and generalizing.
- Hlint XMC
- Run 'sim_text -d `find XMonadContrib/XMonad`' on XMC

## Darcs

- Add --pager option to 'darcs changes': this is a current [bug report](http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1303)

# Programming (in general)

- English mode
    i. Get predictive completion
    ii. English indenting - implement visual-syntactic text formatting ([VSTF](http://www.readingonline.org/articles/r_walker/)) in Haskell (appears to've been commercialized as [LiveInk](http://www.liveink.com/)). Possibly using GF. Or perhaps some other Haskell library [Applications and libraries/Linguistics](!Hawiki).
- Programming challenges: [Sphere classical problems](http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/), [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), and [99 Haskell Problems](!Hawiki) (got to 11).
- [_How to Design Programs_](http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/); another Scheme textbook
- There's also [_Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics_](!Wikipedia "Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics"); is that best done before or after SICP?
- [Learn Prolog](http://www.learnprolognow.org/), [Adventure in Prolog](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/) - important paradigm; knowing Prolog, I can do this textbook on [partial evaluation/Futamura projections](http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/pebook/)
- Write a clone of [Zendo (game)](!Wikipedia). It looks fun and doable, and doing it well could draw on all sorts of GUI and AI techniques. [Zendo wiki](http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Zendo), [online version](http://superdupergames.org/povray/), [general page](http://www.koryheath.com/games/zendo); [automated analysis of Bongard problems](http://www.foundalis.com/res/diss_research.html) (apparently a very similar problem); [rule generator](http://web.archive.org/web/20091027133816/http://geocities.com/~karlvonl/Zendomizer.html)
- Learn TeX: [Help:Formula](!Wikipedia), <http://www.math.harvard.edu/texman/>, <http://sip.clarku.edu/tutorials/TeX/>
- Learn Java: [JR's tutorials](http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/jatutor0.htm); [JavaBat](http://www.javabat.com/)? Don't forget local copy of _Thinking in Java_

## Mnemosyne plugins:

- Spell-checker for adding cards
- Metadata adder: in comment tags, add current date. TODO: is this actually necessary?
- Per-category 'vice-versa' setting

# General

- Look into throwing knives as a supplementary hobby to archery
- compile an equivalent of "[Suzanne Delage]()" but for _Peace_?
- Compile a [best of SL4](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/5n2/sl4_meta_list_closure_2_month_followup/452r) list of emails/reading list
- read through Akadot archives for _Eva_-related material: <http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/akadot.com/*>
- Learn some [physics](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01sc-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-2010/) (cf. _SCIM_)
- Learn statistics: <http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/forstudents/freecourses/statistics>, <http://ipsur.r-forge.r-project.org/book/>
- Machine learning resources: <http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/186/>
- make dorodango: <http://www.dorodango.com/create.html>

## Devices

- A direction sensor belt (a ring of vibrators around one's waist; the one closest to North buzzes gently). See the [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/esp.html) article on it, and a [2009 article](http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/enhanced/my-new-sense-organ) describing Sensebridge's Northpaw product  The [feelSpace](http://feelspace.cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/) homepage is here. There is a thread on [Hackers News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=609983) about building one's own. Here's a [version of the belt](http://www.exothermia.net/monkeys_and_robots/2009/02/04/on-the-haptic-compass/) made using [Arduino](!Wikipedia). There's a quasi-commercial version available for $119-214 from [Sensebridge](http://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw) ([video](http://vimeo.com/groups/45234/videos/11912761)), intended for wearing on one's ankle (the original ankle-based project is ["Noisebridge"](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Compass_Vibro_Anklet)). There's an [Arduino-based belt](http://www.gradman.com/hapticcompass), then there's a [_hat_](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Compass_Vibro_Anklet)! I think most approaches are just a little baroque; it might make more sense to have each vibrator be independent - with a vibrator, a compass, and a battery. After all, each one should be able to know independently of the others whether it is facing North or not.

- In the same vein as the feelSpace belt, it might be interesting to build a belt that vibrates in the direction of an desired object or location. Possible uses: in a library, it could buzz in the direction of a desired call #. Would be a cool project, anyway!
