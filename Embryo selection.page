The main constraints on selection profitability is the polygenic score; under the highest value, the NPV EVPI of a perfect SNP predictor is \$27b and the EVSI per education/SNP sample is \$71k
> - under the worst-case estimate, selection can be made profitable with a better polygenic score, which would require _n_>237,300 using education phenotype data (and much less using fluid intelligence measures)
> - selection can be made much more profitable by selecting on multiple phenotype traits; selection scales near-linearly with equally-valuable traits, and considering an example using 7 traits (IQ/height/BMI/diabetes/ADHD/bipolar/schizophrenia), there is a gain of 2.8x over IQ alone (\$4977 ~> \$14130)

# Embryo selection cost-effectiveness

[In vitro fertilization](!Wikipedia) (IVF) is a medical procedure for infertile women in which eggs are extracted, fertilized with sperm, allowed to develop into an embryo, and the embryo injected into their womb to induce pregnancy.
The choice of embryo is relatively random, with the best looking one implanted; various tests can be run on embryos, including genome sequencing, by extracting a few cells from the embryo.

[Preimplantation genetic profiling / preimplantation genetic diagnosis / preimplantation genetic screening](!Wikipedia "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis") (PGD; [review](/docs/genetics/2013-aa.pdf "'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis guided by single-cell genomics', Van der Aa et al 2013")) is when genetic information is taken and used to choose which embryo to implant.
Currently, embryos are screened for gross abnormalities like the wrong number of chromosomes which would either be fatal to the embryo's development or cause birth defects like [Down syndrome](!Wikipedia) (so there is no point in implanting it rather than a healthier embryo).

But with ever cheaper SNP arrays, large amounts of subtler genetic information becomes available, and one could check for abnormalities and also start making predictions about adult phenotypes, and one could choose embryos with higher/lower probability of traits with many known genetic hits such as [height](!Wikipedia "Human height") or intelligence or alcoholism or schizophrenia - thus, in effect, creating ["designer babies"](!Wikipedia "Designer baby#Preimplantation genetic diagnosis") with proven technology no more exotic than IVF and 23andMe.
For example, increases in height have [long been linked to increased career success & life satisfaction](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/the-financial-perks-of-being-tall/393518/ "The Financial Perks of Being Tall: An extra inch correlates with an estimated $800 in increased annual earnings") with estimates like +\$800 per inch per year income, which combined with polygenic scores predicting [60% of variance](http://neurogenetics.qimrberghofer.edu.au/papers/Wood2014NatGenet.pdf "'Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height', Wood et al 2014") and allowing increases of perhaps 4 inches. But height, or hair color, or other traits are in general zero-sum traits and far less important to life outcomes than personality or intelligence, which profoundly influence an enormous range of outcomes ranging from academic success to income to longevity to violence to happiness to altruism (and so increases in which are far from "frivolous", as some commenters have labeled them); since the personality GWASes have had difficulties (probably due to non-additivity of the relevant genes connected to the predicted frequency-dependent selection), that leaves intelligence as the most important case.

In ["Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game-changer?"](/docs/iq/2014-shulman.pdf), Shulman & Bostrom 2014 consider the potential of embryo selection for greater intelligence in a little detail, ultimately concluding that in the most applicable current scenario of minimal uptake (restricted largely to those forced into IVF use) and gains of a few IQ points, embryo selection is more of "curiosity" than "game-changer" as it will be "Socially negligible over one generation. Effects of social controversy more important than direct impacts."
Some things are left out of their analysis which I'm interested in:

1. they give the upper bound on the IQ gain that can be expected from a given level of selection & then-current imprecise GCTA heritability estimates, but not the gain that could be expected with updated figures: is it a large or small fraction of that maximum? And they give a general description of what societal effects might be expected from combinations of IQ gains and prevalence, but can we say something more rigorously about that?
2. their level of selection may bear little resemblance to what can be practically obtained given the realities of IVF and high embryo attrition rates (selecting from 1 in 10 embryos may yield _x_ IQ points, but how many real embryos would we need to implement that, since if we extract 10 embryos, 3 might be abnormal, the best candidate might fail to implant, the second-best might result in a miscarriage, etc?)
3. there is no attempt to estimate costs nor whether embryo selection right now is worth the costs, or how much better our selection ability would need to be to make it worthwhile. Are the advantages compelling enough that ordinary parents would pay for it and take the practice out of the lab?
3. if it is not worthwhile because the genetic information is too weakly predictive of adult phenotype, how much additional data would it take to make the predictions good enough to make selection worthwhile?
4. What are the prospects for embryo editing instead of selection, in theory and right now?

## Benefit
### Value of IQ

Shulman & Bostrom 2014 note that

> Studies in labor economics typically find that one IQ point corresponds to an increase in wages on the order of 1 per cent, other things equal, though higher estimates are obtained when effects of IQ on educational attainment are included ([Zax and Rees, 2002](http://www.colorado.edu/economics/papers/papers01/wp01-7.pdf "IQ, academic performance, environment, and earnings"); [Neal and Johnson, 1996](http://www.albany.edu/faculty/kretheme/PAD705/PastExams/JPE_RolePreMarketBWWageDiff.pdf "The role of premarket factors in black-white wage differences"); [Cawley et al., 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228308487_Cognitive_Ability_Wages_and_Meritocracy "Cognitive Ability, Wages, and Meritocracy"); [Behrman et al., 2004](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CP+-+Hunger+FINISHED.pdf "Copenhagen Consensus - Challenges and Opportunities: Hunger and Malnutrition"); [Bowles et al., 2002](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=econ_workingpaper "The determinants of individual earnings: Skills, preferences, and schooling"); [Grosse et al., 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240871/ "Economic Gains Resulting from the Reduction in Children's Exposure to Lead in the US")).^2^ The individual increase in earnings from a genetic intervention can be assessed in the same fashion as prenatal care and similar environmental interventions. One study of efforts to avert low birth weight estimated the value of a 1 per cent increase in earnings for a newborn in the US to be between \$2,783 and \$13,744, depending on discount rate and future wage growth ([Brooks-Gunn et al., 2009](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.597.7301&rep=rep1&type=pdf "Long-Run Economic Effects of Early Childhood Programs on Adult Earnings"))^[Brooks-Gunn et al 2009 doesn't report those specific figures; they are inferred from pg27, "Table A1.2 Present value for lifetime earnings of individuals with a high school degree or some college, estimated at birth", which is based on the 2006 March  Current Population Survey's sample with the average level of education. The estimated [net present value](!Wikipedia) for the worst-case (4% discounting, 0% wage growth) lifetime income is \$278,430, and the best-case (2% discount, 2% wage growth) is \$1,374,375. Using the earlier estimate that 1 point = +1% annual wages, then on average, 1 IQ point will translate to a NPV gain of \$2,783 and \$13,744 respectively.]

The given low/high range is based on 2006 data; [inflation-adjusted](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm "CPI Inflation Calculator") to 2016 dollars (as appropriate due to being compared to 2015/2016 costs), that would be \$3270 and \$16151.
There is much more that can be said on this topic, starting with various measurements of individuals from income to wealth to correlations with occupational prestige, looking at longitudinal & cross-sectional national wealth data, positive externalities & psychological differences (such as increasing cooperativeness, patience, free-market and moderate politics), verification of causality from longitudinal predictiveness, genetic overlap, within-family comparisons, & exogenous shocks positive (iodization & iron) or negative (lead), etc; an [incomplete bibliography is provided as an appendix](#iqincome-bibliography).
As polygenic scores & genetically-informed designs are slowly adopted by the social sciences, we can expect more known correlations to be confirmed as causally downstream of genetic intelligence.

Estimating the value of an additional IQ point is difficult as there are many perspectives one could take: zero-sum, including only personal earnings or wealth and neglecting all the wealthy produced for society (eg through research), often based on correlating income with intelligence scores or education; positive-sum, attempting to include the positive externalities, perhaps through cross or longitudinal global comparisons, as intelligence predicts later wealth and the wealth of a country is closely linked to the average intelligence of its population which captures many (but not all) of the positive externalities; measures which include the greater longevity & happiness of more intelligent people, etc.
Further, intelligence has intrinsic value of its own, and the genetic hits appear to be pleiotropic and improve other desirable traits; the intelligence/longevity correlation has been found to be due to common genetics, and [Krapohl et al 2015](http://www.hungrymindlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Krapohl-et-al-2015.pdf "Phenome-wide analysis of genome-wide polygenic scores") examines the correlation of polygenic scores with 50 diverse traits, finding that the college/IQ polygenic scores correlate with 10+ of them in generally desirable directions[^Krapohl-phenome], similar to [Hagenaars et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2015225a.html "Shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and physical and mental health in UK Biobank (N=112 151) and 24 GWAS consortia")[^Hagenaars-phenome] & [Hill et al 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/09/043000 "Molecular genetic contributions to social deprivation and household income in UK Biobank (n=112,151)"), indicating both causation for those correlations & benefits beyond income.
There are also pitfalls, like the fallacy of controlling for an intermediate variable, exemplified by studies which attempt to correlate intelligence with income after "controlling for" education, despite knowing that educational attainment is caused *by* intelligence and so their estimates are actually something irrelevant like 'the gain from greater intelligence for reasons other than through its effect on education'.
Estimates have come from a variety of sources, such as iodine and lead studies, using a variety of methodologies from cross-sectional surveys or administrative data up to natural experiments.
Given the difficulty of coming up with reliable estimates for 'the' value of an IQ point, which would be a substantial research project in its own right (but highly useful in other analyses like lead remediation or iodization), I will just reuse the \$3270-16151 range.

[^Krapohl-phenome]: More specifically, combining the College/Adult IQ/Child IQ polygenic scores and including the non-statistically-significant ones, I get out of Figure 1 :

    1. Better: _g_ / Raven's Progressive Matrices / Mill Hill Vocabulary / GCSE English / GCSE maths / GCSE science / PISA Attitudes to School / PISA homework Behaviour / PISA maths self-efficacy / PISA maths interest / PISA time spent on maths / Academic self-concept / Agreeableness / Conscientiousness / Extraversion / Neuroticism / Openness / Curiosity Flow / Chaos at Home / Attachment total / SDQ Total ([Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire](!Wikipedia); behavioral problems) / SDQ Conduct / SDQ Hyperactivity / SDQ Prosocial / Peer Victimization / Conners: Inattention / Conners: Impulsivity / Autism Quotient: Attention Switching / Autism Quotient: Imagination / Autism Quotient: Attention to Detail / Callous Unemotional Traits / ARBQ Anxiety / SANS (negative symptoms) / Grandiosity / Cognitive Disorganization / BMI / Height
    2. Neutral: PISA Homework total / Menarche / Puberty
    3. Worse: PISA Homework Feedback [?] / PISA time spent on maths [?] / GRIT / Curiosity Flow / Parental Control / Autism Quotient: Attention Switching / Grandiosity / Paranoid / Sleep total / Insomnia

    (In a few cases it's not clear how to interpret. Is less time on math a good or bad thing since the PISA & GCSE math scores are still higher?)
[^Hagenaars-phenome]: Hagenaars focused more on medical & psychiatric issues; breaking it down similarly across the 4 measures of cognitive functioning:

    1. better: Stroke: Cardioembolic / ADHD / Major depressive disorder / Blood pressure: diastolic / Blood pressure: systolic
    2. Mixed: Coronary artery disease / Stroke: ischaemic / Stroke: large vessel disease / Type 2 diabetes / Alzheimer's disease / Autism / Bipolar disorder / Schizophrenia / Hippocampal volume / Intracranial volume / Infant head circumference / BMI / Height / Longevity / FEV1
    3. Worse: none

### Polygenic scores for IQ
#### SNP

Shulman & Bostrom's upper bound works as follows:

> Standard practice today involves the creation of fewer than ten embryos. Selection among greater numbers than that would require multiple IVF cycles, which is expensive and burdensome. Therefore 1-in-10 selection may represent an upper limit of what would currently be practically feasible ...The standard deviation of IQ in the population is about 15. [Davies et al. (2011)](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/full/mp201185a.html "Genome-wide association studies establish that human intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic") estimates that common additive variation can account for half of variance in adult fluid intelligence in its sample. Siblings share half their genetic material on average. Thus, in a crude estimate, variance is cut by 75 per cent and standard deviation by 50 per cent. Adjustments for assortative mating, deviation from the Gaussian distribution, and other factors would adjust this estimate, but not drastically. These figures were generated by simulating 10 million couples producing the listed number of embryos and selecting the one with the highest predicted IQ based on the additive variation.
>
> Table 1. How the maximum amount of IQ gain (assuming a Gaussian distribution of predicted IQs among the embryos with a standard deviation of 7.5 points) might depend on the number of embryos used in selection:
>
> Selection    Average IQ gain
> ----------   ---------------
> 1 in 2       4.2
> 1 in 10      11.5
> 1 in 100     18.8
> 1 in 1000    24.3

That is, the full heritability of adult intelligence is ~0.8; a SNP chip records the few hundred thousand most common genetic variants in the population and treating each gene as having a simple additive increase-or-decrease effect on intelligence, Davies et al 2011's GCTA (Genome-wide complex trait analysis) estimates that those SNPs are responsible for 0.51 of variance; since siblings descend from the same two parents, they will share half the variants (just like dizygotic twins) and differ on the rest, so the SNPs can only predict up to 0.25 between siblings and siblings are analogous to multiple embryos being considered for implantation in IVF; simulate _n_ embryos by drawing from a normal distribution with a SD of 0.7 or 10.5 IQ points and selecting the highest, and with various _n_, you get something like the table.

(The [order statistic](!Wikipedia) expectation of the maximum ($E[Z]$) of a draw of _n_ samples from a normal distribution can be given [asymptotes & upper bounds](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/89030/expectation-of-the-maximum-of-gaussian-random-variables), the simplest [upper bound](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/89147) being $E[Z] \leq \sigma \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot log(n)}$ which makes the diminishing returns crystal clear.
However, it is inaccurate in small samples and simulations are more flexible.)

GCTA tells us how much the SNPs would explain if we knew all their effects exactly. This represents both an upper bound and a lower bound. It is a lower bound on heritability because:

- only SNPs are used, which are a subset of all genetic variation excluding variants found in <1% of the population, copy-number variations, extremely rare or de novo mutations, etc
- the SNPs are statistically treated in an additive fashion, ignoring any contribution they may make through [epistasis](!Wikipedia) and dominance, and not necessarily using any techniques which might boost genomic coverage like imputation based on whole-genomes (which [Yang et al 2015](/docs/genetics/2015-yang.pdf "Genetic variance estimation with imputed variants finds negligible missing heritability for human height and body mass index") argues could substantially increase the GCTA estimates)
- GCTA estimates typically include no correction for [measurement error](!Wikipedia) in the phenotype data: a short IQ test, or a proxy like years of education, will correlate imperfectly with intelligence. This can be adjusted by psychometric formulas using [test-retest reliability](!Wikipedia) to get a true estimate (eg a GCTA estimate of 0.33 based on a short quiz with _r_=0.5 reliability might actually imply a true GCTA estimate more like 0.5, implying one could find much more of the genetic variants responsible for intelligence by running a GWAS with better - but probably slower & more expensive - IQ testing methods).

So GCTA is a lower bound on the total genetic contribution to any trait; use of whole-genome data and more sophisticated analysis will allow predictions beyond the GCTA.
But the GCTA represents an upper bound on the state of the art approaches:

- there are many SNPs (likely into the thousands) affecting intelligence
- only a few are known to a high level of confidence, and the rest will take much larger samples to pin down
- relatively small SNP datasets used in additive modeling is most feasible in terms of computing power and implementations

So the current approaches of getting increasingly large SNP samples will not pass the GCTA ceiling.
Polygenic scores based on large SNP samples modeled additively are what is available in 2015, and in practice are nowhere near the GCTA ceiling; hence, the state of the art is well below the outlined maximum IQ gains.
Probably at some point whole-genomes will become cost-effective compared to SNPs, improvements be made in modeling interactions, and potentially much better polygenic scores will become available approaching the 0.8 of heritability; but not yet.

##### GCTA meta-analysis

Davies et al 2011's 0.5 is a little outdated and small, based on _n_=3511 with correspondingly large imprecision in the GCTA estimates.
I was able to find in total the following GCTA estimates:

0. ["Genome-wide association studies establish that human intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic"](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/full/mp201185a.html), Davies et al 2011 ([supplementary](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/extref/mp201185x1.doc))

  0.51(0.11); but Supplementary Table 1 (pg1) actually reports in the combined sample, the "no cut-off _g~f~_ _h_^2" equals 0.53(0.10). The 0.51 estimate is drawn from a cryptic relatedness cutoff of <0.025. The samples are also reported aggregated into Scottish & English samples: 0.17 (0.20) & 0.99 (0.22) respectively. Sample ages:

    1. Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (Scottish): _n_=550, 79.1 years average
    2. Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (Scottish): _n_=1091, 69.5 years average
    3. Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936 (Scottish): _n_=498, 64.6 years average
    4. Manchester and Newcastle longitudinal studies of cognitive aging cohorts (English): _n_=6063, 65 years median

    GCTA is not reported for the Norwegian, and not reported for the 4 samples individually, so I code Davies et al 2011 as 2 samples with weighted-averages for ages (70.82 and 65 respectively) <!-- (550*79.1 + 1091*69.5 + 498*64.6) / (550+1091+498) -->

    The article reports doing GCTAs only on the ARIC & HRS samples, but Figure 4 shows a forest plot which includes GCTA estimates from two other groups, CAGES ("Cognitive Ageing Genetics in England and Scotland Consortium") at ~0.5 & GS ("Generation Scotland") at ~0.25. The CAGES datapoint is cited to Davies et al 2011, which did report 0.51, and the GS citation is incorrect; so presumably those two datapoints were previously reported GCTA estimates which Davies et al 2015 was meta-analyzing together with their 2 new ARIC/HS estimates, and they simply didn't mention that.

The earlier estimates tend to be smaller samples and higher, and as heritability increases with age, it's not surprising that the GCTA estimates of SNP contribution also increases with age.
[Jian Yang](http://gcta.freeforums.net/thread/213/analysis-greml-results-multiple-cohorts) says that GCTA estimates can be meta-analytically combined straightforwardly in the usual way.
Excluding Chabris et al 2012 (no precision reported) and Spain et al 2015 and the duplicate Trzaskowski and doing a random-effects meta-analysis with mean age as a covariate:

(Oddly, the estimates decrease with age rather than increase.
I thought this might be driven by the samples using twins, which have been accused in the past of delivering higher heritability estimates due to higher SES of parents and correspondingly less environmental influence, but when added as a predictor, twin samples are non-statistically-significantly lower.
My best guess so far is that the apparent trend is due to a lack of middle-aged samples: the studies jump all the way from 14yo to 57yo, so the usual quadratic curve of increasing heritability could be hidden and look flat, since the high estimates will all be missing from the middle.)

![Forest plot for meta-analysis of GCTA estimates of total additive SNPs' effect on intelligence/cognitive-ability](/images/iq-gcta-forest.png)

This meta-analytic summary is an underestimate of the true genetic effect for several reasons, including as mentioned, measurement error.
Using Spearman's formula, we can correct it.

Davies et al 2016 is the most convenient and precise GCTA estimate to work with, and reports a test-retest reliability of 0.65 for its 13-question verbal-numerical reasoning test.
Its _h_^2^~snp~=0.31 is a square, so it must be square-rooted to be a _r_ and $\sqrt{0.31}=0.556$.
We assume the SNP test-retest reliability is ~1 as genome sequencing is highly accurate due to repeated passes.

The correction for attenuation is $r_{x'y'} = \frac{r_{xy}}{\sqrt{r_{xx} \cdot r_{yy}}}$

_x_/_y_ are IQ/SNPs, so:

$r_{x'y'} = \frac{\sqrt{0.31}}{\sqrt{1 \cdot 0.65}} = 0.691$

So the _r_~snp~ is 0.691, and to convert it back to _h_^2^~snp~, 0.691^2^ = 0.477481 = 0.48, which is substantially larger than the measurement-error-contaminated underestimate of 0.31.

0.48 represents the true underlying genetic contribution with indefinite amounts of exact data, but all IQ tests are imperfect and one may ask what is the practical limit with the best current IQ tests?

One of the best current IQ tests is the [WAIS-IV](!Wikipedia) full-scale IQ test, with [a 32-day test-retest reliability of 0.93 (Table 2)](http://images.pearsonclinical.com/images/pdf/wisciv/WISCIVTechReport2.pdf).
Knowing the true GCTA estimate, we can work backwards assuming a _r_~yy~=0.93:

We can then work backwards as I suggest to figure out what a good IQ test could deliver, such as the WAIS-IV full-scale IQ test.
So:

1. $r_{x'y'} = \frac{r_{xy}}{\sqrt{r_xx \cdot r_yy}}$
2. $0.691 = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{1 \cdot 0.93}}$
3. $0.691 \cdot \sqrt{1 \cdot 0.93} = \sqrt{x}$
4. $(0.691 \cdot \sqrt{1 \cdot 0.93})^2 = x$
5. $0.444 = x$

The better IQ test delivers a gain of 0.444-0.31=0.134 or 43% more possible variance explicable, with 4% still left over compared to a perfect test.

##### GCTA-based upper bound

Since half of additives will be shared within family, then we get `0.33*0.5 = 0.165` within-family variance, which gives `sqrt(0.165) = 0.4062019202` SD or 6.1 IQ points
(Occasionally within-family differences are cited in a format like "siblings have an average difference of 12 IQ points", which comes from an SD of ~0.7/0.8, since `0.8*15=12`, but you could also check what SD yields an average difference of 12 via simulation: eg `mean(abs(rnorm(n=10000000, mean=0, sd=0.71) - rnorm(n=10000000, mean=0, sd=0.71))) * 15 ~> 12.01807542`.)
We don't care about means since we're only looking at gains, so the mean of the within-family normal distribution can be set to 0.

With that, we can write a simulation like Shulman & Bostrom where we generate _n_ samples from N(0, 6.1), take the max, and return the difference of the max and mean.
For generality to other continuous normally-distributed complex traits, we'll work in standardized units rather than the IQ scale (SD=15), but convert back to points for easier reading:

~~~{.R}
## select 1 out of N siblings
embryoScores <- function(n, variance) { rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=sqrt(variance*0.5)); }
embryoSelectionGain <- function(n, variance) { scores <- embryoScores(n, variance)
                                               return(max(scores) - mean(scores)); }
simEmbryoSelection <- function(n=2, variance=0.33, iters=100000) { replicate(iters, embryoSelectionGain(n, variance)); }
mean(simEmbryoSelection(n=10)) * 15
# [1] 9.368836794
mean(simEmbryoSelection(n=10, variance=0.444)) * 15
# [1] 10.88073518
~~~

So 1 out of 10 gives a maximal average gain of ~9 IQ points, less than Shulman & Bostrom's 11.5 because of my lower GCTA estimate, but using better IQ tests like the WAIS, we could go as high as ~11 points.

For comparison, the full genetic heritability of adult IQ (including SNPs, mutation load & de novo mutations, copy-number variation, etc) is generally estimated ~0.8, which case the upper bound on selection out of 10 embryos would be ~14.5 IQ points:

~~~{.R}
mean(simEmbryoSelection(n=10, variance=0.8)) * 15
# [1] 14.61386652
~~~

##### Polygenic scores

A SNP-based polygenic score works much the same way: it explains a certain fraction or percentage of the variance, halved due to siblings, and can be plugged in once we know how much less than 0.33 it is.
An example of using SNP polygenic scores to identify genetic influences and verify they work within-family and are not confounded would be Domingue et al 2015's ["Polygenic Influence on Educational Attainment"](http://ero.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2332858415599972?full).
Past polygenic scores for intelligence:

1. ["Genome-wide association studies establish that human intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic"](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/full/mp201185a.html), Davies et al 2011:

    0.5776% of fluid intelligence in the NCNG replication sample, if I've understood their analysis correctly.
2. ["GWAS of 126,559 Individuals Identifies Genetic Variants Associated with Educational Attainment"](/docs/iq/2013-rietveld.pdf), Rietveld et al 2013:

    This landmark study providing the first GWAS hits on intelligence also estimated multiple polygenic scores: the full polygenic scores predicted 2% of variance in education, and 2.5% of variance in cognitive function in a Swedish replication sample, and also performed well in within-family settings (0.31% & 0.19% of variance in attending college & years of education, respectively, in [Table S25](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2013/05/29/science.1235488.DC1/Rietveld.SM.revision.2.pdf)).

    Predicts "0.2% to 0.4%" of variance in cognitive performance using a small polygenic score of 69 SNPs. (For other very small polygenic score uses, see also [Domingue et al 2015](http://ero.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2332858415599972?full "Polygenic Influence on Educational Attainment") & [Zhu et al 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chuansheng_Chen/publication/265855103_Educational_attainment-related_loci_identified_by_GWAS_are_associated_with_select_personality_traits_and_mathematics_and_language_abilities/links/542af5720cf27e39fa917a84.pdf "Educational attainment-related loci identified by GWAS are associated with select personality traits and mathematics and language abilities)").)

    Supplementary Table 4d reports predictive validity of the educational attainment polygenic score for childhood-cognitive-ability/college-degree/years-of-education in its other samples, yielding R^2^=0.0042/0.0214/0.0223 or 0.42%/2.14%/2.23% respectively. Particularly intriguing given its investigation of pleiotropy is Supplementary Table 5, which uses polygenic scores constructed for all the diseases in its data (eg type 2 diabetes, ADHD, schizophrenia, coronary artery disease), where all the disease scores & covariates are entered into the model and then the cognitive polygenic scores are able to predict even higher, as high as R^2^=0.063/0.046/0.064.
6. ["Genome-wide association study of cognitive functions and educational attainment in UK Biobank (_N_=112151)"](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201645a.html), Davies et al 2016:

    The Biobank polygenic score constructed for "verbal-numerical reasoning" predicted 0.98%/1.32% of _g_/_gf_ scores in Generation Scotland, and 2.79% in Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 ([Figure 2](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/mp201645f2.html#figure-title)).
5. Upcoming in 2016 is another SSGAC paper with ~8x hits using _n_=305,000 but [neither](http://drjamesthompson.blogspot.com/2015/09/scholar-in-86-snps.html) [talk's](http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2015/06/more-gwas-hits-on-cognitive-ability.html) summary gives the polygenic score. (The polygenic score will be much better than the Rietveld et al 2013 polygenic score, and I intend to rerun the numbers when it comes out and becomes the new public state of the art.) In a [March 2016 roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ANweXCptM "Steven Pinker, Stephen Hsu and Dalton Conley: Can Genius Be Genetically Engineered?"), a mention was made of an upcoming polygenic score explaining "about 8-10% of IQ".

Since these scores overlap and are not, like GCTA estimates, repeated measurements of a variable in any sense, there is little point in meta-analyzing them other than to estimate growth over time (even using them as an ensemble wouldn't be worth the complexity, and in any case, most studies do not provide the full list of beta values making up the polygenic score); for our purpose, the largest polygenic score is the important number.
([Emil Kirkegaard](http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=5813) notes that the polygenic scores are also inefficient: polygenic scores are not always published, not always based on individual patient data, and generally use maximum-likelihood estimation neglecting our strong priors on the number of hits & distribution of effect sizes. But these published scores are what we have as of January 2016, so we must make do.)

Rietveld et al 2013's reported polygenic score for cognitive performance was 2.5%.
Thus:

## Cost of embryo selection

PGD is currently [legal everywhere in the USA](!Wikipedia "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis#United States"), so there are no criminal or legal costs; even if there were, clinics in other countries will continue to offer it, and the cost of using a Chinese fertility clinic may not be particularly noticeable financially[^China-trip] and their quality may eventually be higher[^China-quality].

[^China-trip]: We could consider a hypothetical trip to China to make use of fertility clinics there. How much additional would one pay?

    Costs:

    - US passport costs ~\$110
    - a Chinese visa costs [\$140](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/visas/fees/t1236036.htm)
    - a Shanghai to San Francisco round-trip flight prices out currently in the range \$500-\$1000 (lower than I expected, perhaps due to the 2015 oil glut)
    - IVF is a long and involved process, so one should budget for at least 3 months residence: [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/money-costs) thinks that on a shoestring budget one can manage >\$30/day, so `3*31*30=$2790`.
    - IVF is also unpleasant enough that it would be wrong to consider those 3 months a vacation and one has to consider the impact of being away from one's job for such an extended period of time (as remote working is not an option for most people & the Great Firewall would impede that as well); so since 2013 US per capita income was \$53.8, those 3 months would cost on average somewhere <\$13.4k
    - Summing up: `110+140+2790+13400=$16.4k`.

    On the plus side:

    - Chinese IVF fertility clinics are presumably cheaper as well as more willing to do PGD. A [2011 NPR article](http://www.npr.org/2011/07/01/137530286/in-china-an-ivf-clinic-grapples-with-huge-demand) quotes a Chinese fertility clinic as offering 1 cycle at \$4.5k, which is around half of what a US clinic might charge (this halving likely would also be true for clinics in South Korean, Taiwanese, Thai etc); so the total penalty of going to China will depend on how many cycles are necessary. If 1 cycle, then it's \$10k vs \$16k+\$4.5k, a loss of -\$10.5k; for 2, -\$5k; for 3, +\$0.5k; and for 4, +\$6k, and so on.

        IVF cycle success rates being <41% and following a negative binomial, we can say that 2 or more cycles will be required, more often than not, and often 3 or 4, to get 1 live birth (after which it stops); one issue is that if a woman leaves as soon as pregnancy is confirmed with a fetal heartbeat, there may still be a miscarriage and they would have to decide whether to fly back to China and start another cycle, while if they stay for the full pregnancy, that triples food/hotel costs.
[^China-quality]: Quality-wise, Chinese fertility clinics may be behind Western clinics, but we can expect them to rapidly improve: the Chinese population is aging and becoming more affluent, the one-child policy is dead, and the Chinese government has made biology & genetic engineering a national strategic priority and bankrolled R&D and institutes like the [Beijing Genomics Institute](!Wikipedia). To quote [one article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-s-bold-push-into-genetically-customized-animals/ "China's Bold Push into Genetically Customized Animals: New kinds of dogs, goats and monkeys are being made quickly, although scientists voice worries about ethics and whether the methods should be used on humans") :

    > Dozens, if not hundreds, of Chinese institutions in both research hubs like Beijing and far-flung provincial outposts have enthusiastically deployed CRISPR. "It's a priority area for the Chinese Academy of Sciences," says Minhua Hu, a geneticist at the Guangzhou General Pharmaceutical Research Institute and one of the beagle researchers. A colleague, Liangxue Lai of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, adds that "China's government has allocated a lot of financial support in genetically modified animals in both [the] agriculture field [and the] biomedicine field."...The level and sophistication of work in China using CRISPR is already "about the same" as in Europe and the U.S., says [George Church](!Wikipedia "George M. Church"), a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. An analysis by Thomson Innovation, a division of London-based Thomson Reuters, found that more than 50 Chinese research institutions have filed gene-editing patents.

    [Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-23/china-bets-big-on-gene-editing-technology-in-race-against-u-s "China Builds a Faster Beagle in Gene-Editing Race With U.S."):

    > Chinese scientists say they were among the first in using Crispr to make [wheat resistant to a common fungal disease](http://host.cals.wisc.edu/horticulturedepartment/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2013/09/Wang-et-al.-2014.pdf "'Simultaneous editing of three homoeoalleles in hexaploid bread wheat confers heritable resistance to powdery mildew', Wang et al 2014"), dogs more muscular and pigs with leaner meat...Programs funded by Beijing are, among other things, working on disease-resistant tomatoes, breast cancer treatments and increasing the oil content in soy beans..."I would rank the U.S. and China as first and second Crispr-Cas9 research countries, respectively, at this time. Both countries have much strength in this area," said Paul Knoepfler..."The U.S. currently gets the edge in high-profile papers, Crispr biotech and intellectual property. China has published a lot in Crispr animals."...Most of China's funding for Crispr research is coming from the government, with very few private companies putting money into gene modification work, said Lai Liangxue, deputy director of the Southern China Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. "Whether it's animal or plant, our country has special funds for this aspect of work." Last year, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a prominent government backed institution that funds research, awarded more than 23 million yuan (\$3.5 million) to at least 42 Crispr projects, more than double the previous year. It is just one of several government institutions providing Crispr funding in China. China is also aided by a large pool of internationally trained scientists, many of whom have returned home after working overseas...Crispr has already boosted a new industry in China that supplies genetically edited animals to foreign research labs and pharmaceutical companies. Researchers in the U.S. and China also see its potential in agriculture -- to potentially create disease resistant grains or better quality meat. Raising a genetically engineered pig with Crispr technology is already cheaper in China at about 700,000 yuan, while in the U.S. it could cost four or five times as much, said Lai. Labor and other costs are lower in China.

    On [future autism work](http://www.nature.com/news/monkeys-genetically-modified-to-show-autism-symptoms-1.19228 "Monkeys genetically modified to show autism symptoms: But it is unclear how well the results match the condition in humans"):

    > Next, the researchers plan to use the CRISPR gene-editing technique to knock out the extra _MECP2_ copies in cells in those regions and then check whether the autism-like symptoms stop...If non-human primates prove to be a useful model for psychiatric disorders, China and other countries that are investing heavily in research on monkeys, such as Japan, could gain an edge in brain research. Muotri says that such studies probably wouldn't be done in the United States, for example, where research on non-human primates is more expensive and controversial than it is in Japan or China. "China and Japan have a clear advantage over the US on this area," he says.

    They are expected to approve agricultural-related modifications before the USA; [_Nature_](http://www.nature.com/news/super-muscly-pigs-created-by-small-genetic-tweak-1.17874 "Super-muscly pigs created by small genetic tweak: Researchers hope the genetically engineered animals will speed past regulators"):

    > Kim hopes to market the edited pig sperm to farmers in China, where demand for pork is on the rise. The regulatory climate there may favour his plan. China is investing heavily in gene editing and historically has a lax regulatory system, says Ishii. Regulators will be cautious, he says, but some might exempt genetic engineering that does not involve gene transfer from strict regulations. "I think China will go first," says Kim.

    So overall, I think we can say that on average, doing IVF in China is not as financially costly as it seems up front and could even be profitable. Which leaves the more psychological issues of trust and planning and willingness to go overseas, which are hard to evaluate in the absence of any present incentive to do Chinese genetic-engineering birth tourism, but [medical tourism](!Wikipedia) and [birth tourism](!Wikipedia) are both already phenomena.

### Cost of polygenic scores

An upper bound is the cost of whole-gnome sequencing, which has continuously fallen. My impression is that historically, a whole-genome has cost ~6x a comprehensive SNP (500k+).
The [NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program's DNA Sequencing Cost dataset](http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) most recently records an [October 2015 whole-genome cost of \$1245](http://www.genome.gov/pages/der/seqcost2015_4.xlsx).
Illumina has boasted about a \$1000 whole-genome starting around 2014 (under an unspecified cost model), and around December 2015, Veritas Genetics started taking orders for a consumer 20x whole-genome priced at \$1000.
So if a comprehensive SNP cost >\$1000, it would be cheaper to do a whole-genome, and historically at that price, we would expect a SNP cost of ~\$170.

The date & cost of getting a large selection of SNPs is not collected in any dataset I know of, so here are a few 2014-2016 price quotes.
Hsu 2014 estimates an SNP costs "~\$100 USD" and "At the time of this writing SNP genotyping costs are below \$50 USD per individual", without specifying a source; given the latter is below any 23andMe price offered, it is probably an internal Beijing Genomics Institute cost estimate.
The [Center for Applied Genomics price list](https://caglab.org/index.php/for-researchers/pricing-and-services.html) (unspecified date but presumably 2015) lists [Affymetrix SNP 6.0](http://www.affymetrix.com/catalog/131533/AFFY/Genome-Wide+Human+SNP+Array+6.0) at \$355 & the [Human Omni Express-24](http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/brochures/datasheet_omni_whole-genome_arrays.pdf) at \$170.
23andMe famously offered its services for \$108.95 for >600k SNPs as of October 2014, but that price apparently was substantially subsidized by research & sales as they raised the price to \$200 & lowered comprehensiveness in October 2015.
[NIH CIDR's price list](http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/services/pricing.pdf) quotes a full cost of \$150-\$210 for 1 use of a [UK Biobank](!Wikipedia) 821K SNP Axiom Array ([capabilities](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UK-Biobank-Axiom-Array-Content-Summary-2014.pdf)) as of 10 December 2015. (The NIH CIDR price list also says \$40 for 96 SNPs, suggesting that it would be a false economy to try to get only the top few SNP hits rather than a comprehensive polygenic score.)
[Rockefeller University's 2016 price list](http://www.rockefeller.edu/genomics/pricing) quotes a range of \$260-\$520 for one sample from an Affymetrix GeneChip.
Tan et al 2014 note that for PGD purposes, "the estimated reagent cost of sequencing for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities is currently less than \$100."
The price of the array & genotyping can be driven far below this by economies of scale: [Hugh Watkins's talk at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R_DICKkMfo "Genotyping - UK Biobank array on 500,000 participants") [June 2014 UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/frontiers-meeting-london-2014/) conference says that they had reached a cost of ~\$45 per SNP^[See starting 2:15: "This was a huge project. You take it for granted now but it was almost unimaginable a year or two ago...So the array that I will come to actually came in at about £32 for the array and the genotyping per person. An astonishingly low sum compared to what it would have been three years ago." 3:55: "The economies of scale are astonishing. This was a bespoke new array, I'll explain more in subsequent slides, and the fact that the order was coming in for half a million arrays drove the price down below anything you might have expected...The industrial providers really worked hard for something of this scale, very competitive tenders came in from different providers and the one that was selected was unsurprisingly the same for both, Affymetrix. Which I might not have expected but they made a truly impressive effort."]

Overall, SNPing an embryo in 2016 should cost ~\$100-400 and more like \$200 and we can expect the SNP cost to fall further.

#### SNP cost forecast

How much will SNP costs drop in the future?

We can extrapolate from the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program's DNA Sequencing Cost dataset, but it's tricky: eyeballing [their graph](http://www.genome.gov/images/content/costpergenome2015_4.jpg "NHGRI cost per genome, 2001-2015"), we can see that historical prices have not followed any single pattern.
At first, costs closely tracks a simple halving every 18 months, then there is an abrupt trend-break to super-exponential drops from mid-2007 to mid-2011 and then an equally abrupt reversion to a flat cost trajectory with occasional price *increases* and then another abrupt fall in early 2015 (accentuated when one adds in the Veritas Genetics \$1k as a datapoint).

Dropping pre-2007 data and fitting an exponential shows a bad fit since 2012 (if it follows the pre-2015 curve, it has large prediction errors on 2015-2016 and vice-versa).
It's probably better to take the last 3 datapoints (the current trend) and fit the curve to them, covering just the past 6 months since July 2015, and then applying the 6x rule of thumb we can predict SNP costs out 20 months to October 2017:

~~~

(Even if SNP prices stagnate due to lack of competition or fixed-costs/overhead/small-scales, whole-genomes will simply eat their lunch: at the current trend, whole-genomes will reach \$200 ~2019 and \$100 ~2020.)

### PGD net costs

An IVF cycle involving PGD will need ~4-5 SNPs (given a median egg count of 9 and half being abnormal), so I estimate the genetic part costs ~\$800-1000.
The net cost of PGD will include the cell harvesting part (one needs to extract cells from embryos to sequence) and interpretation (although scoring and checking the genetic data for abnormality should be automatable), so we can compare with current PGD price quotes.

- "The Fertility Institutes" say ["Average costs for the medical and genetic portions of the service provided by the Fertility Institutes approach \$27,000 U.S"](http://www.fertility-docs.com/programs-and-services/pgd-screening/genetic-diagnosis-of-embryos-for-diseases-using-pgd.php) (unspecified date) without breaking out the PGD part
- [Genetic Alliance UK](http://www.geneticalliance.org.uk/aboutpgd.htm#Question6) claims (in 2012, based on PDF creation date) that "The cost of PGD is typically split into two parts: procedural costs (consultations, laboratory testing, egg collection, embryo transfer, ultrasound scans, and blood tests) and drug costs (for ovarian stimulation and embryo transfer). PGD combined with IVF will cost £6,000 [\$8.5k] - £9,000 [\$12.8k] per treatment cycle." but doesn't specify the marginal cost of the PGD rather than IVF part
- [Alzforum](http://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/preimplantation-genetic-diagnosis-its-no-walk-park "Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis: It's No Walk in the Park") (July 2014): "In Madison, Wisconsin, genetic counselor Margo Grady at Generations Fertility Care estimated the out-of-pocket price of one IVF cycle at about \$12,000, and PGD adds another \$3,000."
- [Reproductive Health Technologies Project](http://www.rhtp.org/fertility/pgd/) (2015?): "One round of IVF typically costs around \$9,000. PGD adds another \$4,000 to \$7,500 to the cost of each IVF attempt. A standard round of IVF results in a successful pregnancy only 10-35% of the time (depending on the age and health of the woman), and a woman may need to undergo subsequent attempts to achieve a viable pregnancy."
- [SDFC](https://www.sdfertility.com/fertility-treatments/genetic-testing/pgd) (2015?): "PGD typically costs between \$4,000-\$10,000 depending on the cost of creating the specific probe used to detect the presence of a single gene."
- Murugappan et al May 2015: "The average cost of PGS was \$4,268 (range \$3,155-\$12,626)", citing another study which estimated "Average additional cost of PGD procedure: \$3,550; Median Cost: \$3,200"
- the [Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago](http://www.advancedfertility.com/pgd-costs.htm) ("current" pricing, so 2015?) says IVF costs ~$12k and of that, "Aneuploidy testing (for chromosome normality) with PGD is \$1800 to \$5000...PGD costs in the US vary from about \$4000-\$8000". AFC usefully breaks down the costs further in a table of "Average PGS IVF Costs in USA", saying that:

    > - Embryo biopsy charges are about \$1000 to \$2500 (average: \$1500)
    > - Embryo freezing costs are usually between \$500 to \$1000 (average: \$750)
    > - Aneuploidy testing (for chromosome normality) with PGD is \$1800 to \$5000
    > - For single gene defects (such as cystic fibrosis), there are additional costs involved.
    > - PGS test cost average: \$3500

    (The wording is unclear about whether these are costs per *embryo* or per *batch* of embryos; but the rest of the page implies that it's per batch, and per embryo would imply that the other PGS cost estimates are either far too low or are being done on only one embryo & likely would fail.)

From the final AFC costs, we can see that the genetic testing makes up a large fraction of the cost.
Since custom markers are not necessary and we are only looking at standard SNPs, the \$1.8-5k genetic cost is a huge overestimate of the \$1k the SNPs should cost now or soon.
Their breakdown also implies that the embryo freezing/vitrification cost is counted as part of the PGS cost, but I don't think this is right since one will need to store embryos regardless of whether one is doing PGS/selection (even if an embryo is going to be implanted right away in a live transfer, the other embryos need to be stored since the first one will probably fail).
So the critical number here is that the embryo biopsy step costs \$1500; there is probably little prospect of large price decreases here and we can take it as fixed.

Hence we can model the cost of embryo selection as a fixed \$1.5k cost plus number of embryos times SNP cost.

## Modeling embryo selection

[In vitro fertilization](!Wikipedia) is a sequential probabilistic process:

1. harvest _x_ eggs
2. fertilize them and create _x_ embryos
3. culture the embryos to either cleavage (2-4 days) or blastocyst (5-6 days) stage; of them, _y_ will still be alive & not grossly abnormal
4. freeze the embryos
5. optional: embryo selection using quality and PGS
6. unfreeze & implant 1 embryo; if no embryos left, return to #1 or give up
7. if no live birth, go to #6

(Each step is necessary and determines input into the next step; it is a 'leaky pipeline', whose total yield depends heavily on the least efficient step, so outcomes might be [distributed log-normally](!Wikipedia "Log-normal distribution").)
A simulation of this process:

~~~{.R}
simulateIVF <- function (eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP=0.5, vitrificationP, liveBirth) {
  eggsExtracted <- max(0, round(rnorm(n=1, mean=eggMean, sd=eggSD)))

  normal        <- rbinom(1, eggsExtracted, prob=normalityP)

  scores        <- embryoScores(n=normal, variance=polygenicScoreVariance)

  survived      <- Filter(function(x){rbinom(1, 1, prob=vitrificationP)}, scores)

  selection <- sort(survived, decreasing=TRUE)
  if (length(selection)>0) {
   for (embryo in 1:length(selection)) {
   if (rbinom(1, 1, prob=liveBirth) == 1) {
     live <- selection[embryo]
     return(live)
     }
     }
    }
  }
simulateIVFs <- function(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth, iters=100000) {
  return(unlist(replicate(iters, simulateIVF(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth)))); }
~~~

The transition probabilities can be estimated from the flows reported in papers dealing with IVF and PGD. I have used:

1. ["Clinical outcome of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening using next generation sequencing"](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/pdf/2047-217X-3-30.pdf), Tan et al December 2014:

    395 women, 1512 eggs successfully extracted & fertilized into blastocysts (~3.8 per woman); after genetic testing, 256+590=846 or 55% were abnormal & could not be used, leaving 666 good ones; all were vitrified for storage during analysis and 421 of the normal ones rethawed, leaving 406 useful survivors or ~1.4 per woman; the 406 were implanted into 252 women, yielding 24+75=99 healthy live births or 24% implanted-embryo->birth rate. Excerpts:

    > A total of 395 couples participated. They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age. A total of 1,512 blastocysts were biopsied on D5 after fertilization, with 1,058 blastocysts set aside for SNP array testing and 454 blastocysts for NGS testing. In the NGS cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 52.6% (60/114), 61.3% (49/80) and 14.3% (7/49), respectively. In the SNP array cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 47.6% (139/292), 56.7% (115/203) and 14.8% (17/115), respectively. The outcome measures of both the NGS and SNP array cycles were the same with insignificant differences. There were 150 blastocysts that underwent both NGS and SNP array analysis, of which seven blastocysts were found with inconsistent signals. All other signals obtained from NGS analysis were confirmed to be accurate by validation with qPCR. The relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for each blastocyst that underwent NGS testing was evaluated, and a significant difference was found between the copy number of mtDNA for the euploid and the chromosomally abnormal blastocysts. So far, out of 42 ongoing pregnancies, 24 babies were born in NGS cycles; all of these babies are healthy and free of any developmental problems.
    >
    > ...The median number of normal/ balanced embryos per couple was 1.76 (range from 0 to 8)...Among the 129 couples in the NGS cycles group, 33 couples had no euploid embryos suitable for transfer; 75 couples underwent embryo transfer and the remaining 21 couples are currently still waiting for transfer. In the SNP array cycles group, 177 couples underwent embryo transfer, 66 couples had no suitable embryos for transfer, and 23 couples are currently still waiting. Of the 666 normal/balanced blastocysts, 421 blastocysts were warmed after vitrification, 406 survived (96.4% of survival rate) and were transferred in 283 cycles. The numbers of blastocysts transferred per cycle were 1.425 (114/80) and 1.438 (292/203) for NGS and SNP array, respectively. The proportion of transferred embryos that successfully implanted was evaluated by ultrasound 6-7 weeks after embryo transfer, indicating that 60 and 139 embryos resulted in a fetal sac, giving implantation rates of 52.6% (60/114) and 47.6% (139/292) for NGS and SNP array, respectively. Prenatal diagnosis with karyotyping of amniocentesis fluid samples did not find any fetus with chromosomal abnormalities. A total of 164 pregnancies were detected, with 129 singletons and 35 twins. The clinical pregnancy rate per transfer cycle was 61.3% (49/80) and 56.7% (115/203) for NGS and SNP array, respectively (Table 3). A total of 24 miscarriages were detected, giving rates of 14.3% (7/49) and 14.8% (17/115) in NGS and SNP array cycles, respectively
    >
    > ...The ongoing pregnancy rates were 52.5% (42/80) and 48.3% (98/203) in NGS and SNP array cycles, respectively. Out of these pregnancies, 24 babies were delivered in 20 NGS cycles; so far, all the babies are healthy and chromosomally normal according to karyotype analysis. In the SNP array cycles group the outcome of all pregnancies went to full term and 75 healthy babies were delivered (Table 3)...NGS is with a bright prospect. A case report described the use of NGS for PGD recently [33]. Several comments for the application of NGS/MPS in PGD/PGS were published [34,35]. The cost and time of sequencing is already competitive with array tests, and the estimated reagent cost of sequencing for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities is currently less than \$100.
2. ["Cost-effectiveness analysis of preimplantation genetic screening and in vitro fertilization versus expectant management in patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss"](/docs/genetics/2015-murugappan.pdf), Murugappan et al May 2015:

    > Probabilities for clinical outcomes with IVF and PGS in RPL patients were obtained from a 2012 study by Hodes-Wertz et al. (10). This is the single largest study to date of outcomes using 24-chromosome screening by array comparative genomic hybridization in a well-defined RPL population...The Hodes-Wertz study reported on outcomes of 287 cycles of IVF with 24-chromosome PGS with a total of 2,282 embryos followed by fresh day-5 embryo transfer in RPL patients. Of the PGS cycles, 67% were biopsied on day 3, and 33% were biopsied on day 5. The average maternal age was 36.7 years (range: 21-45 years), and the mean number of prior miscarriages was 3.3 (range: 2-7). From 287 PGS cycles, 181 cycles had at least one euploid embryo and proceeded to fresh embryo transfer. There were 52 cycles with no euploid embryos for transfer, four cycles where an embryo transfer had not taken place at the time of analysis, and 51 cycles that were lost to follow-up observation. All patients with a euploid embryo proceeded to embryo transfer, with an average of 1.65 Æ 0.65 (range: 1-4) embryos per transfer. Excluding the cycles lost to follow-up evaluation and the cycles without a transfer at the time of analysis, the clinical pregnancy rate per attempt was 44% (n 1⁄4 102). One attempt at conception was defined as an IVF cycle and oocyte retrieval Æ embryo transfer. The live-birth rate per attempt was 40% (n1⁄4 94), and the miscarriage rate per pregnancy was 7% (n 1⁄4 7). Of these seven miscarriages, 57% (n 1⁄4 4) occurred after detection of fetal cardiac activity (10). Information on the percent- age of cycles with surplus embryos was not provided in the Hodes-Wertz study, so we drew from their database of 240 RPL patients with 118 attempts at IVF and PGS (12). The clinical pregnancy, live-birth, and clinical miscarriage rates did not statistically significantly differ between the outcomes published in the Hodes-Wertz study (P1⁄4 .89, P1⁄4 .66, P1⁄4 .61, respectively). We reported that 62% of IVF cycles had at least one surplus embryo (12).
    >
    > ...The average cost of preconception counseling and baseline RPL workup, including parental karyotyping, maternal antiphospholipid antibody testing, and uterine cavity evaluation, was \$4,377 (range: \$4,000-\$5,000) (16). Because this was incurred by both groups before their entry into the decision tree, it was not included as a cost input in the study. The average cost of IVF was \$18,227 (range: \$6,920-\$27,685) (16) and includes cycle medications, oocyte retrieval, and one embryo transfer. The average cost of PGS was \$4,268 (range \$3,155-\$12,626) (17), and the average cost of a frozen embryo transfer was \$6,395 (range: \$3,155-\$12,626) (13, 16). The average cost of managing a clinical miscarriage with dilation and curettage (D&C) was \$1,304 (range: \$517-\$2,058) (18). Costs incurred in the IVF-PGS strategy include the cost of IVF, PGS, fresh embryo transfer, frozen embryo transfer, and D&C. Costs incurred in the expectant management strategy include only the cost of D&C.

Of these, 2580 (41.8%) were carried out for PGD purposes, in which 1597 cycles were performed for single-gene disorders, including HLA typing. An additional 3551 (57.6%) cycles were carried out for PGS purposes and 29 (0.5%) for PGS-SS. 22 Although the ESHRE data represent only a partial record of the PGD cases conducted worldwide, it is indicative of general trends in the field of PGD.

    > ...At least 40% to 60% of human embryos are abnormal, and that number increases to 80% in women 40 years or older. These abnormalities result in low implantation rates in embryos transferred during IVF procedures, from 30% in women < 35 years to 6% in women ≥ 40 years. 33 In a recent retrospective review of trophectoderm biopsies, aneuploidy risk was evident with increasing female age. A slightly increased prevalence was noted at younger ages, with > 40% aneuploidy in women ≤ 23 years. The risk of having no chromosomally normal blastocyst for transfer (the no-euploid embryo rate) was lowest (2-6%) in women aged 26 to 37, then rose to 33% at age 42 and reached 53% at age 44. 11

    > ...The largest group of women using ART services were women younger than age 35, representing approximately 38% of all ART cycles performed in 2013. About 20% of ART cycles were performed among women aged 35-37, 19% among women aged 38-40, 11% among women aged 41-42, 7% among women aged 43-44, and 5% among women older than age 44. Figure 4 shows that, in 2013, the type of ART cycles varied by the woman's age. The vast majority (97%) of women younger than age 35 used their own eggs (non-donor), and about 4% used donor eggs. In contrast, 38% of women aged 43-44 and 73% of women older than age 44 used donor eggs.

    > ...Outcomes of ART Cycles Using Fresh Non-donor Eggs or Embryos, by Stage, 2013:
    >
    > 1. 93,787 cycles started
    > 2. 84,868 retrievals
    > 3. 73,571 transfers
    > 4. 33,425 pregnancies
    > 5. 27,406 live-birth deliveries

    CDC report doesn't specify how many eggs on average are retrieved or abnormality rate by age, although we can note that ~10% of retrievals didn't lead to any transfers (since there were 85k retrievals but only 74k transfers) which looks consistent with an overall mean & SD of 9(4.6) and 50% abnormality rate.
    We could also try to back out from the figures on average number of embryos per transfer, number of transfers, and number of cycles (eg 1.8 for <35yos, and 33750, so 60750 transferred embryos, as part of the 40083 cycles, indicating each cycle must have yielded at least 1.5 embryos), but that only gives a loose lower bound since there may be many left over embryos and the abnormality rate is unknown.

    So for an American model of <35yos (the chance of IVF success declines so drastically with age that it's not worth considering older age brackets), we could go with a set of parameters like {9, 4.6, 0.5, 0.96, 0.28}.

With these sets of data, we can fill in parameter values for the simulation and estimate gains.

Using the Tan et al 2014 data:

1. eggs extracted per person: normal distribution, mean=3, SD=4.6 (discretized into whole numbers)
2. using previous simulation, 'SNP test' all eggs extracted for polygenic score
2. P=0.5 that an egg is normal
3. P=0.96 that it survives vitrification
4. P=0.24 that an implanted egg yields a birth

~~~{.R}
simulateTan <- function() { return(simulateIVFs(3, 4.6, rietveld2013, 0.5, 0.96, 0.24)); }
iqTan <- mean(simulateTan()) * 15; iqTan
# [1] 0.3169408043
~~~

That is, the couples in Tan et al 2014 would have seen a 0.3IQ increase.

The Murugappan et al 2015 cost-benefit analysis uses data from American fertility clinics reported in [Hodes-Wertz's "Idiopathic recurrent miscarriage is caused mostly by aneuploid embryos"](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamie_Grifo/publication/225286057_Idiopathic_recurrent_miscarriage_is_caused_mostly_by_aneuploid_embryos/links/00b4951fbe350b4300000000.pdf):
278 cycles yielding 2282 blastocysts or ~8.2 on average; 35% normal; there is no mention of losses to cryostorage, so I borrow 0.96 from Tan et al 2015; 1.65 implanted on average in 181 transfers, yielding 40% live-births.
So:

~~~{.R}
simulateHodesWertz <- function() { return(simulateIVFs(8.2, 4.6, rietveld2013, 0.35, 0.96, 0.40)) }
iqHW <- mean(simulateHodesWertz()) * 15; iqHW
# [1] 0.5666326846
~~~

Both Tan et al 2014 and Hodes-Wertz et al 2012 are unrepresentative, since they focused on subjects with particular difficulties or low genetic quality ("They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age", and "Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more failed pregnancies" respectively).
The more nationally representative USA data from the CDC reports net numbers rather than per step, but using the imputed probabilities:

~~~{.R}
simulateUSA <- function(liveBirth) { return(simulateIVFs(9, 4.6, rietveld2013, 0.3, 0.90, liveBirth)); };
iqUSA <- sapply(c(10.8, 8.6, 5.7, 3.2, 1.56, 0.49)/100, function(lb){mean(simulateUSA(lb))*15;}); iqUSA

### Societal effects

One category of effects considered by Shulman & Bostrom is the non-financial social & societal effects mentioned in their Table 3, where embryo selection can "perceptibly advantage a minority" or in an extreme case, "Selected dominate ranks of elite scientists, attorneys, physicians, engineers. Intellectual Renaissance?"
This is another point which is worth going into a little more; no specific calculations are mentioned by Shulman & Bostrom, and the thin-tail-effects of normal distributions are notoriously counterintuitive, with surprisingly large effects out on the tails from small-seeming changes in means or standard deviations - for example, the legendary levels of Western Jewish overperformance despite their tiny population sizes.

As a general rule of thumb, 'elite' groups like scientists, attorneys, physicians, Ivy League students etc are highly selected for intelligence - one can comfortably estimate averages >=130 IQ (+2SD) from past IQ samples & average SAT scores & the ever-increasingly stringent admissions; and elite performance continues to increase with increasing intelligence as high as can reasonably be measured, as indicated by available date like the SMPY longitudinal study (many papers but see [Wai et al 2005](http://tip.duke.edu/sites/default/files/Creativity%20and%20Occupational%20Accomplishments%20Among%20Intellectually%20Precocious%20Youths.pdf "Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study"), [Lubinski & Benbow 2006](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/DoingPsychScience20061.pdf "Study of mathematically precocious youth after 35 years: Uncovering antecedents for the development of math-science expertise"), [Park et al 2007](http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/ETD-db/available/etd-12062007-195216/unrestricted/01thesisES.pdf "Contrasting intellectual patterns predict creativity in the arts and sciences tracking intellectually precocious youth over 25 years"), [Wai et al 2009](http://tip.duke.edu/sites/default/files/Spatial%20Ability%20for%20STEM%20Domains.pdf "Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of Cumulative Psychological Knowledge Solidifies Its Importance"), [Kell et al 2013](/docs/iq/2013-kell.pdf "Who rises to the top? Early indicators")), where we might define the cut off as 160 IQ based on [Anne Roe](!Wikipedia)'s study of the most eminent available scientists (mean ~150-160)[^Roe].
So to estimate an impact, one could consider a question like: given an average boost of _x_ IQ points through embryo-selection, how much would the odds of being elite (>=130) or extremely elite (>=160) increase for the selected? If a certain fraction of IVFers were selected, what fraction of all people above the cutoff would they make up?

If there are 320 million people in the USA, then about 17m are +2SD and 43k are +3SD:

~~~{.R}
dnorm((130-100)/15) * 320000000
# [1] 17277109.28
dnorm((160-100)/15) * 320000000
# [1] 42825.67224
~~~

Similarly, in 2013, the [CDC reports](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/births.htm) 3,932,181 children born in the USA; and the 2013 CDC annual IVF report says that 67,996 (1.73%) were IVF.
This implies that IVFers also make up a very small number of highly gifted children:

~~~{.R}
size <- function(mean, cutoff, populationSize, useFraction=1) { if(cutoff>mean) { dnorm(cutoff-mean) * populationSize * useFraction } else
                                                                 { (1 - dnorm(cutoff-mean)) * populationSize * useFraction }}
size(0, (60/15), 67996)
# [1] 9.099920031
~~~

So assuming IVF parents average 100IQ, then we can take the embryo selection theoretical upper bound of +9.36 (+0.624SD) corresponding to the "aggressive IVF" set of scenarios in Table 3 of Shulman & Bostrom, and ask, if 100% of IVF children were selected, how many additional people over 160 would that create?

~~~{.R}
eliteGain <- function(ivfMean, ivfGain, ivfFraction, generation, cutoff, ivfPop, genMean, genPop) {

              ivfers      <- size(ivfMean,                      cutoff, ivfPop, 1)
              selected    <- size(ivfMean+(ivfGain*generation), cutoff, ivfPop, ivfFraction)
              nonSelected <- size(ivfMean,                      cutoff, ivfPop, 1-ivfFraction)
              gain        <- (selected+nonSelected) - ivfers

              population <- size(genMean, cutoff, genPop)
              multiplier <- gain / population
              return(multiplier) }
eliteGain(0, (9.36/15), 1, 1, (60/15), 67996, 0, 3932181)
# [1] 0.1554096565
~~~

In this example, the +0.624SD boosts the absolute number by 82 people, representing 15.5% of children passing the cutoff; this would mean that IVF overrepresentation would be noticeable if anyone went looking for it, but would not be a major issue nor even as noticeable as Jewish achievement. We would indeed see "Substantial growth in educational attainment, income", but we would not see much effect beyond that.

Is it realistic to assume that IVF children will be distributed around a mean of 100 sans any intervention? That seems unlikely, if only due to the substantial financial cost of using IVF; however, the existing literature is inconsistent, showing both higher & lower education or IQ scores ([Hart & Norman 2013](https://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/244.full "The longer-term health outcomes for children born as a result of IVF treatment. Part II - Mental health and development outcomes")), so perhaps the starting point really is 100.
The thin-tail effects make the starting mean extremely important; Shulman & Bostrom say, "*Second* generation manyfold increase at right tail."
Let's consider the second generation; with their post-selection mean IQ of 109.36, what second-generation is produced in the absence of outbreeding when they use IVF selection?

~~~{.R}
eliteGain(0, (9.36/15), 1, 2, (60/15), 67996, 0, 3932181)
# [1] 1.151238772
eliteGain(0, (9.36/15), 1, 5, (60/15), 67996, 0, 3932181)
# [1] 34.98100356
~~~

Now the IVF children represent a majority. With the third generation, they reach 5x; at the fourth, 17x; at the fifth, 35x; and so on.

In practice, of course, we currently would get much less: 0.13808892057 IQ points in the USA model, which would yield a trivial percentage increase of 0.06% or 1.6%:

~~~{.R}
eliteGain(0, (0.13808892057/15), 1, 1, (60/15), 67996, 0, 3932181)
# [1] 0.0006478714323
eliteGain((15/15), (0.13808892057/15), 1, 1, (60/15), 67996, 0, 3932181)
# [1] 0.01601047464
~~~

Table 3 considers 12 scenarios: 3 adoption fractions of the general population (100% IVFer/~0.25% general population, 10%, >90%) vs 4 average gains (4, 12, 19, 100+).
The descriptions add 2 additional variables: first vs second generation, and elite vs eminent, giving 48 relevant estimates total.

colnames(scenarios) <- c("Adoption.fraction", "IQ.gain", "Generation", "Eliteness")

To help capture what might be considered important or disruptive, let's filter down the scenarios to ones where the embryo-selected now make up an absolute majority of any elite group (a fraction >0.5):

For many of the scenarios, the impact is not blatant until a second generation builds on the first, but the cumulative effect has an impact - one of the weakest scenarios, +4 IQ/10% adoption can still be seen at the second generation because easier to spot effects on the most elite levels; in another example, a boost of 12 points is noticeable in a single generation with as little as 10% of the general population adoption.
A boost of 19 points is visible in a fair number of scenarios, and a boost of 100 is visible at almost any adoption rate/generation/elite-level.
(Indeed, a boost of 100 results in almost meaninglessly large numbers under many scenarios; it's difficult to imagine a society with 100x as many geniuses running around, so it's even more difficult to imagine what it would mean for there to be 6,724x as many - other than many things will start changing extremely rapidly in unpredictable ways.)

## Cost-benefit

As written, the IVF simulator cannot deliver a cost-benefit because the costs will depend on the internal state, like how many good embryos were created or the fact that a cycle ending in no live births will still incur costs, and report the marginal gain now that we're going case by case.
So it must be augmented:

~~~{.R}
simulateIVFCB <- function (eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP=0.5, vitrificationP, liveBirth, fixedCost, embryoCost, traitValue) {
  eggsExtracted <- max(0, round(rnorm(n=1, mean=eggMean, sd=eggSD)))

  normal        <- rbinom(1, eggsExtracted, prob=normalityP)

  totalCost     <- fixedCost + normal * embryoCost
  scores        <- embryoScores(n=normal, variance=polygenicScoreVariance)

  survived      <- Filter(function(x){rbinom(1, 1, prob=vitrificationP)}, scores)

  selection <- sort(survived, decreasing=FALSE)
  live <- 0
  gain <- 0

  if (length(selection)>0) {
   for (embryo in 1:length(selection)) {
    if (rbinom(1, 1, prob=liveBirth) == 1) {
      live <- selection[embryo]
      }
   }
  gain <- max(0, live - mean(selection))
  }
  return(data.frame(Trait.SD=gain, Cost=totalCost, Net=(traitValue*gain - totalCost)))  }
library(plyr)
simulateIVFCBs <- function(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth, fixedCost, embryoCost, traitValue, iters=20000) {
  ldply(replicate(simplify=FALSE, iters, simulateIVFCB(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth, fixedCost, embryoCost, traitValue))) }
~~~

Now we have all our parameters set:

1. IQ's value per point or per SD (multiply by 15)
2. The fixed cost of selection is \$1500
3. per-embryo cost of selection is \$200
4. and the relevant probabilities have been defined already

In general, embryo selection as of January 2016 is just barely profitable or somewhat unprofitable in each group using the lowest estimate of IQ's value; it is always profitable on average with the highest estimate.

### Value of Information

To get an idea of the value of further research into improving the polygenic score or other parts of the procedure, we can look at the overall population gains in the USA if it was adopted by all potential users.

#### Public interest in selection

How many people can we expect to use embryo selection as it becomes available?

My belief is that total uptake will be fairly modest as a fraction of the population.
A large fraction of the population expresses hostility towards any new fertility-related technology whatsoever, and the people open to the possibility will be deterred by the necessity of advanced family planning, the large financial cost of IVF, and the fact that the IVF process is lengthy and painful.
I think that prospective mothers will not undergo it unless the gains are enormous: the difference between having kids or never having kids, or having a normal kid or one who will die young of a genetic disease. A fraction of an IQ point, or even a few points, is not going to cut it. (Perhaps boosts around 20 IQ points, a level with dramatic and visible effects on educational outcomes, would be enough?)

We can see this unwillingness partially expressed in long-standing trends against the wide use of sperm & egg donation. As [Matt Ridley](!Wikipedia) points out (["Why Eugenics Won't Come Back"](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/gene-editing-and-eugenics/)), a prospective mother could easily increase traits of her children by eugenic selection of sperm donors, such as eminent scientists, above and beyond the relatively unstringent screening done by current sperm banks and the selectness of sperm buyers:

> ...we now know from 40 years of experience that without coercion there is little or no demand for genetic enhancement. People generally don't want paragon babies; they want healthy ones that are like them. At the time test-tube babies were first conceived in the 1970s, many people feared in-vitro fertilization would lead to people buying sperm and eggs off celebrities, geniuses, models and athletes. In fact, the demand for such things is negligible; people wanted to use the new technology to cure infertility - to have their own babies, not other people's. It is a persistent misconception shared among clever people to assume that everybody wants clever children.

Ignoring that celebrities, models, and athletes are often highly successful sexually (which can be seen as a 'donation' of sorts), this sort of thing was in fact done by the [Repository for Germinal Choice](!Wikipedia); but despite [apparently positive results](!Wikipedia "Repository Germinal Choice#Outcomes") (as expected from selecting for highly intelligent donors), it was unpopular during its 29-year run and has no successors.

So that largely limits the market for embryo selection to those who would already use it: those who *must* use it.

Will they use it? Ridley's argument doesn't prove that they won't, because the use of sperm/egg donors comes at the cost of reducing relatedness. Non-use of "celebrities, geniuses, models, and athletes" merely shows that the perceived benefits do not outweigh the costs; it doesn't tell us what the benefits or costs are. And the cost of reducing relatedness is a severe one - a normal fertile pair of parents will no more be inclined to use a sperm or egg donor (and which one, exactly? who chooses?) than they would be to adopt.
A more relevant situation would be how parents act in the infertility situation where avoiding reduced relatedness is impossible.

In that situation, parents *are* notoriously eugenic in their preferences, demanding of sperm or egg banks that the donor be healthy, well-educated (at the Ivy League, of course, where egg donation is regularly advertised), have particular hair & eye colors (using sperm/eggs exported from Scandinavia, if necessary), be tall (men), and free of any mental illnesses.
This pervasive selection works; [Lee 2013](https://www.donorsiblingregistry.com/sites/default/files/files/dissertation%281%29.pdf "Quantitative Genetics in the Postmodern Family of the Donor Sibling Registry") draws on a donor sibling registry, documenting selection in favor of taller sperm donors, and, as predicted by the breeder's equation, offspring were taller by 1.23 inches.^["Children in the DSR were taller than the median growth curve by R = 1.23 inches, averaged across all ages for both sexes (Figure 2.3B). The selection differential, S , measures the strength of selection and is defined as the difference between the mean height of the selected parents and the mean height of the population. Biological mothers were taller than the median Caucasian female by 0.7 inches and selected donors were taller than the median Caucasian male by 2 inches, resulting in a selection differential of S = 1.35 inches (Table 2.3) (18). The response to selection is related to the selection differential by the realized heritability h^2 = R / S . Assisted reproduction created a rare natural experiment to study artificial selection for height in humans; the effect of selection as described by the realized heritability h^2 = 0 .91 was consistent with the heritability of adult height calculated using traditional methods (19)."]
Should parents discover that a sperm donor was actually autistic or schizophrenic, allegations of fraud & "[wrongful birth](!Wikipedia)" lawsuits will immediately begin flying, regardless of whether those parents would explicitly acknowledge that most human traits are highly heritable and embryo selection was possible.
The practical willingness of parents to make eugenic choices based on donor profiles suggests that advertised correctly, embryo selection could become standard.
(For example, given the pervasive Puritanical bias in health towards preventing illness instead of increasing health, embryo selection for intelligence or height can be framed as reducing the risk of developmental delays or shortness; which it would.)
Reportedly as of 2016, PGD for hair and eye color is already quietly being offered to parents and accepted, and mentions are made of the potential for selection on other traits.

Time will tell whether this becomes anything more than a exotic novelty, but it looks as though when relatedness is not a cost, parents will tend to accept it. This suggests that Ridley's argument is incorrect when extended to embryo selection/editing; people simply want to both have and eat their cake, and as embryo selection/editing entail little or no loss of relatedness, they are not comparable to sperm/egg donation.

Hence, I suggest the most appropriate target market is simply the total number of IVF users, and not the much smaller number of egg/sperm donation users.

#### VoI for USA IVF population

Using the high estimate of an average gain of \$3772, and noting that there were 67,996 IVF babies in 2013, that suggests an annual gain of up to \$256.5m.
What is the net present value of an annual gain of \$256.5m?
Discounted at 5%, it'd be \$5.256b. (Why a 5% discount rate? This is the highest discount rate I've seen used in health economics; more typical are discount rates like NICE's 3.5%, which would yield a much larger NPV.)

We might also ask: as an upper bound, in the realistic USA IVF model, how much would a perfect SNP polygenic score be worth?

Increasing the polygenic score to its maximum of 33% increases the profit by 5x. This increase, over the number of annual IVF births, gives a net present expected value of perfect information (EVPI) for a perfect score of something like \$26.3b.
How much would it cost to gain perfect information? [Hsu 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3421 "On the genetic architecture of intelligence and other quantitative traits") argues that a sample around 1 million would suffice to reach the GCTA upper bound using a particular algorithm; the largest usable^[23andMe has a much larger sample with education phenotyping, _n_>700k, but has declined to use it.] sample I know of, SSGAC, is around _n_=300k, leaving 700k to go; with SNPs costing ~\$200, that implies that it would cost \$0.14b for perfect SNP information.
Hence, the expected value of information would then be ~\$26.15b and safely profitable.
From that, we could also estimate the expected value of sample information (EVSI): if the 700k SNPs would be worth that much, then on average^[I say on average because in the Hsu 2014 simulations, the compressed-sensing algorithm exhibits an interesting 'phase transition' behavior where the accuracy of the inferences will abruptly jump past a certain sample size, rather than smoothly increase with each datapoint like most methods.] each additional datapoint is worth \$37.6k.
Aside from the Hsu 2014 estimate, we can use a formula from a model in the Rietveld et al 2013 supplementary materials (pg22-23), where they offer a population genetics-based approximation of how much variance a given sample size & heritability will explain:

1. $M = \frac{2 \cdot N_e \cdot k \cdot l}{log(2 \cdot N_e \cdot l)}$;
    they state that $N_e = 10000; k = 22; l = 1.6$, so $M = \frac{2 \cdot 10000 \cdot 22 \cdot 1.6}{log(2 \cdot 10000 \cdot 1.6)}$ or _M_ = 67865.
2. $R^2 = \frac{\frac{N}{M} \cdot h^4}{\frac{N}{M} \cdot h^2 + 1}$
    For education (the phenotype variable targeted by the main GWAS, serving as a proxy for intelligence), they estimate _h_^2^=0.2, or _h_=0.447 (h^2^ here being the heritability capturable by their SNP arrays, so equivalent to $h^2_{SNP}$), so for their sample size of 100000, they would expect to explain `N=100000; h=sqrt(0.2); ((N / 67865) * h^4) / ((N/67865) * h^2 + 1) ~> 0.045` or 4.5% of variance while they got 2-3%, suggesting over-estimation.

Using this equation we can work out changes in variance explained with changes in sample sizes, and thus the value of an additional datapoint.
For intelligence, the GCTA estimate is $h^2_{SNP} = 0.33$; Rietveld et al 2013 realized a variance explained of 0.025, implying it's equivalent to _n_=17000 when we look for a _N_ which yields 0.025 and so we need ~6x more education-phenotype samples to reach the same efficacy in predicting intelligence.
We can then ask how much variance is explained by a larger sample and how much that is worth over the annual IVF headcount.
Since selection is not profitable under the low IQ estimate and 1 more datapoint will not make it profitable, the EVSI of another education datapoint must be negative and is not worth estimating, so we use the high estimate instead, asking how much a increase of, say, 100 datapoints is worth on average:

~~~{.R}
gwasSizeToVariance <- function(N, h2) { ((N / 67865) * h2^2) / ((N/67865) * h2 + 1) }
sampleIncrease <- 1000
original     <- gwasSizeToVariance(17000, 0.33)
originalplus <- gwasSizeToVariance(17000+sampleIncrease, 0.33)
originalGain     <- mean(simulateIVFCBs(9, 4.6, original, 0.3, 0.90, 10.8/100, 1500, 200, iqHigh)$Net)
originalplusGain <- mean(simulateIVFCBs(9, 4.6, originalplus, 0.3, 0.90, 10.8/100, 1500, 200, iqHigh)$Net)
originalGain; originalplusGain
((((originalplusGain - originalGain) * ivfBirths) / log(1+discount)) / sampleIncrease) / 6
# [1] 71716.90116
~~~

\$71k is within an order of magnitude of the Hsu 2014 extrapolation, so reasonable given all the approximations here.

Going back to the lowest IQ value estimate, in the US population estimate, embryo selection only reaches break-even once the variance explained increases by a factor of 2.1 to 5.25%.
To boost it to 2.1x (0.0525) turns out to require _n_=40000 or 2.35x, suggesting that another Rietveld et al 2013-style education GWAS would be adequate once it reached  $n \geq 2.35 \cdot 101000=237350$.
After that sample size has been exceeded, EVSI will then be closer to \$10k.

## Improvements
### Limiting step: eggs or scores?

Embryo selection gains can be improved in a number of ways: harvesting more eggs, having more eggs be normal & successfully fertilized, reducing the cost of SNPing or increasing the predictive power of the polygenic scores, and better implantation success.

There's no clear way to improve egg quality or implant better, and the cost of SNPs is already dropping as fast as anyone could wish for, which leaves just improving the polygenic scores and harvesting more eggs.
Improving the polygenic scores is addressed in the previous Value of Information section and turns out to be doable and profitable but requires a large investment by institutions which may not be interested in researching the matter further.

That leaves egg harvesting; this is limited by each woman's idiosyncratic biology, and also by safety issues, and we can't expect much beyond the median 9 eggs.
There is, however, one possibility for getting many more eggs: coax stem cells into using their pluripotency to develop into eggs, possibly hundreds of viable eggs.
This method is reportedly being developed[^OvaScience] and if successful, would enable both powerful embryo selection and also be a major step towards "iterated embryo selection" (see that section).

[^OvaScience]: [_Technology Review_]("Engineering the Perfect Baby: Scientists are developing ways to edit the DNA of tomorrow's children. Should they stop before it's too late?"), 5 March 2015:

    > Scientists at several centers, including Church's, think they will soon be able to use stem cells to produce eggs and sperm in the laboratory. Unlike embryos, stem cells can be grown and multiplied. Thus they could offer a vastly improved way to create edited offspring with CRISPR. The recipe goes like this: First, edit the genes of the stem cells. Second, turn them into an egg or sperm. Third, produce an offspring. Some investors got an early view of the technique on December 17, at the Benjamin Hotel in Manhattan, during commercial presentations by OvaScience. The company, which was founded four years ago, aims to commercialize the scientific work of David Sinclair, who is based at Harvard, and Jonathan Tilly, an expert on egg stem cells and the chairman of the biology department at Northeastern University (see ["10 Emerging Technologies: Egg Stem Cells"](http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/427672/egg-stem-cells/), May/June 2012). It made the presentations as part of a successful effort to raise \$132 million in new capital during January. During the meeting, Sinclair, a velvet-voiced Australian whom Time last year named one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World," took the podium and provided Wall Street with a peek at what he called "truly world-changing" developments. People would look back at this moment in time and recognize it as a new chapter in "how humans control their bodies," he said, because it would let parents determine "when and how they have children and how healthy those children are actually going to be."
    >
    > The company has not perfected its stem-cell technology - it has not reported that the eggs it grows in the lab are viable - but Sinclair predicted that functional eggs were "a when, and not an if." Once the technology works, he said, infertile women will be able to produce hundreds of eggs, and maybe hundreds of embryos. Using DNA sequencing to analyze their genes, they could pick among them for the healthiest ones. Genetically improved children may also be possible. Sinclair told the investors that he was trying to alter the DNA of these egg stem cells using gene editing, work he later told me he was doing with Church's lab. "We think the new technologies with genome editing will allow it to be used on individuals who aren't just interested in using IVF to have children but have healthier children as well, if there is a genetic disease in their family," Sinclair told the investors. He gave the example of Huntington's disease, caused by a gene that will trigger a fatal brain condition even in someone who inherits only one copy. Sinclair said gene editing could be used to remove the lethal gene defect from an egg cell. His goal, and that of OvaScience, is to "correct those mutations before we generate your child," he said. "It's still experimental, but there is no reason to expect it won't be possible in coming years."... Tilly also said his lab was trying to edit egg stem cells with CRISPR "right now" to rid them of an inherited genetic disease that he didn't want to name. Tilly emphasized that there are "two pieces of the puzzle"-one being stem cells and the other gene editing. The ability to create large numbers of egg stem cells is critical, because only with sizable quantities can genetic changes be stably introduced using CRISPR, characterized using DNA sequencing, and carefully studied to check for mistakes before producing an egg. Tilly predicted that the whole end-to-end technology-cells to stem cells, stem cells to sperm or egg and then to offspring-would end up being worked out first in animals, such as cattle, either by his lab or by companies such as eGenesis, the spinoff from the Church lab working on livestock.

How much would getting scores or hundreds of eggs help, and how does the gain scale?
Since returns diminish, and we already know that under the low value of IQ embryo selection is not profitable, it follows that no larger number of eggs will be profitable either; so like with EVSI, we look at the high value's upper bound if we could choose an arbitrary number of eggs for free:

~~~

![Net profit vs average number of eggs](/images/iq-selection-eggcurve.png)

The maxima is ~253, yielding 0.149SD/~2.23 points & a net profit ~\$19.6k, indicating that with that many eggs, the cost of the additional SNPing exceeds the marginal IQ gain from having 1 more egg available which could turn into an embryo & be selected amongst.
With \$19.9k profit vs 253 eggs, we could say that the gain from unlimited eggs compared to the normal yield of ~9 eggs is ~\$14k (\$19k vs the best current scenario of \$4763), and that the average profit from adding each egg was \$79, giving an idea of the sort of per-egg costs one would need from an egg stem cell technology (ie small).
The total number of eggs will decrease with an increase in per-egg costs; if it costs another \$200 per embryo, then the optimal number of eggs is ~125, and so on.

So with present polygenic-scores & SNP costs, an unlimited number of eggs would only increase profit by 4x, as we are still constrained by the polygenic score.
(If, for example, we also raised the polygenic score to 33%, then with 253 eggs, we'd get 8 points & \$99k.)
This would be valuable, of course, but it is not a huge change.

### Multiple selection

A weak polygenic score can be strengthened, but it can also be combined with other polygenic scores to do selection on multiple traits, taking the maximum among the embryos' weighted sums of polygenic scores.
This can be done almost for free, since if one did sequencing on a comprehensive SNP array chip to compute 1 polygenic score, one probably has all the information needed. Indeed, you could see selection on a single trait as a multiple selection procedure where all traits' values are implausibly set to 0 except for 1 trait.
In reality, while some traits are of much more value than others, there are few traits with no value at all; an embryo which scores mediocrely on our primary trait may still have many other advantages which more than compensate, so why not check? (It is a general principle that more information is better than less.)

A quick demonstration of the possible gain is to imagine summing several normal deviates.
Working in batches of 10, we can generally get +1.53SD:

~~~{.R}
mean(replicate(100000, max(rnorm(10, mean = 0))))
#[1] 1.537378753
~~~

What if we have 4 different scores (with two downweighted substantially to reflect that they are less valuable)? We get 0.23SD for free:

~~~{.R}
mean(replicate(100000, max(   1*rnorm(10, mean = 0) +
                           0.33*rnorm(10, mean = 0) +
                           0.33*rnorm(10, mean = 0) +
                           0.33*rnorm(10, mean = 0))))
# [1] 1.769910562
~~~

The advantage of multiple polygenic scores follows from the [sum of normally-distributed independent random variables](!Wikipedia "Sum of normally distributed random variables") for 2 variables _X_ & _Y_ is $\sim N(\mu_X + \mu_Y, \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2)$; that is, the variances are added, so the standard deviation will increase, so our expected maximum sample will increase.
Recalling $E[Z] \leq \sigma \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot log(n)}$, increasing $\sigma$ beyond 1 will initially yield larger returns than increasing _n_ past 9 (it looks linear rather than square-root, but embryo selection is zero-sum - the gain is shrunk by the weighting of the multiple variables), and so multiple selection should not be neglected.

We could rewrite `simulateIVFCB` to accept as parameters a series of polygenic score functions and simulate out each polygenic score and their sums; but we could also use the sum of random variables to create a single composite polygenic score - since the variances simply sum up ($\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2$), we can take the polygenic scores, weight them, and sum them.

~~~{.R}
combineScores <- function(polygenicScores, weights) {
    weights <- weights / sum(weights) # normalize to sum to 1
    # add variances, to get variance explained of total polygenic score
    sum(weights*polygenicScores) }
~~~

Let's imagine a US example but with 3 traits now, IQ and 2 we consider to be roughly half as valuable as IQ, but which have better polygenic scores available of 60% and 5%.
What sort of gain can we expect above our starting point of \$4977?

~~~{.R}
weights <- c(1, 0.5, 0.5)
polygenicScores <- c(rietveld2013, 0.6, 0.05)
summary(simulateIVFCBs(9, 4.6, combineScores(polygenicScores, weights), 0.3, 0.90, 10.8/100, 1500, 200, iqHigh))

~~~

So we double our gains by considering 3 traits instead of 1.
A more realistic example would be to use some of the existing polygenic scores for complex traits, of which [a number are available](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/01/14/035907.full.pdf "'Contrasting the genetic architecture of 30 complex traits from summary association data', Shi et al 2016"):

1. IQ
2. height

    As previously, the best polygenic score for height predicts ~60% of variance with a population standard deviation of ~4 inches; the economics estimate is \$800 of annual income per inch or a NPV of \$16k per inch or \$65k per SD, so we would weight it as a quarter as valuable as the high IQ estimate (`((800/log(1.05))*4) / iqHigh ~> 0.27`). The causal link is not fully known, but a [Mendelian randomization study](http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i582 "'Height, body mass index, and socioeconomic status: Mendelian randomisation study in UK Biobank', Tyrrell et al 2016") of height & BMI supports causal estimates of \$300/\$1616 per SD respectively, which shows the correlations are not solely due to confounding.
3. [BMI](!Wikipedia "Body mass index")/[obesity](!Wikipedia)

    Polygenic scores: [2.7%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382211/ "'Genetic studies of body mass index yield new insights for obesity biology', Locke et al 2015")/[7.1%](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2015205a.html "'Assessing the genetic overlap between BMI and cognitive function', Marioni et al 2016")/[15.3%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973018/ "'Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 11 new loci for anthropometric traits and provides insights into genetic architecture', Berndt et al 2013"), population SD [(for men) is 4.67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3651246/ "'Population Trends and Variation in Body Mass Index from 1971 to 2008 in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort', Block et al 2013"). Cost is a little trickier (low BMI can be as bad as high BMI, lots of costs are not paid by individuals, etc) but one could say there's ["an average marginal cost of \$175 per year per adult for a 1 unit change in BMI for each adult in the U.S. population."](http://vinecon.ucdavis.edu/publications/cwe1201.pdf "'The Marginal External Cost of Obesity in the United States', Parks et al 2012") Then we'd get a weight of 7% (`((175/log(1.05))*4.67) / iqHigh ~> 0.069`).
4. [type 2 diabetes](!Wikipedia)

    [Morris et al 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442244/ "Large-scale association analysis provides insights into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes")'s [supplementary information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442244/bin/NIHMS393294-supplement-2.pdf) reports a polygenic score predicting 5.73% on liability scale.

    Diabetes is not a continuous trait like IQ/height/BMI, but generally treated as a binary disease: you either have good blood sugar control and will not go blind and suffer all the other morbidity caused by diabetes, or you don't. The underlying genetics is still highly polygenic and mostly additive, though, and in some sense one's risk is normally distributed. The liability scale threshold model is the usual model for dealing with binary variables like this: one's risk is a normal variable (which is the sum of many individual genes), and when one is unlucky enough for this risk to be enough standard deviations out past a threshold, one has the disease. The enough standard deviations is set empirically; if 1% of the population will develop schizophrenia, then one has to be +2.33SD out to develop schizophrenia, and assuming a mean risk of 0, one can then calculate the effects of an increase or decrease. For example, if some change results in decreasing one's risk score 1SD such that it would takes another 3.33SD to develop schizophrenia, then one's probability of developing schizophrenia has decreased from 1% to 0.04%, a fall of 23x (`pnorm(qnorm(0.01)) / pnorm(qnorm(0.01)-1) ~> 22.73`) and so whatever one estimated the expected loss of schizophrenia at, it has decreased 23x and the change of 1SD can be valued at that.

    Similarly for diabetes. We can estimate the NPV of not developing diabetes at as much as [\$124,600 (NPV)](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/9/2557.full); the lifetime risk of diabetes in the USA is [approaching ~40%](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=197439 "'Lifetime Risk for Diabetes Mellitus in the United States', Narayan et al 2003") and has probably exceeded it by now (implying, incidentally, that diabetes is one of the most costly diseases in the world), so the expected loss is \$49840 and developing diabetes has a threshold of 0.39SD; a decrease of 1SD gives one a third less chance of developing diabetes (`pnorm(qnorm(0.40)-1) / pnorm(qnorm(0.40)) ~> 0.26`) for a savings of \$11k (`(124600 * 0.4) - (124600 * 0.4 * 0.26) ~> 36881`); finally, \$36.8k/SD, compared with IQ, gets a weight of 15%.
5. [ADHD](!Wikipedia)

    ADHD polygenic scores range from [0.098%](http://adhdnet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hamshere-2013-High-loading-of-polygenic.pdf "'High Loading of Polygenic Risk for ADHD in Children With Comorbid Aggression', Hamshere et al 2013")/[0.4%](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856715000404 "'Shared Genetic Influences Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Traits in Children and Clinical ADHD', Stergiakouli et al 2015")/[0.5%](http://adhdnet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Groen-Blokhuis-2014-ADHD-Polygenic-risk-scores.pdf  "'Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Polygenic Risk Scores Predict Attention Problems in a Population-Based Sample of Children', Groen-Blokhuis et al 2014")/[0.59%](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/203/2/107.full "'Shared polygenic contribution between childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and adult schizophrenia', Hamshere et al 2013")/[1.5%](http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v5/n2/full/tp20155a.html "'The relative contribution of common and rare genetic variants to ADHD', Martin et al 2015").
    Prevalence rates differ based on country & diagnosis method, but most genetics studies were run using DSM diagnoses in the West, so ~7% of children affected.
    [Biederman & Faraone 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1781280/ "The Effects of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder on Employment and Household Income") find large harmful correlations, estimating a -\$8900 annual loss from ADHD or ~\$182k NPV.
    So the best score is 1.5%; the liability threshold is 1.47SD; the starting expected loss is ~\$12768; a 1SD reduction is then worth \$11.5k (`182000*pnorm(qnorm(0.07)) - 182000*pnorm(qnorm(0.07)-1) ~> 115304`) and has a weight of 4.7%.
6. [bipolar disorder](!Wikipedia)

    Scores: [1.2%](/docs/genetics/2015-power.pdf "'Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder predict creativity', Power et al 2015")/[1.4%](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naomi_Wray/publication/232772602_Common_polygenic_variation_contributes_to_risk_of_schizophrenia_and_bipolar_disorder/links/00463518a3f2ac19cb000000.pdf "'Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder', The International Schizophrenia Consortium 2009")/[2.83%]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637176/ "'Large-scale genome-wide association analysis of bipolar disorder identifies a new susceptibility locus near ODZ4', Sklar et al 2011") ([supplement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637176/bin/halms634944-supplement_1.pdf)).

    Frequency is ~3%. Ranking after schizophrenia & depression, BPD is likewise expensive, [associated with lost work, social stigma, suicide etc](/docs/2005-hirschfeld.pdf "'Bipolar Disorder—Costs and Comorbidity', Hirschfeld & Vornik 2005"). [A 1991 estimate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301427/ "'An economic evaluation of manic-depressive illness – 1991', Wyatt & Henter 1991") estimates a total annual loss of \$45 billion but doesn't give a lifetime per capita estimate; so to estimate that: in 1991, there were ~253 million people in the USA, life expectancy ~75 years, quoted 1991 lifetime prevalence of 1.3%; if there are a few million people every year with BPD which results in a total loss of \$45b in 1991 dollars, and each person lives ~75 years, then that suggests an average lifetime total loss of ~\$1026147, which [inflation-adjusted](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) to 2016 dollars is \$1784953, and this has a NPV at 5% of \$87k (`(45000000000 / (253000000 * 0.013)) * 75 ~> 1026147; 1784953 * log(1.05) ~> 87088.1499`).
    With a relatively low base-rate, the savings is not huge and it gets a weight of 0.01 (`(87088*pnorm(qnorm(0.03)) - 87088*pnorm(qnorm(0.03)-1)) / iqHigh ~> 0.01007`).

    Frequency is ~1%. Schizophrenia is even more notoriously expensive [worldwide](http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/2/279.full.pdf "'The Global Costs of Schizophrenia', Knapp et al 2004") than BPD, with 2002 USA costs estimated by [Wu et al 2005](/docs/2005-wu.pdf "The Economic Burden of Schizophrenia in the United States in 2002") at \$15464 in direct & \$22032 in indirect costs per patient, or total \$49379 in 2016 dollars for a weight of 4% (`49379 / log(1.05) ~> 1012068; (1012068*pnorm(qnorm(0.01)) - 1012068*pnorm(qnorm(0.01)-1)) ~> 9675.41; 9675/iqHigh ~> 0.039`)

The low weights suggest we won't see a 6x scaling from adding 6 more traits, but we still see a substantial gain from multiple selection - up to \$14k/2.8x better than IQ alone:

Note that this gain would be larger under lower values of IQ, as then more emphasis will be put on the other traits.
Values may also be substantially underestimated for the mental health traits because they pervasively overlap genetically (indeed, in 1 case for ADHD, the schizophrenia/bipolar polygenic scores were better predictors of ADHD status than the ADHD polygenic score was!); counterbalancing this underestimation is that the long-noted correlation between schizophrenia & creativity is turning out to also be genetic, so the gain from reduced schizophrenia/bipolar/ADHD is a tradeoff coming at some cost to creativity.

# Iterated embryo selection

Aside from regular embryo selection, Shulman & Bostrom note the possibility of "iterated embryo selection", where after the selection step, the highest-scoring embryo's cells are regressed back to stem cells, to be turned into fresh embryos which can again be sequenced & selected on, and so on for as many cycles as feasible.
The benefit here is that in exchange for the additional work, one can combine the effects of many generations of embryo selection to produce a live baby which is equivalent to selecting out of hundreds or thousands or millions of embryos.
(10 cycles is much more effective than selecting on, say, 10x the number of embryos because it acts like a ratchet: each new batch of embryos is distributed around the genetic mean of the previous iteration, not the *original* embryo, and so the 1 or 2 IQ points accumulate.)
As they summarize it:

> *Stem-cell derived gametes could produce much larger effects*: The effectiveness of embryo selection would be vastly increased if multiple generations of selection could be compressed into less than a human maturation period. This could be enabled by advances in an important complementary technology: the derivation of viable sperm and eggs from human embryonic stem cells. Such stem-cell derived gametes would enable iterated embryo selection (henceforth, IES):
>
> 1. Genotype and select a number of embryos that are higher in desired genetic characteristics;
> 2. Extract stem cells from those embryos and convert them to sperm and ova, maturing within 6 months or less ([Sparrow, 2013](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.674.771&rep=rep1&type=pdf "In vitro eugenics"));
> 3. Cross the new sperm and ova to produce embryos;
> 4. Repeat until large genetic changes have been accumulated.
>
> Iterated embryo selection has recently drawn attention from bioethics (Sparrow, 2013; see also Miller, 2012; Machine Intelligence Research Institute, 2009 [and [Suter 2015](https://jlb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/16/jlb.lsv057.full "In vitro gametogenesis: just another way to have a baby?")]) in light of rapid scientific progress. Since the [Hinxton Group (2008)](http://www.hinxtongroup.org/Consensus_HG08_FINAL.pdf "Consensus Statement: Science Ethics and Policy Challenges of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Gametes") predicted that human stem cell-derived gametes would be available within ten years, the techniques have been used to produce fertile offspring in mice, and gamete-like cells in humans. However, substantial scientific challenges remain in translating animal results to humans, and in avoiding epigenetic abnormalities in the stem cell lines. These challenges might delay human application "10 or even 50 years in the future" ([Cyranoski, 2013](http://fatstemserbia.brinkster.net/Library/Newspapers/Egg%20Engineers.pdf "Stem cells: Egg engineers")). Limitations on research in human embryos may lead to IES achieving major applications in commercial animal breeding before human reproduction. If IES becomes feasible, it would radically change the cost and effectiveness of enhancement through selection. After the fixed investment of IES, many embryos could be produced from the final generation, so that they could be provided to parents at low cost.

IES probably will work, the concept is extremely promising, and progress is still being made on it (eg [Irie et al 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414015839 "SOX17 Is a Critical Specifier of Human Primordial Germ Cell Fate"), [Zhou et al 2016](http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909%2816%2900018-7 "Complete Meiosis from Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Germ Cells In Vitro"), [Zhang et al 2016](/docs/genetics/2016-zhang.pdf "MLL1 Inhibition Reprograms Epiblast Stem Cells to Naive Pluripotency") ), but it suffers from two main problems as far as a cost-benefit evaluation goes:

1. application to human cells remains largely hypothetical, and it is difficult for any outsider to understand how effective current induced pluripotency methods for pluripotent stem cell-derived gametes are: how much will the mouse research transfer to human cells? How reliable is the induction? What might be the long-term effects - or in the case of iterating it, what may be the short-term effects? Is this 5 years or 20 years away from practicality? What does the process cost at the moment, and what sort of lower limit on materials & labor costs can we expect from a mature process?
2. IES, considered as an extension to per-individual embryo selection like above, suffers from the same weaknesses: Presumably the additional steps of inducing pluripotency and re-fertilizing will be complicated & very expensive (especially given that the proposed timelines for a single cycle run 4-6 *months*) compared to a routine sequencing & implantation, and this makes the costs explode: if the iteration costs \$10k extra per cycle and each cycle of embryo selection is only gaining ~1.13 IQ points due to the inherent weakness of polygenic scores, then each cycle may well be a loss, and the entire process colossally expensive. The ability to create large numbers of eggs from stem cells would boost the _n_ but that still runs into diminishing returns and as shown above, does not drastically change matters. (If one is already spending \$10k on IVF and the SNP sequencing for each embryo costs \$100 then to get a respectable amount like 1 standard deviation through IES requires `(15/1.13) * (100+10000) + 10000 ~> 144070.7965`, which at almost \$9k a point is far beyond the ability to pay of almost everyone except multi-millionaires or governments who may have other reasons justifying use of the process.)

So it's difficult to see when IES will ever be practical or cost-effective as a simple drop-in replacement for embryo selection.

The real value of IES is as a radically different paradigm than embryo selection.
Instead of selecting on a few embryos, done separately for each set of parents, IES would instead be a total replacement for the sperm/egg donation industry.
This is what Shulman & Bostrom mean by that final line about "fixed investment": a single IES program doing selection through dozens of generations might be colossally expensive compared to a single round of embryo selection, but the cost of creating that final generation of enhanced stem cells can then be amortized indefinitely by creating sperm & egg cells and giving them to all parents who need sperm or egg donations. (If it costs \$100m and is amortized over only 52k IVF births in the first year, then it costs a mere \$2k for what could be gains of many standard deviations on many traits.)
The offspring may only be related to one of the parents, but that has proven to be acceptable to many couples in the past opting for egg/sperm donation or adoption; and the expected genetic gain will also be halved, but half of a large gain may still be very large.
Sparrow et al 2013 points towards further refinements based on agricultural practices: since we are not expecting the final stem cells to be related to the parents using them for eggs/sperms, we can start with a seed population of stem cells which is maximally diverse and contains as many rare variants as possible, and do multiple selection on it for many generations.
(We can even [cross IES with other approaches like CRISPR gene editing](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/543541/how-to-really-engineer-a-human-baby/ "How to (Really) Engineer a Human Baby: A global meeting in Washington, D.C., isn’t just about whether or not we should alter our species with CRISPR. It’s about how we can pull it off."): CRISPR can be used to target known causal variants to speed things up, or be used to repair any mutations arising from the long culturing or selection process.)

We can say that while IES still looks years away and is not possible or cost-effective at the moment, it definitely has the potential to be a game-changer, and a close eye should be kept on in vitro gametogenesis-related research.

## Limits to iterated selection

One might wonder: how many generations of selection could IES do now, considering that the polygenic scores explore 'only' a few percent of variance and we've already seen that in 1 step of selection we get a small amount?
Is it possible that after 2 or 3 rounds of selection, the polygenic score will peter out and one will 'run out' of variance?

No. We can observe that in animal and plant breeding, it is almost never the case that selection on a complex trait gives increases for a few generation and then stops cold - unless it's a simple trait governed by one or two genes, in which case they might've been driven to fixation that fast.
The more genes involved, the longer selection can operate and the more potential there is.

It's true that a polygenic score might be able to predict only a small fraction of variance, but this is in part because of the Central Limit Theorem: with thousands of genes with additive effects, they sum up to a tight bell curve, and it's 5001 steps forward, 4999 steps backwards, which gives little hint as to what would happen if we could take all 10000 steps forward.
So the total potential gain has more to do with the heritability vs number of alleles, which makes sense - if a trait is mostly caused by a single gene which half the population already has, we would not expect to be able to make much difference; but if it's mostly caused by a few dozen genes, then few people will have the maximal value; and if by a few hundred or a few thousand, then probably no one will have ever had the maximal value and the gain could be enormous.
Consider a simple binomial model of 10000 alleles with 1/0 unit weights at 50% frequency, explaining 80% of variance; the mean sum will be `10000*0.5=5000` with an SD of `sqrt(10000*0.5*0.5)=50`; if we observe a population IQ SD of 15, and each +SD is due 80% to having +50 beneficial variants, then each allele is worth ~0.26 points, and then, regardless of any 'polygenic score' we might've constructed explaining a few percent of the 10000 alleles' influence, the maximal gain over the average person is `0.26*(10000-5000)=1300` points/86SDs.
A more realistic model with exponentially distributed weights gives a similar estimate[^Benyamin-exponential]

[^Benyamin-exponential]: Taking the binomial model from before, we replace the 1/0 unit weights with weights which are 0 or are drawn from an exponential distribution.
    A fit to the Benyamin et al 2014 betas gives an [exponential distribution](!Wikipedia) with a rate/λ=1063 or since the betas were in SDs, λ=71. We can then simulate the consequences of going from 5000 0 alleles & 5000 positive alleles to all 10000 positive alleles:

    ~~~{.R}
    mean(replicate(1000, sum(sample(rexp(10000, rate=71), 5000))))
    # [1] 70.41815521
    sd(  replicate(1000, sum(sample(rexp(10000, rate=71), 5000))))
    # [1] 0.9788748364

    mean(replicate(1000, sum(sample(rexp(10000, rate=71), 10000))))
    # [1] 140.8316512
    sd(  replicate(1000, sum(sample(rexp(10000, rate=71), 10000))))
    # [1] 1.42341606

    (140.8316512 - 70.41815521) / 0.9788748364
    # [1] 71.93309438

    gains <- function (n) { upper <- n; lower <- upper*0.5; rate <- 70;
                            (upper*rate^-1 - lower*rate^-1) / sqrt(lower * (rate^-1)^2) }
    plot(sapply(seq(1, 100000, by=10), gains))
    ~~~

    Another way would be to calculate it: on average, one will have half the possible 10000 variants; the sum of _k_=5000 exponential variates of λ=71 is $\text{Gamma}(5000, 71^{-1})$, and the mean of that [gamma distribution](!Wikipedia) is $5000 \cdot 71^{-1}=70.4$ with a SD of $\sqrt{5000 \cdot ((71^{-1})^2)} = 0.99$; while the upper bound with all 10000 is 140.8(1.4) respectively.
    So if existing genetic variation, leading to the differences in intelligence we can observe, represents the contribution of a genetic SD 0.99 on an absolute scale, then the possible increase going from ~5000 good variants to all 10000 variants represents an increase of $\frac{140.8 - 70.4}{0.99}= 71.1$ genetic SDs, which after weakening by a heritability of 80% is still large and fairly similar to the binomial result.


We could also ask what the upper limit is by looking at an existing polygenic score and seeing what it would predict for a hypothetical individual who had the better version of each one.
The Rietveld et al 2013 polygenic score for education-years is available and can be adjusted into intelligence, but for clarity I'll use the [Benyamin et al 2014 polygenic score on intelligence](http://ssgac.org/documents/CHIC_Summary_Benyamin2014.txt.gz) ([codebook](http://ssgac.org/documents/CHIC_Benyamin2014_Summary_Notes.pdf)):

Many of these estimates come with large _p_-values reflecting the relatively large standard error compared to the unbiased MLE estimate of its average additive effect on IQ points, and are definitely not genome-wide statistically-significant.
Does this mean we cannot use them? Of course not!
From a Bayesian perspective, many of these SNPs have high posterior probabilities; from a predictive perspective, even the tiny effects are gold because there are so many of them; from a decision perspective, the expected value is still non-zero as on average each will have its predicted effect - selecting on all the 0.05 variants will increase by that many 0.05s etc. (It's at the extremes that the MLE estimate is biased.)

We can see that over a million have non-zero point-estimates and that the overall distribution of effects looks roughly exponentially distributed.
The Benyamin SNP data includes all the SNPs which passed quality-checking, but is not identical to the polygenic score used in the paper as that removed SNPs which were in linkage disequilibrium; leaving such SNPs in leads to double-counting of effects (two SNPs in LD may reflect just 1 SNP's causal effect).
I took the top 1000 SNPs and used [SNAP](https://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearchpw.php) to get a list of SNPs with an r^2^>0.2 & within 250-KB, which yielded ~1800 correlated SNPs, suggesting that a full pruning would leave around a third of the SNPs, which we can mimic by selecting a third at random.

The sum of effects (corresponding to our imagined population which has been selected on for so many generations that the polygenic score no longer varies because everyone has all the maximal variants) is the thoroughly absurd estimate of +6k SD over all SNPs and +5.6k SD filtering down to _p_<0.5 and +3k adjusting for existing frequencies (going from minimum to maximum); halving for symmetry, that is still thousands of possible SDs:

![The betas/effect-sizes of the Benyamin et al 2014 polygenic score for intelligence, illustrating the many thousands of variants available for selection on.](/images/iq-selection-benyamin2014-polygenicscore-betas.png)

Thousands of SDs is meaningless, since intelligence reflects neurobiological traits like nerve conduction velocity, brain size, white matter integrity, metabolic demands etc, all of which must have inherent biological limits (although considerations from the scaling of the primate brain architecture suggest that the human brain could be increased substantially, similar to the increase from Australopithecus to humans, before gains disappear; see [Hofman 2015](/docs/iq/2015-hofman.pdf "Evolution of the Human Brain: From Matter to Mind")); so while it's reasonable to talk about boosting to 5-10SDs based on additive variants, beyond that there's no reason to expect additivity to hold.
Since the polygenic score only becomes uninformative thousands of SDs beyond where other issues will take over, we can safely say that the polygenic scores will not 'run dry' during an IES project, much less normal embryo selection - additivity will run out before the polygenic score's information does.
