# Embryo selection cost-effectiveness

[In vitro fertilization](!Wikipedia) (IVF) is a medical procedure for infertile women in which eggs are extracted, fertilized with sperm, allowed to develop into an embryo, and the embryo injected into their womb to induce pregnancy.
The choice of embryo is relatively random, with the best looking one implanted; various tests can be run on embryos, including genome sequencing, by extracting a few cells from the embryo.
[Preimplantation genetic profiling / preimplantation genetic diagnosis / preimplantation genetic screening](!Wikipedia "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis") (PGD) is when genetic information is taken and used to choose which embryo to implant.
Currently, embryos are screened for gross abnormalities like the wrong number of chromosomes which would either be fatal to the embryo's development or cause birth defects like Down's (so there is no point in implanting it rather than a healthier embryo).
But with ever cheaper SNP arrays, large amounts of subtler genetic information becomes available, and one could check for abnormalities and also start making predictions about adult phenotypes, and one could choose embryos with higher/lower probability of traits with many known genetic hits such as height or intelligence or alcoholism or schizophrenia - thus, in effect, creating ["designer babies"](!Wikipedia "Designer baby#Preimplantation genetic diagnosis") with proven technology no more exotic than IVF and 23andMe.

In ["Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game‐changer?"](https://intelligence.org/files/EmbryoSelection.pdf), Shulman & Bostrom 2014 consider the potential of embryo selection for greater intelligence in a little detail, ultimately concluding that in the most applicable current scenario of minimal uptake (restricted largely to those forced into IVF use) and gains of a few IQ points, embryo selection is more of "curiosity" than "game-changer" as it will be "Socially negligible over one generation. Effects of social controversy more important than direct impacts."

Some things are left out of their analysis which I'm interested in:

1. they give the upper bound on the IQ gain that can be expected from a given level of selection, but not the gain that could be expected right now: is it a large or small fraction of that maximum?
2. their level of selection may bear little resemblance to what can be practically obtained given the realities of IVF and high embryo attrition rates (selecting from 1 in 10 embryos may yield _x_ IQ points, but how many real embryos would we need to implement that, since if we extract 10 embryos, 3 might be abnormal, the best candidate might fail to implant, the second-best might result in a miscarriage, etc?)
3. there is no attempt to estimate costs nor whether embryo selection right now is worth the costs or how much better our selection ability would need to be to make it worthwhile

## Value of IQ

Shulman & Bostrom 2014 note that

> Studies in labor economics typically find that one IQ point corresponds to an increase in wages on the order of 1 per cent, other things equal, though higher estimates are obtained when effects of IQ on educational attainment are included (Zax and Rees, 2002; Neal and Johnson, 1996; Cawley et al., 1997; Behrman et al., 2004; Bowles et al., 2002; Grosse et al., 2002).^2^ The individual increase in earnings from a genetic intervention can be assessed in the same fashion as prenatal care and similar environmental interventions. One study of efforts to avert low birth weight estimated the value of a 1 per cent increase in earnings for a newborn in the US to be between \$2,783 and \$13,744, depending on discount rate and future wage growth (Brooks-Gunn et al., 2009)

Estimating the value of an additional IQ point is difficult as there are many perspectives one could take: zero-sum, including only personal earnings or wealth and neglecting all the wealthy produced for society (eg through research), often based on correlating income with intelligence scores or education; positive-sum, attempting to include the positive externalities, perhaps through cross or longitudinal global comparisons, as intelligence predicts later wealth and the wealth of a country is closely linked to the average intelligence of its population which captures many (but not all) of the positive externalities; measures which include the greater longevity & happiness of more intelligent people, etc.
Further, intelligence has intrinsic value of its own, and the genetic hits appear to be pleiotropic and improve other desirable traits; the intelligence/longevity correlation has been found to be due to common genetics, and
[Krapohl et al 2015](http://www.hungrymindlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Krapohl-et-al-2015.pdf "Phenome-wide analysis of genome-wide polygenic scores") examines the correlation of polygenic scores with 50 diverse traits, finding that the college/IQ polygenic scores correlate with 10+ of them in generally desirable directions[^Krapohl-phenome], similar to [Hagenaars et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2015225a.html "Shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and physical and mental health in UK Biobank (N=112 151) and 24 GWAS consortia")[^Hagenaars-phenome], indicating both causation for those correlations & benefits beyond income.
There are also pitfalls, like the fallacy of controlling for an intermediate variable, exemplified by studies which attempt to correlate intelligence with income after "controlling for" education, despite knowing that educational attainment is caused *by* intelligence and so their estimates are actually something irrelevant like 'the gain from greater intelligence for reasons other than through its effect on education'.
Estimates have come from a variety of sources, such as iodine and lead studies.
Given the difficulty of coming up with any estimate for 'the' value of an IQ point, I will just reuse the \$2783-13744 range.

[^Krapohl-phenome]: More specifically, combining the College/Adult IQ/Child IQ polygenic scores and including the non-statistically-significant ones, I get out of Figure 1 :

    1. Better: _g_ / Raven's Progressive Matrices / Mill Hill Vocabulary / GCSE English / GCSE maths / GCSE science / PISA Attitudes to School / PISA homework Behaviour / PISA maths self-efficacy / PISA maths interest / PISA time spent on maths / Academic self-concept / Agreeableness / Conscientiousness / Extraversion / Neuroticism / Openness / Curiosity Flow / Chaos at Home / Attachment total / SDQ Total ([Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire](!Wikipedia); behavioral problems) / SDQ Conduct / SDQ Hyperactivity / SDQ Prosocial / Peer Victimization / Conners: Inattention / Conners: Impulsivity / Autism Quotient: Attention Switching / Autism Quotient: Imagination / Autism Quotient: Attention to Detail / Callous Unemotional Traits / ARBQ Anxiety / SANS (negative symptoms) / Grandiosity / Cognitive Disorganization / BMI / Height
    2. Neutral: PISA Homework total / Menarche / Puberty
    3. Worse: PISA Homework Feedback [?] / PISA time spent on maths [?] / GRIT / Curiosity Flow / Parental Control / Autism Quotient: Attention Switching / Grandiosity / Paranoid / Sleep total / Insomnia

    (In a few cases it's not clear how to interpret. Is less time on math a good or bad thing since the PISA & GCSE math scores are still higher?)
[^Hagenaars-phenome]: Hagenaars focused more on medical & psychiatric issues; breaking it down similarly across the 4 measures of cognitive functioning:

    1. better: Stroke: Cardioembolic / ADHD / Major depressive disorder / Blood pressure: diastolic / Blood pressure: systolic
    2. Mixed: Coronary artery disease / Stroke: ischaemic / Stroke: large vessel disease / Type 2 diabetes / Alzheimer's disease / Autism / Bipolar disorder / Schizophrenia / Hippocampal volume / Intracranial volume / Infant head circumference / BMI / Height / Longevity / FEV1
    3. Worse: none

## Polygenic scores for IQ
### SNP

Shulman & Bostrom's upper bound works as follows:

> Standard practice today involves the creation of fewer than ten embryos. Selection among greater numbers than that would require multiple IVF cycles, which is expensive and burdensome. Therefore 1-in-10 selection may represent an upper limit of what would currently be practically feasible ...The standard deviation of IQ in the population is about 15. [Davies et al. (2011)](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/full/mp201185a.html "Genome-wide association studies establish that human intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic") estimates that common additive variation can account for half of variance in adult fluid intelligence in its sample. Siblings share half their genetic material on average. Thus, in a crude estimate, variance is cut by 75 per cent and standard deviation by 50 per cent. Adjustments for assortative mating, deviation from the Gaussian distribution, and other factors would adjust this estimate, but not drastically. These figures were generated by simulating 10 million couples producing the listed number of embryos and selecting the one with the highest predicted IQ based on the additive variation.
>
> Table 1. How the maximum amount of IQ gain (assuming a Gaussian distribution of predicted IQs among the embryos with a standard deviation of 7.5 points) might depend on the number of embryos used in selection:
>
> Selection    Average IQ gain
> ----------   ---------------
> 1 in 2       4.2
> 1 in 10      11.5
> 1 in 100     18.8
> 1 in 1000    24.3

That is, adult intelligence is heritable at ~0.8; a SNP chip records the few hundred thousand most common genetic variants in the population and treating each gene as having a simple additive increase-or-decrease effect on intelligence, Davies et al 2011's GCTA (Genome-wide complex trait analysis) estimates that those SNPs are responsible for 0.51 of variance; since siblings descend from the same two parents, they will share half the variants (just like dizygotic twins) and differ on the rest, so the SNPs can only predict up to 0.25 between siblings and siblings are analogous to multiple embryos being considered for implantation in IVF; simulate _n_ embryos by drawing from a normal distribution with a SD of 0.7 or 10.5 IQ points and selecting the highest, and with various _n_, you get something like the table.

GCTA tells us how much the SNPs would explain if we knew all their effects exactly, but in practice, there are so many SNPs (likely into the thousands) affecting intelligence, only a few are known to a high level of confidence, and the rest will take much larger samples to pin down, so the table represents an upper limit to SNP-based approaches - to approach the 0.51, we will need large sample sizes, and to exceed it and approach the 0.8, we will need whole genomes and models which can go beyond additive estimates to model interactions (like genes which only increase intelligence in the presence of particular other variants).

Davies et al 2011's 0.5 is a little outdated and small, based on _n_=3511 with correspondingly large imprecision in the GCTA estimates. More recent papers:

    0.174 (but on the liability scale for extremely high intelligence, so unclear relevance)

The earlier estimates tend to be smaller samples and higher, and I put more trust in the later ones which are estimating closer to 1/3, which reduces the potential of embryo selection.
Since half of additives will be shared within family, then we get `0.33*0.5 = 0.165` within-family variance, which gives `sqrt(0.165) = 0.4062019202` SD or 6.1 IQ points
(Occasionally within-family differences are cited in a format like "siblings have an average difference of 12 IQ points", which comes from an SD of ~0.7/0.8, since `0.8*15=12`, but you could also check what SD yields an average difference of 12 via simulation: eg `mean(abs(rnorm(n=10000000, mean=0, sd=0.71) - rnorm(n=10000000, mean=0, sd=0.71))) * 15 ~> 12.01807542`.)
We don't care about means since we're only looking at gains, so the mean of the within-family normal distribution can be set to 0.

With that, we can write a simulation like Bostrom & Shulman where we generate _n_ samples from N(0, 6.1), take the max, and return the difference of the max and mean:

~~~{.R}
## select 1 out of N siblings
embryoIQScores <- function(n, variance) { rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=sqrt(variance*0.5)*15); }
embryoSelectionGain <- function(n, variance) { scores <- embryoIQScores(n, sqrt(variance*0.5)*15); return(max(scores) - mean(scores)); }
simEmbryoSelection <- function(n=2, variance=0.33, iters=100000) { replicate(iters, embryoSelection(n, variance)); }
mean(simEmbryoSelection(10))
# [1] 9.368836794
~~~

So 1 out of 10 gives a maximal average gain of ~9 IQ points, less than 11.5 because of the lower GCTA estimates.

A SNP-based polygenic score works much the same way: it explains a certain fraction or percentage of the variance, halved due to siblings, and can be plugged in once we know how much less than 0.33 it is.
An example of using SNP polygenic scores to identify genetic influences and verify they work within-family and are not confounded would be Domingue et al 2015's ["Polygenic Influence on Educational Attainment"](http://ero.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2332858415599972?full).
Past polygenic scores for intelligence:

    0.5776% of fluid intelligence in the NCNG replication sample, if I've understood their analysis correctly.
2. ["GWAS of 126,559 Individuals Identifies Genetic Variants Associated with Educational Attainment"](/docs/iq/2013-rietveld.pdf), Rietveld et al 2013:

    This landmark study providing the first GWAS hits on intelligence also estimated multiple polygenic scores: the full polygenic scores predicted 2.5% of variance in cognitive function in a Swedish replication sample, and also performed well in within-family settings (0.31% & 0.19% of variance in attending college & years of education, respectively, in [Table S25](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2013/05/29/science.1235488.DC1/Rietveld.SM.revision.2.pdf)).

    Supplementary Table 4d reports predictive validity of the educational attainment polygenic score for childhood-cognitive-ability/college-degree/years-of-education in its other samples, yielding R^2^=0.0042/0.0214/0.0223 or 0.42%/2.14%/2.23% respectively. Particularly intriguing given its investigation of pleiotropy is Supplementary Table 5, which uses polygenic scores constructed for all the diseases in its data (eg type 2 diabetes, ADHD, schizophrenia, coronary artery disease), where all the disease scores & covariates are entered into the model and then the cognitive polygenic scores are able to predict even higher, as high as R^2^=0.063/0.046/0.064.

Davies also reports the polygenic score, accounting for 1.2% or 0.012 of all variance. (This is much higher than Rietveld et al 2013's 0.3%.) Same procedure to estimate value of embryo selection: halve to account for siblings' shared genetics then simulate:
`0.012 * 0.5 = 0.006`; `sqrt(0.006) = 0.07745966692` SD or 1.162 IQ points

## Cost of polygenic scores

PGD is currently [legal everywhere in the USA](!Wikipedia "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis#United States"), so there are no criminal or legal costs; even if there were, clinics in other countries will continue to offer it, and the cost of using a Chinese fertility clinic may not be particularly noticeable.[^China-trip]

[^China-trip]: We could consider a hypothetical trip to China to make use of fertility clinics there. How much additional would one pay?

    Costs:

    - US passport costs ~\$110
    - a Chinese visa costs [\$140](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/visas/fees/t1236036.htm)
    - a Shanghai to San Francisco roundtrip flight prices out currently in the range \$500-\$1000 (lower than I expected, perhaps due to the 2015 oil glut)
    - IVF is a long and involved process, so one should budget for at least 3 months residence: [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/money-costs) thinks that on a shoestring budget one can manage >\$30/day, so `3*31*30=$2790`.
    - IVF is also unpleasant enough that it would be wrong to consider those 3 months a vacation and one has to consider the impact of being away from one's job for such an extended period of time (as remote working is not an option for most people & the Great Firewall would impede that as well); so since 2013 US per capita income was \$53.8, those 3 months would cost on average somewhere <\$13.4k
    - Summing up: `110+140+2790+13400=$16.4k`.

    On the plus side:

    - Chinese IVF fertility clinics are presumably cheaper as well as more willing to do PGD. A [2011 NPR article](http://www.npr.org/2011/07/01/137530286/in-china-an-ivf-clinic-grapples-with-huge-demand) quotes a Chinese fertility clinic as offering 1 cycle at \$4.5k, which is around half of what a US clinic might charge; so the total penalty of going to China will depend on how many cycles are necessary. If 1 cycle, then it's \$10k vs \$16k+\$4.5k, a loss of -\$10.5k; for 2, -\$5k; for 3, +\$0.5k; and for 4, +\$6k, and so on.

        IVF cycle success rates being <41% and following a negative binomial, we can say that 2 or more cycles will be required, more often than not, and often 3 or 4, to get 1 live birth (after which it stops); one issue is that if a woman leaves as soon as pregnancy is confirmed with a fetal heartbeat, there may still be a miscarriage and they would have to decide whether to fly back to China and start another cycle, while if they stay for the full pregnancy, that triples food/hotel costs.

    So overall, I think we can say that on average, doing IVF in China is not as financially costly as it seems up front and could even be profitable. Which leaves the more psychological issues of trust and planning and willingness to go overseas, which are hard to evaluate in the absence of any present incentive to do Chinese genetic-engineering birth tourism, but [medical tourism](!Wikipedia) and [birth tourism](!Wikipedia) are both already phenomena.

cost of SNPing?

http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/services/pricing.pdf NIH CIDR says full cost: $150-$210 for 1 use of a UK Biobank 821K [SNP] Axiom Array [capabilities](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UK-Biobank-Axiom-Array-Content-Summary-2014.pdf) as of 10 December 2015

probably want to use a full SNP array;

- cost: need a custom chip to select the top 100 or whatever; NIH CIDR wants $40 for 96 SNPs! So almost $0.5/SNP, versus $0.0001/SNP for the Biobank Array
- predictive power of top 10 or 100 SNPs is much smaller than polygenic score due to massive polygenicity: rather than 1.2%, maybe 0.1%?

    - in addition, the top SNPs are imprecisely estimated

["Clinical outcome of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening using next generation sequencing"](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/pdf/2047-217X-3-30.pdf), Tan et al December 2014:

> A total of 395 couples participated. They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age. A total of 1,512 blastocysts were biopsied on D5 after fertilization, with 1,058 blastocysts set aside for SNP array testing and 454 blastocysts for NGS testing. In the NGS cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 52.6% (60/114), 61.3% (49/80) and 14.3% (7/49), respectively. In the SNP array cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 47.6% (139/292), 56.7% (115/203) and 14.8% (17/115), respectively. The outcome measures of both the NGS and SNP array cycles were the same with insignificant differences. There were 150 blastocysts that underwent both NGS and SNP array analysis, of which seven blastocysts were found with inconsistent signals. All other signals obtained from NGS analysis were confirmed to be accurate by validation with qPCR. The relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for each blastocyst that underwent NGS testing was evaluated, and a significant difference was found between the copy number of mtDNA for the euploid and the chromosomally abnormal blastocysts. So far, out of 42 ongoing pregnancies, 24 babies were born in NGS cycles; all of these babies are healthy and free of any developmental problems.
>
> ...The median number of normal/ balanced embryos per couple was 1.76 (range from 0 to 8).
>
> ...Among the 129 couples in the NGS cycles group, 33 couples had no euploid embryos suitable for transfer; 75 couples underwent embryo transfer and the remaining 21 couples are currently still waiting for transfer. In the SNP array cycles group, 177 couples underwent embryo transfer, 66 couples had no suitable embryos for transfer, and 23 couples are currently still waiting. Of the 666 normal/balanced blastocysts, 421 blastocysts were warmed after vitrification, 406 survived (96.4% of survival rate) and were transferred in 283 cycles. The numbers of blastocysts transferred per cycle were 1.425 (114/80) and 1.438 (292/203) for NGS and SNP array, respectively. The proportion of transferred embryos that successfully implanted was evaluated by ultrasound 6–7 weeks after embryo transfer, indicating that 60 and 139 embryos resulted in a fetal sac, giving implantation rates of 52.6% (60/114) and 47.6% (139/292) for NGS and SNP array, respectively. Prenatal diagnosis with karyotyping of amniocentesis fluid samples did not find any fetus with chromosomal abnormalities. A total of 164 pregnancies were detected, with 129 singletons and 35 twins. The clinical pregnancy rate per transfer cycle was 61.3% (49/80) and 56.7% (115/203) for NGS and SNP array, respectively (Table 3). A total of 24 miscarriages were detected, giving rates of 14.3% (7/49) and 14.8% (17/115) in NGS and SNP array cycles, respectively

> ...The ongoing pregnancy rates were 52.5% (42/80) and 48.3% (98/203) in NGS and SNP array cycles, respectively. Out of these pregnancies, 24 babies were delivered in 20 NGS cycles; so far, all the babies are healthy and chromosomally normal according to karyotype analysis. In the SNP array cycles group the outcome of all pregnancies went to full term and 75 healthy babies were delivered (Table 3).

> ...NGS is with a bright prospect. A case report described the use of NGS for PGD recently [33]. Several comments for the application of NGS/MPS in PGD/PGS were published [34,35]. The cost and time of sequencing is already competitive with array tests, and the estimated reagent cost of sequencing for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities is currently less than $100.

395 women, 1512 eggs successfully extracted & fertilized into blastocysts (~3.8 per woman); after genetic testing, 256+590=846 or 55% were abnormal & could not be used, leaving 666 good ones; all were vitrified for storage during analysis and 421 of the normal ones rethawed, leaving 406 useful survivors or ~1.4 per woman; the 406 were implanted into 252 women, yielding 24+75=99 healthy live births or 24% implanted-embryo->birth rate.

> Probabilities for clinical outcomes with IVF and PGS in RPL patients were obtained from a 2012 study by Hodes-Wertz et al. (10). This is the single largest study to date of outcomes using 24-chromosome screening by array comparative genomic hybridization in a well-defined RPL population...The Hodes-Wertz study reported on outcomes of 287 cycles of IVF with 24-chromosome PGS with a total of 2,282 embryos followed by fresh day-5 embryo transfer in RPL patients. Of the PGS cycles, 67% were biopsied on day 3, and 33% were biopsied on day 5. The average maternal age was 36.7 years (range: 21–45 years), and the mean number of prior miscarriages was 3.3 (range: 2–7). From 287 PGS cycles, 181 cycles had at least one euploid embryo and proceeded to fresh embryo transfer. There were 52 cycles with no euploid embryos for transfer, four cycles where an embryo transfer had not taken place at the time of analysis, and 51 cycles that were lost to follow-up observation. All patients with a euploid embryo proceeded to embryo transfer, with an average of 1.65 Æ 0.65 (range: 1–4) embryos per transfer. Excluding the cycles lost to follow-up evaluation and the cycles without a transfer at the time of analysis, the clinical pregnancy rate per attempt was 44% (n 1⁄4 102). One attempt at conception was defined as an IVF cycle and oocyte retrieval Æ embryo transfer. The live-birth rate per attempt was 40% (n1⁄4 94), and the miscarriage rate per pregnancy was 7% (n 1⁄4 7). Of these seven miscarriages, 57% (n 1⁄4 4) occurred after detection of fetal cardiac activity (10). Information on the percent- age of cycles with surplus embryos was not provided in the Hodes-Wertz study, so we drew from their database of 240 RPL patients with 118 attempts at IVF and PGS (12). The clinical pregnancy, live-birth, and clinical miscarriage rates did not statistically significantly differ between the outcomes published in the Hodes-Wertz study (P1⁄4 .89, P1⁄4 .66, P1⁄4 .61, respectively). We reported that 62% of IVF cycles had at least one surplus embryo (12).
>
> ...The average cost of preconception counseling and baseline RPL workup, including parental karyotyping, maternal antiphospholipid antibody testing, and uterine cavity evaluation, was $4,377 (range: $4,000–$5,000) (16). Because this was incurred by both groups before their entry into the decision tree, it was not included as a cost input in the study. The average cost of IVF was $18,227 (range: $6,920–$27,685) (16) and includes cycle medications, oocyte retrieval, and one embryo transfer. The average cost of PGS was $4,268 (range $3,155–$12,626) (17), and the average cost of a frozen embryo transfer was $6,395 (range: $3,155–$12,626) (13, 16). The average cost of managing a clinical miscarriage with dilation and curettage (D&C) was $1,304 (range: $517–$2,058) (18). Costs incurred in the IVF–PGS strategy include the cost of IVF, PGS, fresh embryo transfer, frozen embryo transfer, and D&C. Costs incurred in the expectant management strategy include only the cost of D&C.

> The number of diseases currently diagnosed via PGD-PCR is approximately 200 and includes some forms of inherited cancers such as retinoblastoma and the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA2). 52 PGD has also been used in new applications such as HLA matching. 53,54 The ESHRE PGD consortium data analysis of the past 10 years’ experience demonstrated a clinical pregnancy rate of 22% per oocyte retrieval and 29% per embryo transfer. 55 Table 4 shows a sample of the different monogenetic diseases for which PGD was carried out between January and December 2009, according to the ESHRE data. 22 In these reports a total of 6160 cycles of IVF cycles with PGD or PGS, including PGS-SS, are presented. Of these, 2580 (41.8%) were carried out for PGD purposes, in which 1597 cycles were performed for single-gene disorders, including HLA typing. An additional 3551 (57.6%) cycles were carried out for PGS purposes and 29 (0.5%) for PGS-SS. 22 Although the ESHRE data represent only a partial record of the PGD cases conducted worldwide, it is indicative of general trends in the field of PGD.

> ...At least 40% to 60% of human embryos are abnormal, and that number increases to 80% in women 40 years or older. These abnormalities result in low implantation rates in embryos transferred during IVF procedures, from 30% in women < 35 years to 6% in women ≥ 40 years. 33 In a recent retrospective review of trophectoderm biopsies, aneuploidy risk was evident with increasing female age. A slightly increased prevalence was noted at younger ages, with > 40% aneuploidy in women ≤ 23 years. The risk of having no chromosomally normal blastocyst for transfer (the no-euploid embryo rate) was lowest (2–6%) in women aged 26 to 37, then rose to 33% at age 42 and reached 53% at age 44. 11

So as a process:

1. harvest x eggs (10-30?)
2. fertilize and create 1-y embryos
3. optional: PGS the embryos
4. culture n embryos to either cleavage (2-4 days) or blastocyte (5-6 days) stage (cleavage: better quality babies, but more likely to fail)
5. optional: embryo selection using quality and PGS
6. implant 1-n embryos
7. freeze the remaining embryos
8. if no live birth, go to #6 or give up

Both Tan et al 2014 and Hodes-Wertz et al 2012 are unrepresentative, since they focused on subjects with particular difficulties or low genetic quality ("They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age", and "Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more failed pregnancies" respectively).

The most nationally representative sample for the USA is the data that fertility clinics are legally required to report to the CDC.
The most recent one is the ["2013 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report"](http://www.cdc.gov/art/pdf/2013-report/art_2013_national_summary_report.pdf), which breaks down numbers by age and egg source:

> ...The largest group of women using ART services were women younger than age 35, representing approximately 38% of all ART cycles performed in 2013. About 20% of ART cycles were performed among women aged 35–37, 19% among women aged 38–40, 11% among women aged 41–42, 7% among women aged 43–44, and 5% among women older than age 44. Figure 4 shows that, in 2013, the type of ART cycles varied by the woman’s age. The vast majority (97%) of women younger than age 35 used their own eggs (nondonor), and about 4% used donor eggs. In contrast, 38% of women aged 43–44 and 73% of women older than age 44 used donor eggs.

> ...Outcomes of ART Cycles Using Fresh Nondonor Eggs or Embryos, by Stage, 2013:
>
> 1. 93,787 cycles started
> 2. 84,868 retrievals
> 3. 73,571 transfers
> 4. 33,425 pregnancies
> 5. 27,406 live-birth deliveries

CDC report doesn't specify how many eggs on average are retrieved or abnormality rate by age, although we can note that ~10% of retrievals didn't lead to any transfers (since there were 85k retrievals but only 74k transfers) which looks consistent with an overall mean & SD of 9(4.6) and 50% abnormality rate.
We could also try to back out from the figures on average number of embryos per transfer, number of transfers, and number of cycles (eg 1.8 for <35yos, and 33750, so 60750 transferred embryos, as part of the 40083 cycles, indicating each cycle must have yielded at least 1.5 embryos), but that only gives a loose lower bound since there may be many left over embryos and the abnormality rate is unknown.

So for an American model of <35yos, we could go with a set of parameters like {9, 4.6, 0.5, 0.96, 0.28}, but this turns out to not match the CDC's P(birth|cycle) of 0.238, since if we count how many simulations yield a baby vs how many simulations we ran, it's twice as much.
Looking at the numbers, the culprit seems to be the P(birth|transfer) estimate of 0.28: each transfer involves *multiple* embryos (1.8 on average), so 0.28 is much larger than the true per-embryo success rate.
Fiddling with the per-embryo rate, the simulation reproduces ~0.238 when the per-embryo rate is ~10.8%

1. <35yo: 23.8->10.8

problem: what's the probability of non-causal tagging due to LD? probably low since they work cross-racially don't they? on the other hand: http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=5415
"If the GWAS SNPs owe their predictive power to being actual causal variants, then LD is irrelevant and they should predict the relevant outcome in any racial group. If however they owe wholly or partly their predictive power to just being statistically related to causal variants, they should be relatively worse predictors in racial groups that are most distantly related. One can investigate this by comparing the predictive power of GWAS betas derived from one population on another population. Since there are by now 1000s of GWAS, meta-analyses have in fact made such comparisons, mostly for disease traits. Two reviews found substantial cross-validity for the Eurasian population (Europeans and East Asians), and less for Africans (usually African Americans) (23,24). The first review only relied on SNPs with p<α and found weaker results. This is expected because using only these is a threshold effect, as discussed earlier.

The second review (from 2013; 299 included GWAS) found much stronger results, probably because it included more SNPs and because they also adjusted for statistical power. Doing so, they found that: ~100% of SNPs replicate in other European samples when accounting for statistical power, ~80% in East Asian samples but only ~10% in the African American sample (not adjusted for statistical power, which was ~60% on average). There were fairly few GWAS for AAs however, so some caution is needed in interpreting the number. Still, this throws some doubt on the usefulness of GWAS results from Europeans or Asians used on African samples (or reversely)."
