> - the cost of embryo selection is modest, at \$1500 + \$200 per embryo, with the sequencing cost projected to drop rapidly
> - a model of the IVF process, incorporating number of extracted eggs, losses to abnormalities & vitrification & failed implantation & miscarriages from 3 real IVF patient populations, estimates feasible gains of 0.14, 0.36, & 0.56 IQ points
> - embryo selection is currently unprofitable (mean: -\$673) in the USA under the lowest estimate of the value of an IQ point, but profitable under the highest (mean: \$4763)
> - under the worst-case estimate, selection can be made profitable with a better polygenic score, which would require _n_>237,300 using education phenotype data (and much less using fluid intelligence measures).

# Embryo selection cost-effectiveness

[In vitro fertilization](!Wikipedia) (IVF) is a medical procedure for infertile women in which eggs are extracted, fertilized with sperm, allowed to develop into an embryo, and the embryo injected into their womb to induce pregnancy.
The choice of embryo is relatively random, with the best looking one implanted; various tests can be run on embryos, including genome sequencing, by extracting a few cells from the embryo.
[Preimplantation genetic profiling / preimplantation genetic diagnosis / preimplantation genetic screening](!Wikipedia "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis") (PGD; [review](/docs/genetics/2013-aa.pdf "'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis guided by single-cell genomics', Van der Aa et al 2013")) is when genetic information is taken and used to choose which embryo to implant.
Currently, embryos are screened for gross abnormalities like the wrong number of chromosomes which would either be fatal to the embryo's development or cause birth defects like Down's (so there is no point in implanting it rather than a healthier embryo).
But with ever cheaper SNP arrays, large amounts of subtler genetic information becomes available, and one could check for abnormalities and also start making predictions about adult phenotypes, and one could choose embryos with higher/lower probability of traits with many known genetic hits such as height or intelligence or alcoholism or schizophrenia - thus, in effect, creating ["designer babies"](!Wikipedia "Designer baby#Preimplantation genetic diagnosis") with proven technology no more exotic than IVF and 23andMe.
For example, increases in height have [long been linked to increased career success & life satisfaction](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/the-financial-perks-of-being-tall/393518/ "The Financial Perks of Being Tall: An extra inch correlates with an estimated $800 in increased annual earnings") with estimates like +\$800 per inch per year income, which combined with polygenic scores predicting [60% of variance](http://neurogenetics.qimrberghofer.edu.au/papers/Wood2014NatGenet.pdf "'Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height', Wood et al 2014") and allowing increases of perhaps 4 inches. But height, or hair color, or other traits are in general far less important to life outcomes than personality or intelligence; since the personality GWASes have had difficulties (probably due to little non-additivity of the relevant genes connected to the predicted frequency-dependent selection), intelligence is the most important case to consider.

In ["Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game-changer?"](/docs/iq/2014-shulman.pdf), Shulman & Bostrom 2014 consider the potential of embryo selection for greater intelligence in a little detail, ultimately concluding that in the most applicable current scenario of minimal uptake (restricted largely to those forced into IVF use) and gains of a few IQ points, embryo selection is more of "curiosity" than "game-changer" as it will be "Socially negligible over one generation. Effects of social controversy more important than direct impacts."

Some things are left out of their analysis which I'm interested in:

1. they give the upper bound on the IQ gain that can be expected from a given level of selection & then-current GCTA heritability estimates, but not the gain that could be expected right now: is it a large or small fraction of that maximum?
2. their level of selection may bear little resemblance to what can be practically obtained given the realities of IVF and high embryo attrition rates (selecting from 1 in 10 embryos may yield _x_ IQ points, but how many real embryos would we need to implement that, since if we extract 10 embryos, 3 might be abnormal, the best candidate might fail to implant, the second-best might result in a miscarriage, etc?)
3. there is no attempt to estimate costs nor whether embryo selection right now is worth the costs, or how much better our selection ability would need to be to make it worthwhile

## Benefit
### Value of IQ

Shulman & Bostrom 2014 note that

> Studies in labor economics typically find that one IQ point corresponds to an increase in wages on the order of 1 per cent, other things equal, though higher estimates are obtained when effects of IQ on educational attainment are included ([Zax and Rees, 2002](http://www.colorado.edu/economics/papers/papers01/wp01-7.pdf "IQ, academic performance, environment, and earnings"); [Neal and Johnson, 1996](http://www.albany.edu/faculty/kretheme/PAD705/PastExams/JPE_RolePreMarketBWWageDiff.pdf "The role of premarket factors in black-white wage differences"); [Cawley et al., 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228308487_Cognitive_Ability_Wages_and_Meritocracy "Cognitive Ability, Wages, and Meritocracy"); [Behrman et al., 2004](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CP+-+Hunger+FINISHED.pdf "Copenhagen Consensus - Challenges and Opportunities: Hunger and Malnutrition"); [Bowles et al., 2002](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=econ_workingpaper "The determinants of individual earnings: Skills, preferences, and schooling"); [Grosse et al., 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240871/ "Economic Gains Resulting from the Reduction in Children's Exposure to Lead in the US")).^2^ The individual increase in earnings from a genetic intervention can be assessed in the same fashion as prenatal care and similar environmental interventions. One study of efforts to avert low birth weight estimated the value of a 1 per cent increase in earnings for a newborn in the US to be between \$2,783 and \$13,744, depending on discount rate and future wage growth ([Brooks-Gunn et al., 2009](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.597.7301&rep=rep1&type=pdf "Long-Run Economic Effects of Early Childhood Programs on Adult Earnings"))^[Brooks-Gunn et al 2009 doesn't report those specific figures; they are inferred from pg27, "Table A1.2 Present value for lifetime earnings of individuals with a high school degree or some college, estimated at birth", which is based on the 2006 March  Current Population Survey's sample with the average level of education. The estimated [net present value](!Wikipedia) for the worst-case (4% discounting, 0% wage growth) lifetime income is \$278,430, and the best-case (2% discount, 2% wage growth) is \$1,374,375. Using the earlier estimate that 1 point = +1% annual wages, then on average, 1 IQ point will translate to a NPV gain of \$2,783 and \$13,744 respectively.]

The given low/high range is based on 2006 data; [inflation-adjusted](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm "CPI Inflation Calculator") to 2016 dollars (as appropriate due to being compared to 2015/2016 costs), that would be \$3,270 and \$16,151.
There is much more that can be said on this topic, starting with various measurements of individuals from income to wealth to correlations with occupational prestige, looking at longitudinal & cross-sectional national wealth data, positive externalities & psychological differences (such as increasing cooperativeness, patience, free-market and moderate politics), verification of causality from longitudinal predictiveness, genetic overlap, within-family comparisons, & exogenous shocks positive (iodization & iron) or negative (lead), etc; an incomplete bibliography:

Estimating the value of an additional IQ point is difficult as there are many perspectives one could take: zero-sum, including only personal earnings or wealth and neglecting all the wealthy produced for society (eg through research), often based on correlating income with intelligence scores or education; positive-sum, attempting to include the positive externalities, perhaps through cross or longitudinal global comparisons, as intelligence predicts later wealth and the wealth of a country is closely linked to the average intelligence of its population which captures many (but not all) of the positive externalities; measures which include the greater longevity & happiness of more intelligent people, etc.
Further, intelligence has intrinsic value of its own, and the genetic hits appear to be pleiotropic and improve other desirable traits; the intelligence/longevity correlation has been found to be due to common genetics, and [Krapohl et al 2015](http://www.hungrymindlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Krapohl-et-al-2015.pdf "Phenome-wide analysis of genome-wide polygenic scores") examines the correlation of polygenic scores with 50 diverse traits, finding that the college/IQ polygenic scores correlate with 10+ of them in generally desirable directions[^Krapohl-phenome], similar to [Hagenaars et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2015225a.html "Shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and physical and mental health in UK Biobank (N=112 151) and 24 GWAS consortia")[^Hagenaars-phenome], indicating both causation for those correlations & benefits beyond income.
There are also pitfalls, like the fallacy of controlling for an intermediate variable, exemplified by studies which attempt to correlate intelligence with income after "controlling for" education, despite knowing that educational attainment is caused *by* intelligence and so their estimates are actually something irrelevant like 'the gain from greater intelligence for reasons other than through its effect on education'.
Estimates have come from a variety of sources, such as iodine and lead studies.
Given the difficulty of coming up with any estimate for 'the' value of an IQ point, I will just reuse the \$3270-16151 range.

[^Krapohl-phenome]: More specifically, combining the College/Adult IQ/Child IQ polygenic scores and including the non-statistically-significant ones, I get out of Figure 1 :

    1. Better: _g_ / Raven's Progressive Matrices / Mill Hill Vocabulary / GCSE English / GCSE maths / GCSE science / PISA Attitudes to School / PISA homework Behaviour / PISA maths self-efficacy / PISA maths interest / PISA time spent on maths / Academic self-concept / Agreeableness / Conscientiousness / Extraversion / Neuroticism / Openness / Curiosity Flow / Chaos at Home / Attachment total / SDQ Total ([Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire](!Wikipedia); behavioral problems) / SDQ Conduct / SDQ Hyperactivity / SDQ Prosocial / Peer Victimization / Conners: Inattention / Conners: Impulsivity / Autism Quotient: Attention Switching / Autism Quotient: Imagination / Autism Quotient: Attention to Detail / Callous Unemotional Traits / ARBQ Anxiety / SANS (negative symptoms) / Grandiosity / Cognitive Disorganization / BMI / Height
    2. Neutral: PISA Homework total / Menarche / Puberty

    (In a few cases it's not clear how to interpret. Is less time on math a good or bad thing since the PISA & GCSE math scores are still higher?)

### Polygenic scores for IQ
#### SNP

Shulman & Bostrom's upper bound works as follows:

> Standard practice today involves the creation of fewer than ten embryos. Selection among greater numbers than that would require multiple IVF cycles, which is expensive and burdensome. Therefore 1-in-10 selection may represent an upper limit of what would currently be practically feasible ...The standard deviation of IQ in the population is about 15. [Davies et al. (2011)](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/full/mp201185a.html "Genome-wide association studies establish that human intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic") estimates that common additive variation can account for half of variance in adult fluid intelligence in its sample. Siblings share half their genetic material on average. Thus, in a crude estimate, variance is cut by 75 per cent and standard deviation by 50 per cent. Adjustments for assortative mating, deviation from the Gaussian distribution, and other factors would adjust this estimate, but not drastically. These figures were generated by simulating 10 million couples producing the listed number of embryos and selecting the one with the highest predicted IQ based on the additive variation.
>
> Table 1. How the maximum amount of IQ gain (assuming a Gaussian distribution of predicted IQs among the embryos with a standard deviation of 7.5 points) might depend on the number of embryos used in selection:
>
> Selection    Average IQ gain
> ----------   ---------------
> 1 in 2       4.2
> 1 in 10      11.5
> 1 in 100     18.8
> 1 in 1000    24.3

That is, adult intelligence is heritable at ~0.8; a SNP chip records the few hundred thousand most common genetic variants in the population and treating each gene as having a simple additive increase-or-decrease effect on intelligence, Davies et al 2011's GCTA (Genome-wide complex trait analysis) estimates that those SNPs are responsible for 0.51 of variance; since siblings descend from the same two parents, they will share half the variants (just like dizygotic twins) and differ on the rest, so the SNPs can only predict up to 0.25 between siblings and siblings are analogous to multiple embryos being considered for implantation in IVF; simulate _n_ embryos by drawing from a normal distribution with a SD of 0.7 or 10.5 IQ points and selecting the highest, and with various _n_, you get something like the table.

GCTA tells us how much the SNPs would explain if we knew all their effects exactly, but in practice, there are so many SNPs (likely into the thousands) affecting intelligence, only a few are known to a high level of confidence, and the rest will take much larger samples to pin down, so the table represents an upper limit to SNP-based approaches - to approach the 0.51, we will need large sample sizes, and to exceed it and approach the 0.8, we will need whole genomes and models which can go beyond additive estimates to model interactions (like genes which only increase intelligence in the presence of particular other variants).

##### GCTA meta-analysis

Davies et al 2011's 0.5 is a little outdated and small, based on _n_=3511 with correspondingly large imprecision in the GCTA estimates.
I was able to find in total the following GCTA estimates:

0. ["Genome-wide association studies establish that human intelligence is highly heritable and polygenic"](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/full/mp201185a.html), Davies et al 2011 ([supplementary](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n10/extref/mp201185x1.doc))

  0.51(0.11); but Supplementary Table 1 (pg1) actually reports in the combined sample, the "no cut-off _g~f~_ _h_^2" equals 0.53(0.10). The 0.51 estimate is drawn from a cryptic relatedness cutoff of <0.025. The samples are also reported aggregated into Scottish & English samples: 0.17 (0.20) & 0.99 (0.22) respectively. Sample ages:

    1. Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (Scottish): _n_=550, 79.1 years average
    2. Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (Scottish): _n_=1091, 69.5 years average
    3. Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936 (Scottish): _n_=498, 64.6 years average
    4. Manchester and Newcastle longitudinal studies of cognitive aging cohorts (English): _n_=6063, 65 years median

    GCTA is not reported for the Norwegian, and not reported for the 4 samples individually, so I code Davies et al 2011 as 2 samples with weighted-averages for ages (70.82 and 65 respectively) <!-- (550*79.1 + 1091*69.5 + 498*64.6) / (550+1091+498) -->

    0.47; no measure of precision reported in paper or supplementary information but the relevant sample seems to be _n_=2,441 and so the standard error will be high.

    The article reports doing GCTAs only on the ARIC & HRS samples, but Figure 4 shows a forest plot which includes GCTA estimates from two other groups, CAGES ("Cognitive Ageing Genetics in England and Scotland Consortium") at ~0.5 & GS ("Generation Scotland") at ~0.25. The CAGES datapoint is cited to Davies et al 2011, which did report 0.51, and the GS citation is incorrect; so presumably those two datapoints were previously reported GCTA estimates which Davies et al 2015 was meta-analyzing together with their 2 new ARIC/HS estimates, and they simply didn't mention that.

The earlier estimates tend to be smaller samples and higher, and as heritability increases with age, it's not surprising that the GCTA estimates of SNP contribution also increases with age.
[Jian Yang](http://gcta.freeforums.net/thread/213/analysis-greml-results-multiple-cohorts) says that GCTA estimates can be meta-analytically combined straightforwardly in the usual way.

~~~

(Oddly, the estimates decrease with age rather than increase.
I thought this might be driven by the samples using twins, which have been accused in the past of delivering higher heritability estimates due to higher SES of parents and correspondingly less environmental influence, but when added as a predictor, twin samples are non-statistically-significantly lower.
My best guess so far is that the apparent trend is due to a lack of middle-aged samples: the studies jump all the way from 14yo to 57yo, so the usual quadratic curve of increasing heritability could be hidden and look flat, since the high estimates will all be missing from the middle.)

![Forest plot for meta-analysis of GCTA estimates of total additive SNPs' effect on intelligence/cognitive-ability](/images/iq-gcta-forest.png)

##### GCTA-based upper bound

Since half of additives will be shared within family, then we get `0.33*0.5 = 0.165` within-family variance, which gives `sqrt(0.165) = 0.4062019202` SD or 6.1 IQ points
(Occasionally within-family differences are cited in a format like "siblings have an average difference of 12 IQ points", which comes from an SD of ~0.7/0.8, since `0.8*15=12`, but you could also check what SD yields an average difference of 12 via simulation: eg `mean(abs(rnorm(n=10000000, mean=0, sd=0.71) - rnorm(n=10000000, mean=0, sd=0.71))) * 15 ~> 12.01807542`.)
We don't care about means since we're only looking at gains, so the mean of the within-family normal distribution can be set to 0.

With that, we can write a simulation like Shulman & Bostrom where we generate _n_ samples from N(0, 6.1), take the max, and return the difference of the max and mean:

<!-- TODO: remove the IQ hardwiring in function names and the 15 constant, to make code work for generic additive embryo selection -->

~~~{.R}
## select 1 out of N siblings
embryoIQScores <- function(n, variance) { rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=sqrt(variance*0.5)*15); }
embryoSelectionGain <- function(n, variance) { scores <- embryoIQScores(n, variance); return(max(scores) - mean(scores)); }
simEmbryoSelection <- function(n=2, variance=0.33, iters=100000) { replicate(iters, embryoSelectionGain(n, variance)); }
mean(simEmbryoSelection(n=10))
# [1] 9.368836794
~~~

So 1 out of 10 gives a maximal average gain of ~9 IQ points, less than Shulman & Bostrom's 11.5 because of my lower GCTA estimate.
For comparison, the full genetic heritability of adult IQ (including SNPs, mutation load & de novo mutations, copy-number variation, etc) is generally estimated ~0.8, and the upper bound would be ~14.5 IQ points:

~~~{.R}
mean(simEmbryoSelection(n=10, variance=0.8))
# [1] 14.61386652
~~~

##### Polygenic scores

A SNP-based polygenic score works much the same way: it explains a certain fraction or percentage of the variance, halved due to siblings, and can be plugged in once we know how much less than 0.33 it is.
An example of using SNP polygenic scores to identify genetic influences and verify they work within-family and are not confounded would be Domingue et al 2015's ["Polygenic Influence on Educational Attainment"](http://ero.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2332858415599972?full).
Past polygenic scores for intelligence:

2. ["GWAS of 126,559 Individuals Identifies Genetic Variants Associated with Educational Attainment"](/docs/iq/2013-rietveld.pdf), Rietveld et al 2013:

    This landmark study providing the first GWAS hits on intelligence also estimated multiple polygenic scores: the full polygenic scores predicted 2.5% of variance in cognitive function in a Swedish replication sample, and also performed well in within-family settings (0.31% & 0.19% of variance in attending college & years of education, respectively, in [Table S25](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2013/05/29/science.1235488.DC1/Rietveld.SM.revision.2.pdf)).

Particularly intriguing given its investigation of pleiotropy is Supplementary Table 5, which uses polygenic scores constructed for all the diseases in its data (eg type 2 diabetes, ADHD, schizophrenia, coronary artery disease), where all the disease scores & covariates are entered into the model and then the cognitive polygenic scores are able to predict even higher, as high as R^2^=0.063/0.046/0.064.

Upcoming in 2016 is another SSGAC paper with ~8x hits using _n_=305,000 but [neither](http://drjamesthompson.blogspot.com/2015/09/scholar-in-86-snps.html) [talk's](http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2015/06/more-gwas-hits-on-cognitive-ability.html) summary gives the polygenic score, although the top 18 hits explained 0.4% (but that's less than the Davies or Rietveld polygenic scores and not useful)

Since these scores overlap and are not, like GCTA estimates, repeated measurements of a variable in any sense, there is little point in meta-analyzing them other than to estimate growth over time (even using them as an ensemble wouldn't be worth the complexity, and in any case, most studies do not provide the full list of beta values making up the polygenic score); for our purpose, the largest polygenic score is the important number.
([Emil Kirkegaard](http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=5813) notes that the polygenic scores are also inefficient: polygenic scores are not always published, not always based on individual patient data, and generally use maximum-likelihood estimation neglecting our strong priors on the number of hits & distribution of effect sizes. But these published scores are what we have as of January 2016, so we must make do.)

Rietveld et al 2013's reported polygenic score for cognitive performance was 2.5%. Same procedure to estimate value of embryo selection: halve to account for siblings' shared genetics then simulate:
`0.025 * 0.5 = 0.0125`; `sqrt(0.0125) = 0.1118033989` SD or 1.67 IQ points

## Cost of embryo selection

PGD is currently [legal everywhere in the USA](!Wikipedia "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis#United States"), so there are no criminal or legal costs; even if there were, clinics in other countries will continue to offer it, and the cost of using a Chinese fertility clinic may not be particularly noticeable.[^China-trip]

[^China-trip]: We could consider a hypothetical trip to China to make use of fertility clinics there. How much additional would one pay?

    Costs:

    - US passport costs ~\$110
    - a Chinese visa costs [\$140](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/visas/fees/t1236036.htm)
    - a Shanghai to San Francisco round-trip flight prices out currently in the range \$500-\$1000 (lower than I expected, perhaps due to the 2015 oil glut)
    - IVF is a long and involved process, so one should budget for at least 3 months residence: [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/money-costs) thinks that on a shoestring budget one can manage >\$30/day, so `3*31*30=$2790`.
    - IVF is also unpleasant enough that it would be wrong to consider those 3 months a vacation and one has to consider the impact of being away from one's job for such an extended period of time (as remote working is not an option for most people & the Great Firewall would impede that as well); so since 2013 US per capita income was \$53.8, those 3 months would cost on average somewhere <\$13.4k
    - Summing up: `110+140+2790+13400=$16.4k`.

    On the plus side:

    - Chinese IVF fertility clinics are presumably cheaper as well as more willing to do PGD. A [2011 NPR article](http://www.npr.org/2011/07/01/137530286/in-china-an-ivf-clinic-grapples-with-huge-demand) quotes a Chinese fertility clinic as offering 1 cycle at \$4.5k, which is around half of what a US clinic might charge; so the total penalty of going to China will depend on how many cycles are necessary. If 1 cycle, then it's \$10k vs \$16k+\$4.5k, a loss of -\$10.5k; for 2, -\$5k; for 3, +\$0.5k; and for 4, +\$6k, and so on.

        IVF cycle success rates being <41% and following a negative binomial, we can say that 2 or more cycles will be required, more often than not, and often 3 or 4, to get 1 live birth (after which it stops); one issue is that if a woman leaves as soon as pregnancy is confirmed with a fetal heartbeat, there may still be a miscarriage and they would have to decide whether to fly back to China and start another cycle, while if they stay for the full pregnancy, that triples food/hotel costs. Quality-wise, Chinese fertility clinics may be behind Western clinics, but we can expect them to rapidly improve: the Chinese population is aging and becoming more affluent, the one-child policy is dead, and the Chinese government has made biology & genetic engineering a national strategic priority and bankrolled R&D and institutes like the [Beijing Genomics Institute](!Wikipedia). To quote [one article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-s-bold-push-into-genetically-customized-animals/ "China's Bold Push into Genetically Customized Animals: New kinds of dogs, goats and monkeys are being made quickly, although scientists voice worries about ethics and whether the methods should be used on humans") :

    > Dozens, if not hundreds, of Chinese institutions in both research hubs like Beijing and far-flung provincial outposts have enthusiastically deployed CRISPR. "It's a priority area for the Chinese Academy of Sciences," says Minhua Hu, a geneticist at the Guangzhou General Pharmaceutical Research Institute and one of the beagle researchers. A colleague, Liangxue Lai of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, adds that "China's government has allocated a lot of financial support in genetically modified animals in both [the] agriculture field [and the] biomedicine field."...The level and sophistication of work in China using CRISPR is already "about the same" as in Europe and the U.S., says [George Church](!Wikipedia "George M. Church"), a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. An analysis by Thomson Innovation, a division of London-based Thomson Reuters, found that more than 50 Chinese research institutions have filed gene-editing patents.

    They are expected to approve agricultural-related modifications before the USA; [_Nature_](http://www.nature.com/news/super-muscly-pigs-created-by-small-genetic-tweak-1.17874 "Super-muscly pigs created by small genetic tweak: Researchers hope the genetically engineered animals will speed past regulators"):

    > Kim hopes to market the edited pig sperm to farmers in China, where demand for pork is on the rise. The regulatory climate there may favour his plan. China is investing heavily in gene editing and historically has a lax regulatory system, says Ishii. Regulators will be cautious, he says, but some might exempt genetic engineering that does not involve gene transfer from strict regulations. "I think China will go first," says Kim.

    So overall, I think we can say that on average, doing IVF in China is not as financially costly as it seems up front and could even be profitable. Which leaves the more psychological issues of trust and planning and willingness to go overseas, which are hard to evaluate in the absence of any present incentive to do Chinese genetic-engineering birth tourism, but [medical tourism](!Wikipedia) and [birth tourism](!Wikipedia) are both already phenomena.

### Cost of polygenic scores

An upper bound is the cost of whole-gnome sequencing, which has continuously fallen. My impression is that historically, a whole-genome has cost ~6x a comprehensive SNP (500k+).
The [NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program's DNA Sequencing Cost dataset](http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) records an [October 2015 whole-genome cost of \$1245](http://www.genome.gov/pages/der/seqcost2015_4.xlsx).
Illumina has boasted about a \$1000 whole-genome starting around 2014 (under an unspecified cost model), and around December 2015, Veritas Genetics started taking orders for a consumer 20x whole-genome priced at \$1000.
So if a comprehensive SNP cost >\$1000, it would be cheaper to do a whole-genome, and historically at that price, we would expect a SNP cost of ~\$170.

The date & cost of getting a large selection of SNPs is not collected in any dataset I know of, so here are a few 2014-2016 price quotes.
Hsu 2014 estimates an SNP costs "~\$100 USD" and "At the time of this writing SNP genotyping costs are below \$50 USD per individual", without specifying a source; given the latter is below any 23andMe price offered, it is probably an internal Beijing Genomics Institute cost estimate.
The [Center for Applied Genomics price list](https://caglab.org/index.php/for-researchers/pricing-and-services.html) (unspecified date but presumably 2015) lists [Affymetrix SNP 6.0](http://www.affymetrix.com/catalog/131533/AFFY/Genome-Wide+Human+SNP+Array+6.0) at \$355 & the [Human Omni Express-24](http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/brochures/datasheet_omni_whole-genome_arrays.pdf) at \$170.
23andMe famously offered its services for \$108.95 for >600k SNPs as of October 2014, but that price apparently was substantially subsidized by research & sales as they raised the price to \$200 & lowered comprehensiveness in October 2015.
[NIH CIDR's price list](http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/services/pricing.pdf) quotes a full cost of \$150-\$210 for 1 use of a UK Biobank 821K SNP Axiom Array ([capabilities](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UK-Biobank-Axiom-Array-Content-Summary-2014.pdf)) as of 10 December 2015. (The NIH CIDR price list also says \$40 for 96 SNPs, suggesting that it would be a false economy to try to get only the top few SNP hits rather than a comprehensive polygenic score.)
[Rockefeller University's 2016 price list](http://www.rockefeller.edu/genomics/pricing) quotes a range of \$260-\$520 for one sample from an Affymetrix GeneChip.
Tan et al 2014 note that for PGD purposes, "the estimated reagent cost of sequencing for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities is currently less than \$100."

Overall, SNPing an embryo in 2016 should cost ~\$100-400 and more like \$200 and we can expect the SNP cost to fall further.

#### SNP cost forecast

How much will SNP costs drop in the future?

We can extrapolate from the genome sequencing data, but it's tricky: eyeballing the graph, we can see that historical prices have not followed any simple pattern.
At first, costs closely tracks a simple halving every 18 months, then there is an abrupt trend-break to super-exponential drops from mid-2007 to mid-2011 and then an equally abrupt reversion to a flat cost trajectory with occasional price *increases* and then another abrupt fall in early 2015 (accentuated when one adds in the Veritas Genetics \$1k as a datapoint).

Dropping pre-2007 data and fitting an exponential shows a bad fit since 2012 (if it follows the pre-2015 curve, it has large prediction errors on 2015-2016 and vice-versa).
It's probably better to take the last 3 datapoints (the current trend) and fit the curve to them, covering just the past 6 months since July 2015, and then applying the 6x rule of thumb we can predict SNP costs out 20 months to October 2017:

~~~

(Even if SNP prices stagnate due to lack of competition or fixed-costs/overhead/small-scales, whole-genomes will simply eat their lunch: at the current trend, whole-genomes will reach \$200 ~2019 and \$100 ~2020.)

### PGD net costs

An IVF cycle involving PGD will need ~4-5 SNPs (given a median egg count of 9 and half being abnormal), so I estimate the genetic part costs ~\$800-1000.
The net cost of PGD will include the cell harvesting part (one needs to extract cells from embryos to sequence) and interpretation (although scoring and checking the genetic data for abnormality should be automatable), so we can compare with current PGD price quotes.

- "The Fertility Institutes" say ["Average costs for the medical and genetic portions of the service provided by the Fertility Institutes approach $27,000 U.S"](http://www.fertility-docs.com/programs-and-services/pgd-screening/genetic-diagnosis-of-embryos-for-diseases-using-pgd.php) (unspecified date) without breaking out the PGD part
- [Genetic Alliance UK](http://www.geneticalliance.org.uk/aboutpgd.htm#Question6) claims (in 2012, based on PDF creation date) that "The cost of PGD is typically split into two parts: procedural costs (consultations, laboratory testing, egg collection, embryo transfer, ultrasound scans, and blood tests) and drug costs (for ovarian stimulation and embryo transfer). PGD combined with IVF will cost £6,000 [\$8.5k] - £9,000 [\$12.8k] per treatment cycle." but doesn't specify the marginal cost of the PGD rather than IVF part
- [Alzforum](http://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/preimplantation-genetic-diagnosis-its-no-walk-park "Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis: It's No Walk in the Park") (July 2014): "In Madison, Wisconsin, genetic counselor Margo Grady at Generations Fertility Care estimated the out-of-pocket price of one IVF cycle at about \$12,000, and PGD adds another \$3,000."
- [Reproductive Health Technologies Project](http://www.rhtp.org/fertility/pgd/) (2015?): "One round of IVF typically costs around \$9,000. PGD adds another \$4,000 to \$7,500 to the cost of each IVF attempt. A standard round of IVF results in a successful pregnancy only 10-35% of the time (depending on the age and health of the woman), and a woman may need to undergo subsequent attempts to achieve a viable pregnancy."
- [SDFC](https://www.sdfertility.com/fertility-treatments/genetic-testing/pgd) (2015?): "PGD typically costs between \$4,000-\$10,000 depending on the cost of creating the specific probe used to detect the presence of a single gene."
- Murugappan et al May 2015: "The average cost of PGS was \$4,268 (range \$3,155-\$12,626)", citing another study which estimated "Average additional cost of PGD procedure: \$3,550; Median Cost: \$3,200"
- the [Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago](http://www.advancedfertility.com/pgd-costs.htm) ("current" pricing, so 2015?) says IVF costs ~$12k and of that, "Aneuploidy testing (for chromosome normality) with PGD is \$1800 to \$5000...PGD costs in the US vary from about \$4000-\$8000". AFC usefully breaks down the costs further in a table of "Average PGS IVF Costs in USA", saying that:

    > - Embryo biopsy charges are about \$1000 to \$2500 (average: \$1500)
    > - Embryo freezing costs are usually between \$500 to \$1000 (average: \$750)
    > - Aneuploidy testing (for chromosome normality) with PGD is \$1800 to \$5000
    > - For single gene defects (such as cystic fibrosis), there are additional costs involved.
    > - PGS test cost average: \$3500

    (The wording is unclear about whether these are costs per *embryo* or per *batch* of embryos; but the rest of the page implies that it's per batch, and per embryo would imply that the other PGS cost estimates are either far too low or are being done on only one embryo & likely would fail.)

From the final AFC costs, we can see that the genetic testing makes up a large fraction of the cost.
Since custom markers are not necessary and we are only looking at standard SNPs, the \$1.8-5k genetic cost is a huge overestimate of the \$1k the SNPs should cost now or soon.
Their breakdown also implies that the embryo freezing/vitrification cost is counted as part of the PGS cost, but I don't think this is right since one will need to store embryos regardless of whether one is doing PGS/selection (even if an embryo is going to be implanted right away in a live transfer, the other embryos need to be stored since the first one will probably fail).
So the critical number here is that the embryo biopsy step costs \$1500; there is probably little prospect of large price decreases here and we can take it as fixed.

Hence we can model the cost of embryo selection as a fixed \$1.5k cost plus number of embryos times SNP cost.

## Modeling embryo selection

[In vitro fertilization](!Wikipedia) is a sequential probabilistic process:

1. harvest _x_ eggs
2. fertilize them and create _x_ embryos
3. culture the embryos to either cleavage (2-4 days) or blastocyst (5-6 days) stage; of them, _y_ will still be alive & not grossly abnormal
4. freeze the embryos
5. optional: embryo selection using quality and PGS
6. unfreeze & implant 1 embryo; if no embryos left, return to #1 or give up
7. if no live birth, go to #6

(Each step is necessary and determines input into the next step; it is a 'leaky pipeline', whose total yield depends heavily on the least efficient step, so outcomes might be [distributed log-normally](!Wikipedia "Log-normal distribution").)
A simulation of this process:

~~~{.R}
simulateIVF <- function (eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP=0.5, vitrificationP, liveBirth) {
  eggsExtracted <- max(0, round(rnorm(n=1, mean=eggMean, sd=eggSD)))

  normal        <- rbinom(1, eggsExtracted, prob=normalityP)

  scores        <- embryoIQScores(n=normal, variance=polygenicScoreVariance)

  survived      <- Filter(function(x){rbinom(1, 1, prob=vitrificationP)}, scores)

  selection <- sort(survived, decreasing=TRUE)
  if (length(selection)>0) {
   for (embryo in 1:length(selection)) {
   if (rbinom(1, 1, prob=liveBirth) == 1) {
     live <- selection[embryo]
     return(live)
     }
     }
    }
  }
simulateIVFs <- function(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth, iters=100000) {
  return(unlist(replicate(iters, simulateIVF(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth)))); }
~~~

The transition probabilities can be estimated from the flows reported in papers dealing with IVF and PGD. I have used:

1. ["Clinical outcome of preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening using next generation sequencing"](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/pdf/2047-217X-3-30.pdf), Tan et al December 2014:

    395 women, 1512 eggs successfully extracted & fertilized into blastocysts (~3.8 per woman); after genetic testing, 256+590=846 or 55% were abnormal & could not be used, leaving 666 good ones; all were vitrified for storage during analysis and 421 of the normal ones rethawed, leaving 406 useful survivors or ~1.4 per woman; the 406 were implanted into 252 women, yielding 24+75=99 healthy live births or 24% implanted-embryo->birth rate. Excerpts:

    > A total of 395 couples participated. They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age. A total of 1,512 blastocysts were biopsied on D5 after fertilization, with 1,058 blastocysts set aside for SNP array testing and 454 blastocysts for NGS testing. In the NGS cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 52.6% (60/114), 61.3% (49/80) and 14.3% (7/49), respectively. In the SNP array cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 47.6% (139/292), 56.7% (115/203) and 14.8% (17/115), respectively. The outcome measures of both the NGS and SNP array cycles were the same with insignificant differences. There were 150 blastocysts that underwent both NGS and SNP array analysis, of which seven blastocysts were found with inconsistent signals. All other signals obtained from NGS analysis were confirmed to be accurate by validation with qPCR. The relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for each blastocyst that underwent NGS testing was evaluated, and a significant difference was found between the copy number of mtDNA for the euploid and the chromosomally abnormal blastocysts. So far, out of 42 ongoing pregnancies, 24 babies were born in NGS cycles; all of these babies are healthy and free of any developmental problems.
    >
    > ...The median number of normal/ balanced embryos per couple was 1.76 (range from 0 to 8)...Among the 129 couples in the NGS cycles group, 33 couples had no euploid embryos suitable for transfer; 75 couples underwent embryo transfer and the remaining 21 couples are currently still waiting for transfer. In the SNP array cycles group, 177 couples underwent embryo transfer, 66 couples had no suitable embryos for transfer, and 23 couples are currently still waiting. Of the 666 normal/balanced blastocysts, 421 blastocysts were warmed after vitrification, 406 survived (96.4% of survival rate) and were transferred in 283 cycles. The numbers of blastocysts transferred per cycle were 1.425 (114/80) and 1.438 (292/203) for NGS and SNP array, respectively. The proportion of transferred embryos that successfully implanted was evaluated by ultrasound 6-7 weeks after embryo transfer, indicating that 60 and 139 embryos resulted in a fetal sac, giving implantation rates of 52.6% (60/114) and 47.6% (139/292) for NGS and SNP array, respectively. Prenatal diagnosis with karyotyping of amniocentesis fluid samples did not find any fetus with chromosomal abnormalities. A total of 164 pregnancies were detected, with 129 singletons and 35 twins. The clinical pregnancy rate per transfer cycle was 61.3% (49/80) and 56.7% (115/203) for NGS and SNP array, respectively (Table 3). A total of 24 miscarriages were detected, giving rates of 14.3% (7/49) and 14.8% (17/115) in NGS and SNP array cycles, respectively
    >
    > ...The ongoing pregnancy rates were 52.5% (42/80) and 48.3% (98/203) in NGS and SNP array cycles, respectively. Out of these pregnancies, 24 babies were delivered in 20 NGS cycles; so far, all the babies are healthy and chromosomally normal according to karyotype analysis. In the SNP array cycles group the outcome of all pregnancies went to full term and 75 healthy babies were delivered (Table 3)...NGS is with a bright prospect. A case report described the use of NGS for PGD recently [33]. Several comments for the application of NGS/MPS in PGD/PGS were published [34,35]. The cost and time of sequencing is already competitive with array tests, and the estimated reagent cost of sequencing for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities is currently less than \$100.
2. ["Cost-effectiveness analysis of preimplantation genetic screening and in vitro fertilization versus expectant management in patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss"](/docs/genetics/2015-murugappan.pdf), Murugappan et al May 2015:

    > Probabilities for clinical outcomes with IVF and PGS in RPL patients were obtained from a 2012 study by Hodes-Wertz et al. (10). This is the single largest study to date of outcomes using 24-chromosome screening by array comparative genomic hybridization in a well-defined RPL population...The Hodes-Wertz study reported on outcomes of 287 cycles of IVF with 24-chromosome PGS with a total of 2,282 embryos followed by fresh day-5 embryo transfer in RPL patients. Of the PGS cycles, 67% were biopsied on day 3, and 33% were biopsied on day 5. The average maternal age was 36.7 years (range: 21-45 years), and the mean number of prior miscarriages was 3.3 (range: 2-7). From 287 PGS cycles, 181 cycles had at least one euploid embryo and proceeded to fresh embryo transfer. There were 52 cycles with no euploid embryos for transfer, four cycles where an embryo transfer had not taken place at the time of analysis, and 51 cycles that were lost to follow-up observation. All patients with a euploid embryo proceeded to embryo transfer, with an average of 1.65 Æ 0.65 (range: 1-4) embryos per transfer. Excluding the cycles lost to follow-up evaluation and the cycles without a transfer at the time of analysis, the clinical pregnancy rate per attempt was 44% (n 1⁄4 102). One attempt at conception was defined as an IVF cycle and oocyte retrieval Æ embryo transfer. The live-birth rate per attempt was 40% (n1⁄4 94), and the miscarriage rate per pregnancy was 7% (n 1⁄4 7). Of these seven miscarriages, 57% (n 1⁄4 4) occurred after detection of fetal cardiac activity (10). Information on the percent- age of cycles with surplus embryos was not provided in the Hodes-Wertz study, so we drew from their database of 240 RPL patients with 118 attempts at IVF and PGS (12). The clinical pregnancy, live-birth, and clinical miscarriage rates did not statistically significantly differ between the outcomes published in the Hodes-Wertz study (P1⁄4 .89, P1⁄4 .66, P1⁄4 .61, respectively). We reported that 62% of IVF cycles had at least one surplus embryo (12).
    >
    > ...The average cost of preconception counseling and baseline RPL workup, including parental karyotyping, maternal antiphospholipid antibody testing, and uterine cavity evaluation, was \$4,377 (range: \$4,000-\$5,000) (16). Because this was incurred by both groups before their entry into the decision tree, it was not included as a cost input in the study. The average cost of IVF was \$18,227 (range: \$6,920-\$27,685) (16) and includes cycle medications, oocyte retrieval, and one embryo transfer. The average cost of PGS was \$4,268 (range \$3,155-\$12,626) (17), and the average cost of a frozen embryo transfer was \$6,395 (range: \$3,155-\$12,626) (13, 16). The average cost of managing a clinical miscarriage with dilation and curettage (D&C) was \$1,304 (range: \$517-\$2,058) (18). Costs incurred in the IVF-PGS strategy include the cost of IVF, PGS, fresh embryo transfer, frozen embryo transfer, and D&C. Costs incurred in the expectant management strategy include only the cost of D&C.

    > The number of diseases currently diagnosed via PGD-PCR is approximately 200 and includes some forms of inherited cancers such as retinoblastoma and the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA2). 52 PGD has also been used in new applications such as HLA matching. 53,54 The ESHRE PGD consortium data analysis of the past 10 years' experience demonstrated a clinical pregnancy rate of 22% per oocyte retrieval and 29% per embryo transfer. 55 Table 4 shows a sample of the different monogenetic diseases for which PGD was carried out between January and December 2009, according to the ESHRE data. 22 In these reports a total of 6160 cycles of IVF cycles with PGD or PGS, including PGS-SS, are presented. Of these, 2580 (41.8%) were carried out for PGD purposes, in which 1597 cycles were performed for single-gene disorders, including HLA typing. An additional 3551 (57.6%) cycles were carried out for PGS purposes and 29 (0.5%) for PGS-SS. 22 Although the ESHRE data represent only a partial record of the PGD cases conducted worldwide, it is indicative of general trends in the field of PGD.

    > ...At least 40% to 60% of human embryos are abnormal, and that number increases to 80% in women 40 years or older. These abnormalities result in low implantation rates in embryos transferred during IVF procedures, from 30% in women < 35 years to 6% in women ≥ 40 years. 33 In a recent retrospective review of trophectoderm biopsies, aneuploidy risk was evident with increasing female age. A slightly increased prevalence was noted at younger ages, with > 40% aneuploidy in women ≤ 23 years. The risk of having no chromosomally normal blastocyst for transfer (the no-euploid embryo rate) was lowest (2-6%) in women aged 26 to 37, then rose to 33% at age 42 and reached 53% at age 44. 11

    > The median number of eggs retrieved was 9 [inter-quartile range (IQR) 6-13; Fig. 2a] and the median number of embryos created was 5 (IQR 3-8; Fig. 2b). The overall LBR in the entire cohort was 21.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21.2-21.4%], with a gradual rise over the four time periods in this study (14.9% in 1991-1995, 19.8% in 1996-2000, 23.2% in 2001-2005 and 25.6% in 2006-2008).

    Egg retrieval appears [normally distributed in Sunkara et al 2011's graph](http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/7/1768/F2.large.jpg). The SD is not given anywhere in the paper, but an SD of ~4-5 visually fits the graph and is compatible with a 6-13 IQR, and [AGC](http://www.advancedfertility.com/bmi-ivf-eggs-research.htm) reports SDs for eggs for two groups of SDs 4.5 & 4.7 and averages of 10.5 & 9.4 - closely matching the median of 9.
6. The most nationally representative sample for the USA is the data that fertility clinics are legally required to report to the CDC. The most recent one is the ["2013 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report"](http://www.cdc.gov/art/pdf/2013-report/art_2013_national_summary_report.pdf), which breaks down numbers by age and egg source:

    > Total number of cycles : 190,773 (includes 2,655 cycle[s] using frozen eggs)...Donor eggs: 9718 fresh cycles, 10270 frozen [`(9718+10270)/190773 ~> 0.1047737363`]
    >
    > ...Of the 190,773 ART cycles performed in 2013 at these reporting clinics, 163,209 cycles (86%) were started with the intent to transfer at least one embryo. These 163,209 cycles resulted in 54,323 live births (deliveries of one or more living infants) and 67,996 infants.

    > ...The largest group of women using ART services were women younger than age 35, representing approximately 38% of all ART cycles performed in 2013. About 20% of ART cycles were performed among women aged 35-37, 19% among women aged 38-40, 11% among women aged 41-42, 7% among women aged 43-44, and 5% among women older than age 44. Figure 4 shows that, in 2013, the type of ART cycles varied by the woman's age. The vast majority (97%) of women younger than age 35 used their own eggs (non-donor), and about 4% used donor eggs. In contrast, 38% of women aged 43-44 and 73% of women older than age 44 used donor eggs.
    >
    > ...Outcomes of ART Cycles Using Fresh Non-donor Eggs or Embryos, by Stage, 2013:
    >
    > 1. 93,787 cycles started
    > 2. 84,868 retrievals
    > 3. 73,571 transfers
    > 4. 33,425 pregnancies
    > 5. 27,406 live-birth deliveries

    CDC report doesn't specify how many eggs on average are retrieved or abnormality rate by age, although we can note that ~10% of retrievals didn't lead to any transfers (since there were 85k retrievals but only 74k transfers) which looks consistent with an overall mean & SD of 9(4.6) and 50% abnormality rate.
    We could also try to back out from the figures on average number of embryos per transfer, number of transfers, and number of cycles (eg 1.8 for <35yos, and 33750, so 60750 transferred embryos, as part of the 40083 cycles, indicating each cycle must have yielded at least 1.5 embryos), but that only gives a loose lower bound since there may be many left over embryos and the abnormality rate is unknown.

    So for an American model of <35yos, we could go with a set of parameters like {9, 4.6, 0.5, 0.96, 0.28}.

With these sets of data, we can fill in parameter values for the simulation and estimate gains.

Using the Tan et al 2014 data:

1. eggs extracted per person: normal distribution, mean=3, SD=4.6 (discretized into whole numbers)
2. using previous simulation, 'SNP test' all eggs extracted for polygenic score
2. P=0.5 that an egg is normal
3. P=0.96 that it survives vitrification
4. P=0.24 that an implanted egg yields a birth

~~~{.R}
simulateTan <- function() { return(simulateIVFs(3, 4.6, rietveld2013, 0.5, 0.96, 0.24)); }
iqTan <- mean(simulateTan()); iqTan
# [1] 0.3169408043
~~~

That is, the couples in Tan et al 2014 would have seen a 0.3IQ increase.

The Murugappan et al 2015 cost-benefit analysis uses data from American fertility clinics reported in [Hodes-Wertz's "Idiopathic recurrent miscarriage is caused mostly by aneuploid embryos"](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamie_Grifo/publication/225286057_Idiopathic_recurrent_miscarriage_is_caused_mostly_by_aneuploid_embryos/links/00b4951fbe350b4300000000.pdf):
278 cycles yielding 2282 blastocysts or ~8.2 on average; 35% normal; there is no mention of losses to cryostorage, so I borrow 0.96 from Tan et al 2015; 1.65 implanted on average in 181 transfers, yielding 40% live-births.
So:

~~~{.R}
simulateHodesWertz <- function() { return(simulateIVFs(8.2, 4.6, rietveld2013, 0.35, 0.96, 0.40)) }
iqHW <- mean(simulateHodesWertz()); iqHW
# [1] 0.5666326846
~~~

Both Tan et al 2014 and Hodes-Wertz et al 2012 are unrepresentative, since they focused on subjects with particular difficulties or low genetic quality ("They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age", and "Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more failed pregnancies" respectively).
The more nationally representative USA data from the CDC reports net numbers rather than per step, but using the imputed probabilities:

~~~{.R}
simulateUSA <- function(liveBirth) { return(simulateIVFs(9, 4.6, rietveld2013, 0.3, 0.90, liveBirth)); };
iqUSA <- sapply(c(10.8, 8.6, 5.7, 3.2, 1.56, 0.49)/100, function(lb){mean(simulateUSA(lb));}); iqUSA

### Societal effects

One category of effects considered by Shulman & Bostrom is the non-financial social & societal effects mentioned in their Table 3, where embryo selection can "perceptibly advantage a minority" or in an extreme case, "Selected dominate ranks of elite scientists, attorneys, physicians, engineers. Intellectual Renaissance?"
This is another point which is worth going into a little more; no specific calculations are mentioned by Shulman & Bostrom, and the thin-tail-effects of normal distributions are notoriously counterintuitive, with surprisingly large effects out on the tails from small-seeming changes in means or standard deviations - for example, the legendary levels of Western Jewish overperformance despite their tiny population sizes.

As a general rule of thumb, 'elite' groups like scientists, attorneys, physicians, Ivy League students etc are highly selected for intelligence - one can comfortably estimate averages >=130 IQ (+2SD) from past IQ samples & average SAT scores & the ever-increasingly stringent admissions; and elite performance continues to increase with increasing intelligence as high as can reasonably be measured, as indicated by available date like the SMPY longitudinal study (many papers but see [Wai et al 2005](http://tip.duke.edu/sites/default/files/Creativity%20and%20Occupational%20Accomplishments%20Among%20Intellectually%20Precocious%20Youths.pdf "Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study"), [Lubinski & Benbow 2006](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/DoingPsychScience20061.pdf "Study of mathematically precocious youth after 35 years: Uncovering antecedents for the development of math-science expertise"), [Park et al 2007](http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/ETD-db/available/etd-12062007-195216/unrestricted/01thesisES.pdf "Contrasting intellectual patterns predict creativity in the arts and sciences tracking intellectually precocious youth over 25 years"), [Wai et al 2009](http://tip.duke.edu/sites/default/files/Spatial%20Ability%20for%20STEM%20Domains.pdf "Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of Cumulative Psychological Knowledge Solidifies Its Importance"), [Kell et al 2013](/docs/iq/2013-kell.pdf "Who rises to the top? Early indicators")), where we might define the cut off as 160 IQ based on [Anne Roe](!Wikipedia)'s study of the most eminent available scientists (mean ~150-160).
So to estimate an impact, one could consider a question like: given an average boost of _x_ IQ points through embryo-selection, how much would the odds of being elite (>=130) or extremely elite (>=160) increase for the selected? If a certain fraction of IVFers were selected, what fraction of all people above the cutoff would they make up?

If there are 320 million people in the USA, then about 17m are +2SD and 43k are +3SD:

~~~{.R}
dnorm((130-100)/15) * 320000000
# [1] 17277109.28
dnorm((160-100)/15) * 320000000
# [1] 42825.67224
~~~

Similarly, in 2013, the [CDC reports](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/births.htm) 3,932,181 children born in the USA; and the 2013 CDC annual IVF report says that 67,996 (1.73%) were IVF.
This implies that IVFers also make up a very small number of highly gifted children:

~~~{.R}
size <- function(mean, cutoff, populationSize, useFraction=1) { if(cutoff>mean) { dnorm((cutoff-mean)/15) * populationSize * useFraction } else
                                                                 { (1 - dnorm((cutoff-mean)/15)) * populationSize * useFraction }}
size(100, 160, 67996)
# [1] 9.099920031
~~~

So assuming IVF parents average 100IQ, then we can take the embryo selection theoretical upper bound of +9.36 (+0.624SD) corresponding to the "aggressive IVF" set of scenarios in Table 3 of Shulman & Bostrom, and ask, if 100% of IVF children were selected, how many additional people over 160 would that create?

~~~{.R}
eliteGain <- function(ivfMean, ivfGain, ivfFraction, generation, cutoff, ivfPop, genMean, genPop) {

              ivfers      <- size(ivfMean,                      cutoff, ivfPop, 1)
              selected    <- size(ivfMean+(ivfGain*generation), cutoff, ivfPop, ivfFraction)
              nonSelected <- size(ivfMean,                      cutoff, ivfPop, 1-ivfFraction)
              gain        <- (selected+nonSelected) - ivfers

              population <- size(genMean, cutoff, genPop)
              multiplier <- gain / population
              return(multiplier) }
eliteGain(100, 9.36, 1, 1, 160, 67996, 100, 3932181)
# [1] 0.1554096565
~~~

In this example, the +0.624SD boosts the absolute number by 82 people, representing 15.5% of children passing the cutoff; this would mean that IVF overrepresentation would be noticeable if anyone went looking for it, but would not be a major issue nor even as noticeable as Jewish achievement. We would indeed see "Substantial growth in educational attainment, income", but we would not see much effect beyond that.

Is it realistic to assume that IVF children will be distributed around a mean of 100 sans any intervention? That seems unlikely, if only due to the substantial financial cost of using IVF; however, the existing literature is inconsistent, showing both higher & lower education or IQ scores ([Hart & Norman 2013](https://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/244.full "The longer-term health outcomes for children born as a result of IVF treatment. Part II - Mental health and development outcomes")), so perhaps the starting point really is 100.
The thin-tail effects make the starting mean extremely important; Shulman & Bostrom say, "*Second* generation manyfold increase at right tail."
Let's consider the second generation; with their post-selection mean IQ of 109.36, what second-generation is produced in the absence of outbreeding when they use IVF selection?

~~~{.R}
eliteGain(100, 9.36, 1, 2, 160, 67996, 100, 3932181)
# [1] 1.151238772
eliteGain(100, 9.36, 1, 5, 160, 67996, 100, 3932181)
# [1] 34.98100356
~~~

Now the IVF children represent a majority. With the third generation, they reach 5x; at the fourth, 17x; at the fifth, 35x; and so on.

In practice, of course, we currently would get much less: 0.13808892057 IQ points in the USA model, which would yield a trivial percentage increase of 0.06% or 1.6%:

~~~{.R}
eliteGain(100, 0.13808892057, 1, 1, 160, 67996, 100, 3932181)
# [1] 0.0006478714323
eliteGain(115, 0.13808892057, 1, 1, 160, 67996, 100, 3932181)
# [1] 0.01601047464
~~~

Table 3 considers 12 scenarios: 3 adoption fractions of the general population (100% IVFer/~0.25% general population, 10%, >90%) vs 4 average gains (4, 12, 19, 100+).
The descriptions add 2 additional variables: first vs second generation, and elite vs eminent, giving 48 relevant estimates total.

For many of the scenarios, the impact is not blatant until a second generation builds on the first, but the cumulative effect has an impact - one of the weakest scenarios, +4 IQ/10% adoption can still be seen at the second generation because easier to spot effects on the most elite levels; in another example, a boost of 12 points is noticeable in a single generation with as little as 10% of the general population adoption.
A boost of 19 points is visible in a fair number of scenarios, and a boost of 100 is visible at almost any adoption rate/generation/elite-level.
(Indeed, a boost of 100 results in almost meaninglessly large numbers under many scenarios; it's difficult to imagine a society with 100x as many geniuses running around, so it's even more difficult to imagine what it would mean for there to be 6,724x as many other than many things will start changing extremely rapidly in unpredictable ways.)

## Cost-benefit

As written, the IVF simulator cannot deliver a cost-benefit because the costs will depend on the internal state, like how many good embryos were created or the fact that a cycle ending in no live births will still incur costs, and report the marginal gain now that we're going case by case.
So it must be augmented:

~~~{.R}
simulateIVFCB <- function (eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP=0.5, vitrificationP, liveBirth, fixedCost, embryoCost, iqValue) {
  eggsExtracted <- max(0, round(rnorm(n=1, mean=eggMean, sd=eggSD)))

  normal        <- rbinom(1, eggsExtracted, prob=normalityP)

  totalCost     <- fixedCost + normal * embryoCost
  scores        <- embryoIQScores(n=normal, variance=polygenicScoreVariance)

  survived      <- Filter(function(x){rbinom(1, 1, prob=vitrificationP)}, scores)

  selection <- sort(survived, decreasing=FALSE)
  live <- 0
  gain <- 0

  if (length(selection)>0) {
   for (embryo in 1:length(selection)) {
    if (rbinom(1, 1, prob=liveBirth) == 1) {
      live <- selection[embryo]
      }
   }
  gain <- max(0, live - mean(selection))
  }
  return(data.frame(IQ=gain, Cost=totalCost, Net=(iqValue*gain - totalCost)))  }
library(plyr)
simulateIVFCBs <- function(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth, fixedCost, embryoCost, iqValue, iters=10000) {
  ldply(replicate(simplify=FALSE, iters, simulateIVFCB(eggMean, eggSD, polygenicScoreVariance, normalityP, vitrificationP, liveBirth, fixedCost, embryoCost, iqValue))) }
~~~

Now we have all our parameters set:

1. IQ's value is \$2,783 - \$13,744
2. The fixed cost of selection is \$1500
3. per-embryo cost of selection is \$200
4. and the relevant probabilities have been defined already

In general, embryo selection as of January 2016 is just barely profitable or somewhat unprofitable in each group using the lowest estimate of IQ's value; it is always profitable on average with the highest estimate.

### Value of Information

To get an idea of the value of further research into improving the polygenic score or other parts of the procedure, we can look at the overall population gains in the USA if it was adopted by all IVF users.
Using the high estimate of an average gain of \$3772, and noting that there were 67,996 IVF babies in 2013, that suggests an annual gain of up to \$256.5m.
What is the net present value of an annual gain of \$256.5m? Discounted at 5%, it'd be \$5.256b.

We might also ask: as an upper bound, in the realistic USA IVF model, how much would a perfect SNP polygenic score be worth?

Thus the expected value of perfect information here would be something like \$27.6b annually
How much would it cost to gain perfect information? [Hsu 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3421 "On the genetic architecture of intelligence and other quantitative traits") argues that a sample around 1 million would suffice with appropriate analysis; the largest usable^[23andMe has a much larger sample with education phenotyping, _n_>700k, but has declined to use it.] sample I know of, SSGAC, is around _n_=300k, leaving 700k to go; with SNPs costing ~\$200, that implies that it would cost \$0.14b for perfect SNP information.
Hence, the expected value of information would then be ~\$27.4b

In the US population estimate with the lowest IQ estimate, embryo selection only reaches break-even once the variance explained increases by a factor of 2.1 to 5.25%.
How much more data is necessary? The Rietveld et al 2013 polygenic score was based on a discovery sample of _n_=101k, but due to diminishing returns, it would require more than 3x/303k.
In the supplementary materials (pg22-23), they offer a population genetics-based approximation of how much variance a given sample size & heritability will explain:

1. $M = \frac{2 \cdot N_e \cdot k \cdot l}{log(2 \cdot N_e \cdot l)}$;
    they state that $N_e = 10000; k = 22; l = 1.6$, so $M = \frac{2 \cdot 10000 \cdot 22 \cdot 1.6}{log(2 \cdot 10000 \cdot 1.6)}$ or _M_ = 67865.
2. $R^2 = \frac{\frac{N}{M} \cdot h^4}{\frac{N}{M} \cdot h^2 + 1}$
    For education (the phenotype variable targeted by the main GWAS, serving as a proxy for intelligence), they estimate _h_^2^=0.2, or _h_=0.447 (h^2^ here being the heritability capturable by their SNP arrays, so equivalent to $h^2_{SNP}$), so for their sample size of 100000, they would expect to explain `N=100000; h=sqrt(0.2); ((N / 67865) * h^4) / ((N/67865) * h^2 + 1) ~> 0.045` or 4.5% of variance while they got 2-3%, suggesting over-estimation.

    For intelligence, the GCTAs say that $h^2_{SNP} = 0.33$, so Rietveld et al 2013's 0.025 is equivalent to _n_=17000, while to boost it to 2.1x (0.0525) turns out to require _n_=40000 or 2.35x, suggesting that another Rietveld et al 2013-style education GWAS would be adequate once it reached  $n \geq 2.35 \cdot 101000=237350$.

Aside from regular embryo selection, Shulman & Bostrom note the possibility of "iterated embryo selection", where after the selection step, the highest-scoring embryo's cells are regressed back to stem cells, to be turned into fresh embryos which can again be sequenced & selected on, and so on for as many cycles as feasible.
The benefit here is that in exchange for the additional work, one can combine the effects of many generations of embryo selection to produce a live baby which is equivalent to selecting out of hundreds or thousands or millions of embryos.
(10 cycles is much more effective than selecting on, say, 10x the number of embryos because it acts like a ratchet: each new batch of embryos is distributed around the genetic mean of the previous iteration, not the *original* embryo, and so the 1 or 2 IQ points accumulate.)
As they summarize it:

> *Stem-cell derived gametes could produce much larger effects*: The effectiveness of embryo selection would be vastly increased if multiple generations of selection could be compressed into less than a human maturation period. This could be enabled by advances in an important complementary technology: the derivation of viable sperm and eggs from human embryonic stem cells. Such stem-cell derived gametes would enable iterated embryo selection (henceforth, IES):
>
> 1. Genotype and select a number of embryos that are higher in desired genetic characteristics;
> 2. Extract stem cells from those embryos and convert them to sperm and ova, maturing within 6 months or less ([Sparrow, 2013](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.674.771&rep=rep1&type=pdf "In vitro eugenics"));
> 3. Cross the new sperm and ova to produce embryos;
> 4. Repeat until large genetic changes have been accumulated.
>
> Iterated embryo selection has recently drawn attention from bioethics (Sparrow, 2013; see also Miller, 2012; Machine Intelligence Research Institute, 2009 [and [Suter 2015](https://jlb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/16/jlb.lsv057.full "In vitro gametogenesis: just another way to have a baby?")]) in light of rapid scientific progress. Since the [Hinxton Group (2008)](http://www.hinxtongroup.org/Consensus_HG08_FINAL.pdf "Consensus Statement: Science Ethics and Policy Challenges of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Gametes") predicted that human stem cell-derived gametes would be available within ten years, the techniques have been used to produce fertile offspring in mice, and gamete-like cells in humans. However, substantial scientific challenges remain in translating animal results to humans, and in avoiding epigenetic abnormalities in the stem cell lines. These challenges might delay human application '10 or even 50 years in the future' ([Cyranoski, 2013](http://fatstemserbia.brinkster.net/Library/Newspapers/Egg%20Engineers.pdf "Stem cells: Egg engineers")). Limitations on research in human embryos may lead to IES achieving major applications in commercial animal breeding before human reproduction. If IES becomes feasible, it would radically change the cost and effectiveness of enhancement through selection. After the fixed investment of IES, many embryos could be produced from the final generation, so that they could be provided to parents at low cost.

IES is interesting, but it suffers from two main problems as far as a cost-benefit evaluation goes:

1. application to human cells remains largely hypothetical, and it is difficult for any outsider to understand how effective current induced pluripotency methods for pluripotent stem cell-derived gametes are: how much will the mouse research transfer to human cells? How reliable is the induction? What might be the long-term effects - or in the case of iterating it, what may be the short-term effects? Is this 5 years or 20 years away from practicality? What does the process cost at the moment, and what sort of lower limit on materials & labor costs can we expect from a mature process?
2. IES is inherently based on embryo selection and suffers from the weaknesses of embryo selection. Presumably the additional steps of inducing pluripotency and re-fertilizing will be complicated & very expensive (especially given that the proposed timelines for a single cycle run 4-6 *months*) compared to a routine sequencing & implantation, and this makes the costs explode: if the iteration costs \$10k extra per cycle and each cycle of embryo selection is only gaining ~1.13 IQ points due to the inherent weakness of polygenic scores, then each cycle may well be a loss, and the entire process colossally expensive. (If one is already spending \$10k on IVF and the SNP sequencing for each embryo costs \$100 then to get a respectable amount like 1 standard deviation through IES requires `(15/1.13) * (100+10000) + 10000 ~> 144070.7965`, which at almost \$9k a point is far beyond the ability to pay of almost everyone except multi-millionaires or governments who may have other reasons justifying use of the process.)

    There are some possible advantages to IES, though: eg it may reduce the need to extract eggs, or yield many more eggs (and hence embryos to select from). Whether any of these advantages materialize will depend sensitively on the development and costs of stem-cell derived gametes.

So it's difficult to see when IES will ever be practical or cost-effective.

# Embryo editing

One approach not discussed in Shulman & Bostrom is embryo editing, which has compelling advantages over selection:

1. Embryo selection must be done collectively for any meaningful gains, so one must score all viable embryos; while editing can potentially be done singly, editing only the embryo being implanted, and no more if that embryo yields a birth.
2/ Further, a failed implantation is a disaster for embryo selection, since it means one must settle for a possibly much lower scoring embryo with little or no gain while still having paid upfront for selection; on the other hand, the edit gains will be largely uniform across all embryos and so the loss of the first embryo is unfortunate (since it means another set of edits and an implantation will be necessary) but not a major setback.
3. Embryo selection suffers from the curse of thin tails and being unable to start from a higher mean (except as part of a multi-generational scheme): one takes 2 steps back for every 3 steps forward, so for larger gains, one must brute-force them with a steeply escalating number of embryos.
4. Embryo selection is constrained by the broad-sense heritability, and the number of available embryos.

    - No matter how many GWASes are done on whole-genomes or fancy algorithms are applied, embryo selection will never surpass the upper bound set by a broad-sense heritability 0.8; while the effects of editing has no known upper bound either in terms of existing population variation, as there appear to be thousands of variants inclusive of all genetic changes, and evolutionarily novel changes could theoretically be made as well^[Although it is hard to imagine any parent authorizing the creation of never-before-seen mutations in their child, regardless of how compelling a neurobiological mechanistic case is made for it. In comparison, switching SNPs is knowably safe because they all exist in the human population at high frequencies and can be observed to correlate or not with health problems. Animal experiments can help but inherently are unrepresentative of effects in humans, so the first child will still be subject to an unknown and probably large risk.] (a bacteria or a chimpanzee is, after all, not simply a small human who refuses to talk).
    - Editing is also largely independent of the number of embryos, since each embryo can be edited about as much as any other, and as long as one has enough embryos to expect a birth, more embryos make no difference.
5. Editing scales linearly and smoothly by going to the root of the problem, rather than difficulty increasing exponentially in gain - an example:

    as calculated above, the Rietveld et al 2013 polygenic score can yield a gain no greater than 2.58 IQ points with 1-in-10 selection, and in practice, we can hardly expect more than 0.14-0.56 IQ points in practice due to fewer than 10 embryos usually being viable etc.
    But with editing, we can do better: the same study reported 3 SNP hits (rs9320913, rs11584700, rs4851266) each predicting +1 month of schooling, the largest effects translating to ~0.5IQ points (the education proxy makes the exact value a little tricky but we can cross-check with other GWASes which regressed directly on fluid intelligence, like Davies et al 2015's whose largest hit, rs10457441, does indeed have a reported beta of -0.0324SD or -0.486) with fairly even balanced frequencies around 50% as well.^[Indeed, most of the reported hits have balanced frequencies. I haven't seen anyone specifically mention why this is so. My best guess is that it's the same reason we expect to see SNPs with the largest effects detected first: it's due to [statistical power](!Wikipedia). Imbalanced reduces power since the smaller group has larger standard errors; hence, if there are two SNPs with the same effect, but one has a frequency of 10% (with 90% of people having the bad variant) and another has an even 50-50 split, the second will be detected earlier by GWASes. This seems more sensible than expecting some force like [balancing selection](!Wikipedia) to be operating on most IQ-related SNPs.]
    So one can see immediately that if an embryo is sequenced & found to have the bad variant on any of those SNPs, a *single* edit has the same gain as the entire embryo selection process!
    Unlike embryo selection, there is no inherent reason an editing process must stop at one edit - and with two edits, one doesn't even need to sequence in the first place, as the frequency means that the expected value of editing the SNP is 0.25 points and so two *blind* edits would have the same gain!
    Continuing, the gains can stack; taking the 15 top hits from Davies et al 2015's [Supplementary Table S3](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v20/n2/extref/mp2014188x3.xlsx), 15 edits would yield 6.35 points and yes, combined with the next 15 after that would yield ~14 points, blowing past the SNP embryo selection upper bounds.
    While on average any embryo would not need half of those edits, that just means that an editing procedure will go down another entry down the list and edit that instead (given a budget of 15 edits, one might wind up editing, say #30). Since the estimated effects do not decline too fast and frequencies are high, this is similar to if we skipped every other edit and so the gains are still substantial:

    ~~~
6. Editing can be done on low-frequency or rare variants, whose effects are known but will not be available in the embryos in most selection instances.

    For example, sleep duration, quality, morningness-eveningness, and resistance to sleep deprivation ([Kuna et al 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3413799/ "Heritability of Performance Deficit Accumulation During Acute Sleep Deprivation in Twins")) are, like most traits, heritable. The extreme case is that of "short-sleepers", the ~1% of the population who normally sleep 3-6h; they often mention a parent who was also a short-sleeper, short sleep starting in childhood, that 'over' sleeping [is](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3kj669/science_ama_series_im_yinghui_fu_i_study_the/cuy7fjh) [unpleasant](!Wikipedia "Sleep inertia") & they do not fall asleep faster & don't sleep excessively more on weekends (indicating they are not merely chronically sleep-deprived), and are anecdotally described as [highly energetic](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/02/what-its-like-to-need-hardly-any-sleep.html "What It's Like to Need Hardly Any Sleep 'I get three or four hours sleep a night, and I never get tired.'") [multi-taskers,](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703712504576242701752957910 "The Sleepless Elite: Why Some People Can Run on Little Sleep and Get So Much Done") [thin,](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150706-the-woman-who-barely-sleeps "The people who need very little sleep: Is it true that some people need only a few hours of sleep? Helen Thomson talks to a woman whose genes might hint at how we all could survive on less shuteye") [with positive attitudes & high pain thresholds](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/16/135450214/eight-is-too-much-for-short-sleepers "Eight Is Too Much For 'Short Sleepers'") ([Monk et al 2001](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00254.x/full "A sleep diary and questionnaire study of naturally short sleepers")) without any known health effects or downsides in humans[^sleep-side-effects] or [mice](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3kj669/science_ama_series_im_yinghui_fu_i_study_the/cuy8cts) (aside from, presumably, greater caloric expenditure).

    Some instances of short-sleepers [are due to](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/a-gene-makes-you-need-less-sleep "A Gene That Makes You Need Less Sleep?") [DEC2](!Wikipedia "BHLHE41"), with a variant found in short-sleepers vs controls (6.25h vs 8.37h, -127m) and the effect confirmed by knockout-mice ([He et al 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884988/ "The Transcriptional Repressor DEC2 Regulates Sleep Length in Mammals")); another short-sleep variant was identified in a discordant twin pair with an effect of -64m ([Pellegrino et al 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096202/ "A Novel BHLHE41 Variant is Associated with Short Sleep and Resistance to Sleep Deprivation in Humans")). DEC2/BHLHE41 SNPs are also rare (for example, 3 such SNPs have frequencies of [0.08%](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?searchType=adhoc_search&type=rs&rs=rs4963956), [3%](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?searchType=adhoc_search&type=rs&rs=rs1480037), & [5%](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?searchType=adhoc_search&type=rs&rs=rs4963955)). Hence, selection would be almost entirely ineffective, but editing is easy.

    As far as costs and benefits go, we can observe that being able to stay awake an additional 127 minutes a day is equivalent to being able to live an additional 7 years, 191 minutes to 11 years; to negate that, any side-effect would have to be tantamount to lifelong smoking of tobacco.

[^sleep-side-effects]: This may seem contrary to the many reported correlations of morbidity & mortality with shiftwork/less self-reported sleep, or less resistance to infection, but those results are always driven by the general population suffering from insomnia, stress, disease, etc, and not by the tiny minority of short-sleepers. The short-sleepers themselves do not report greater vulnerability to infection or early mortality, and I don't believe any of the bad results focus on short-sleepers.

The largest disadvantage of editing, and the largest advantage of embryo selection, is that selection relies on proven, well-understood known-priced PGD technology already in use for other purposes; while the former hasn't existed and has been science fiction, not fact.

## CRISPR

The past 5 years have seen major breakthroughs in cheap, reliable, general-purpose genetic engineering & editing using [CRISPR](!Wikipedia), since the [2012 demonstration that it could edit cells](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816.long "'A Programmable Dual-RNA-Guided DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity', Jinek et al 2012"), including human ones ([Jinek et al 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557905/ "RNA-programmed genome editing in human cells")).^[Interestingly, this was not even the first application of CRISPR. That would appear to be [DuPont in 2007](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41676/title/There-s-CRISPR-in-Your-Yogurt/ "There's CRISPR in Your Yogurt: We've all been eating food enhanced by the genome-editing tool for years"), which began improved breeding of virus-resistant dairy cultures by introducing troublesome viral infections, and selecting for further use only those bacteria with changed CRISPR-related genomes, indicating they had acquired resistance to the virus.] Commentary in 2012 and 2013 regarded prospects for embyro editing as highly remote^[[November 2013](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/crispr-gene-therapy-scientists-call-for-more-public-debate-around-breakthrough-technique-8927606.html "CRISPR gene therapy: Scientists call for more public debate around breakthrough technique"): "'But it is far too early to contemplate using these methods to alter the human germline'...Professor Dagan Wells, an IVF researcher at Oxford University, said that although there is still a long way to go before CRISPR could even be considered for use on IVF embryos"] Even as late as July 2014, coverage was highly circumspect, with [vague musing](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/science/a-call-to-fight-malaria-one-mosquito-at-a-time-by-altering-dna.html "A Call to Fight Malaria One Mosquito at a Time by Altering DNA") that "Some experiments also hint that doctors may someday be able to use it to treat genetic disorders"; successful editing of zebrafish ([Hwang et al 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686313/ "Efficient In Vivo Genome Editing Using RNA-Guided Nucleases")), monkey, and human embryos was already being demonstrated in the lab, and human trials would begin 2-3 years later.
(Surprisingly, Shulman & Bostrom do *not* mention CRISPR, but that gives an idea of how shockingly fast CRISPR went from strange to news to standard, and how low expectations for genetic engineering were pre-2015 after decades of agonizingly slow progress & high-profile failures & deaths, such that the default assumption was that direct cheap safe genetic engineering of embryos would not be feasible for decades and certainly not the foreseeable future.)

The CRISPR/Cas system exploits a bacterial anti-viral immune system in which snippets of virus DNA are stored and an enzyme system detects the presence in the bacterial genome of fresh viral DNA and then edits it, breaking it, and presumably stopping the infection in its latent phase. This requires the CRISPR enzymes to be highly precise (lest it attack legitimate DNA, damaging or killing itself), repeatable (it's a poor immune system that can only fight off one infection ever), and programmable by short RNA sequences (because viruses constantly mutate).

This turns out to be usable in animal and human cells to delete/knock-out genes: create an RNA sequence matching a particular gene, inject the RNA sequence along with the key enzymes into a cell, and it will find the gene in question inside the nucleus and snip it; this can be augmented to edit rather than delete by providing another DNA template which the snip-repair mechanisms will unwittingly copy from.
Compared to the major earlier approaches using [zinc finger nuclease](!Wikipedia) & [TALENs](!Wikipedia "Transcription activator-like effector nuclease"), CRISPR is far faster and easier and cheaper to use, with large (at least halving) decreases in time & money cited, and use of it has exploded in research labs, drawing comparisons to the invention of PCR and Nobel Prize predictions.
It has been used to edit at least 36 creatures as of June 2015^[[_Nature_](http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673): "Jennifer Doudna, a CRISPR pioneer at the University of California, Berkeley, is keeping a list of CRISPR-altered creatures.

Estimating the profit from CRISPR edits is, in some ways, less straightforward than from embryo selection:

1. taking the highest _n_ reported betas/coefficients from a GWAS OLS regressions implies that they will be systematically biased upwards due to the winner's curse and statistical-significance filtering, thereby exaggerating the potential benefit from each SNP
2. the causal tagging problem: GWAS estimates correlating SNPs with phenotype traits, while valid for prediction (and hence selection), are not necessarily *causal* (such that an edit at that SNP will have the estimated effect), and the probability of being non-causal
3. each CRISPR edit has a chance of not making the correct edit, and making wrong edits; an edit may not work in an embryo (the specificity, false negative), and there is a chance of an 'off-target' mutation (false positive). A non-edit is a waste of money, while an off-target mutation could be fatal.
4. CRISPR has advanced at such a rapid rate that numbers on cost, specificity, & off-target mutation rate are generally either not available, or are arguably out of date before they were published^[For example, Liang et al 2015's reported off-target mutation numbers in human embryos was greeted with a comment from George Church that ["the researchers did not use the most up-to-date CRISPR/Cas9 methods and that many of the researchers' problems could have been avoided or lessened if they had."](http://www.nature.com/news/embryo-editing-sparks-epic-debate-1.17421 "Embryo editing sparks epic debate: In wake of paper describing genetic modification of human embryos, scientists disagree about ethics")]

The winner's curse can be dealt with several ways; [the supplementary of Rietveld et al 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183313/bin/pnas.1404623111.sapp.pdf) discusses 4 methods ("inverting the conditional expectation of the OLS estimator, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), Bayesian estimation, and empirical-Bayes estimation").
The best one for our purposes would be a Bayesian approach, yielding posterior distributions of effect sizes.
Unfortunately, the raw data for GWAS studies like Rietveld et al 2013 is not available; but for our purposes, we can, like in the Rietveld et al 2014 supplement, simply simulate a dataset and work with that to get posteriors to find the SNPs with unbiased largest posterior means.

The causal tagging problem is more difficult. The background for the causal tagging problem is that genes are recombined randomly at conception, but they are not recombined at the individual gene level; rather, genes tend to live in 'blocks' of contiguous genes called [haplotypes](!Wikipedia), leading to [linkage disequilibrium](!Wikipedia) (LD). Not every possible variant in a haplotype is detected by a SNP array chip, so if you have genes A/B/C/D, it may be the case that a variant of A will increase intelligence but your SNP array chip only detects variants of D; when you do a GWAS, you then discover D predicts increased intelligence. (And if your SNP array chip tags B or C, you may get hits on those as well!)
This is not a problem for embryo selection, because if you can only see D's variants, and you see that an embryo has the 'good' D variant, and you pick that embryo, it will indeed grow up as you hoped because that D variant pulled the true causal A variant along for the ride. Indeed, for selection or prediction, the causal tagging problem can be seen as a *good* thing: your GWASes can pick up effects from parts of the genome you didn't even pay to sequence - "buy one, get one free". (The downside can be underestimation due to imperfect proxies.)
But this is a problem for embryo editing because if a CRISPR enzyme goes in and carefully edits D while leaving everything untouched, A by definition remains the same and there will be no benefits.
A SNP being non-causal is not a serious problem for embryo editing if we know which SNPs are non-causal; as illustrated above, the distribution of effects is smooth enough that discarding a top SNP for the next best alternative costs little. But it is a serious problem if we don't know which ones are non-causal, because then we waste precious edits (imagine a budget of 30 edits and a non-causal rate of 50%; if we are ignorant which are non-causal, we effectively get only 15 edits, but if we know which to drop, then it's almost as good as if all were causal).
Causality can be established in a few ways; for example, a hit can be reused in a mutant laboratory animal breed to see if it also predicts there (This is behind some striking breakthroughs like [Sekar et al 2016](/docs/genetics/2016-sekar.pdf "Schizophrenia risk from complex variation of complement component 4")'s proof that neural pruning is a cause of schizophrenia), either using existing strains or creating a fresh modification (using, say, CRISPR). This has not been done for the top intelligence hits and given the expense & difficulty of animal experimentation, we can't expect it anytime soon. <!-- TODO: later on, estimate VoI for individual SNP confirmations -->
One can also try to use prior information to boost the posterior probability of an effect: if a gene has already been linked to the nervous system by previous studies exploring mutations or gene expression data etc, or other aspects of the physical structure point towards that SNP like being closest to a gene, then that is evidence for the association being causal. Intelligence hits are enriched for nervous system connections, but this method is inherently weak.
A better method is fine-mapping or whole-genome sequencing: when all the variants in a haplotype are sequenced, then the true causal variant will tend to perform subtly better and one can single it out of the whole SNP set. Useful, but whole-genomes are still expensive enough that they are not created nearly as much as SNPs.
Another approach is similar to the lab animal approach: human groups differ genetically, and their haplotypes & LD patterns can differ greatly; if D looks associated with intelligence in one group, but is not associated in a genetically distant group with different haplotypes, that strongly suggests that in the first group, D was indeed just proxying for another variant.
Some of the intelligence hits have replicated in European-American samples, as expected but not helpfully; more importantly, in African-American ([Domingue et al 2015](http://ero.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2332858415599972?full "Polygenic Influence on Educational Attainment")) and East Asian samples ([Zhu et al 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chuansheng_Chen/publication/265855103_Educational_attainment-related_loci_identified_by_GWAS_are_associated_with_select_personality_traits_and_mathematics_and_language_abilities/links/542af5720cf27e39fa917a84.pdf "Educational attainment-related loci identified by GWAS are associated with select personality traits and mathematics and language abilities")).
The example of the schizophrenia GWASes ([Candia et al 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000292971300325X "Additive Genetic Variation in Schizophrenia Risk Is Shared by Populations of African and European Descent"), [Ripke et al 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112379/ "Biological Insights From 108 Schizophrenia-Associated Genetic Loci")) also offers hope in showing a SNP correlation of 0.66/0.61 between African & European schizophrenia SNPs


Given the practice of embryo editing, the causal tagging problem can gradually solve itself: as edits are made, forcibly breaking the potential confounds, the causal nature of an SNP becomes clear. But how to allocate edits across the top SNPs to determine each's causal nature as efficiently as possible without spending too many edits investigating?
A naive answer might be something along the lines of a power analysis: in a two-group _t_-test trying to detect a difference of ~0.03 SD for each variant (the rough size of the top few variants), with variance reduced by the known polygenic score, and desired power is the standard 80%; it follows that one would need to randomize a total sample of _n_=34842 to reject the null hypothesis of 0 effect[^t-test-editing]. Setting up a [factorial experiment](!Wikipedia) & randomizing several variants simultaneously may allow inferences on them as well, but clearly this is going to be a tough row to hoe.
This is unduly pessimistic, since we neither need nor desire 80% power, nor are we comparing to a null hypothesis, as our goal is more modest: since only a certain number of edits will be doable for any embryo, say 30, we merely want to accumulate enough evidence about the top 30 variants to either demote it to #31 (and so we no longer spend any edits on it) or confirm it belongs in the top 30 and we should always be editing it.
This is immediately recognizable as [reinforcement learning](!Wikipedia): the [multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem](!Wikipedia "Multi-armed bandit") (each possible edit being an independent arm which can pulled or not); or more precisely, since early childhood (5yo) IQ scores are relatively poorly correlated with adult scores ([_r_=0.55](http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/08/predictive-power-of-early-childhood-iq.html)) and many embryos may be edited before data on the first edits starts coming in, a multi-armed bandit with multiple plays and delayed feedback.
[Thompson sampling](!Wikipedia) is a randomized Bayesian approach which is simple and theoretically optimal, with excellent performance in practice as well; an [extension to multiple plays](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00779 "'Optimal Regret Analysis of Thompson Sampling in Stochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problem with Multiple Plays', Komiyama et al 2015") is also optimal.
Dealing with the delayed feedback is known to be difficult and multiple play Thompson sampling may not be optimal, but in simulations it [performs better with delayed feedback than other standard MABs](http://www.research.rutgers.edu/~lihong/pub/Chapelle12Empirical.pdf "'An Empirical Evaluation of Thompson Sampling', Chapelle & Li 2011").
We can consider a simulation of the scenario in which every time-step is a day and 1 or more embryos must be edited that day; a noisy measure of IQ is then made available `9*31+5*365=2104` days later. (So for the first 2104 time-steps, a Thompson sample would be performed to yield a new set of edits, then each subsequent time-step a datapoint would mature, the posteriors updated, and another set of edits created.) The relevant question is how much regret will fall and how many causal SNPs become the top picks after how many edits & days: hopefully high performance & low regret will be achieved within a few years after the initial 5-year delay.

problem: what's the probability of non-causal tagging due to LD? probably low since they work cross-racially don't they? on the other hand: http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=5415
"If the GWAS SNPs owe their predictive power to being actual causal variants, then LD is irrelevant and they should predict the relevant outcome in any racial group. If however they owe wholly or partly their predictive power to just being statistically related to causal variants, they should be relatively worse predictors in racial groups that are most distantly related. One can investigate this by comparing the predictive power of GWAS betas derived from one population on another population. Since there are by now 1000s of GWAS, meta-analyses have in fact made such comparisons, mostly for disease traits. Two reviews found substantial cross-validity for the Eurasian population (Europeans and East Asians), and less for Africans (usually African Americans) (23,24). The first review only relied on SNPs with p<α and found weaker results. This is expected because using only these is a threshold effect, as discussed earlier.

The second review (from 2013; 299 included GWAS) found much stronger results, probably because it included more SNPs and because they also adjusted for statistical power. Doing so, they found that: ~100% of SNPs replicate in other European samples when accounting for statistical power, ~80% in East Asian samples but only ~10% in the African American sample (not adjusted for statistical power, which was ~60% on average). There were fairly few GWAS for AAs however, so some caution is needed in interpreting the number. Still, this throws some doubt on the usefulness of GWAS results from Europeans or Asians used on African samples (or reversely)."

Also, what about mosaicism? When the CRISPR RNA is injected into an even single-celled zygote, it may already have created some of the DNA for a split and so the edit covers only a fraction of the cells of the future full-grown organism.
"Additionally, editing may happen after first embryonic division, due to persistence of Cas9:gRNA complexes, also causing mosaicism. We (unpublished results) and others (Yang et al. 2013a; Ma et al. 2014; Yen et al. 2014) have observed mosaic animals carrying three or more alleles. A recent study reported surprisingly high percentage of mosaic mice (up to 80%) generated by CRISPR targeting of the tyrosinase gene (Tyr) (Yen et al. 2014). We have observed a varying frequency of mosaicism, 11-35%, depending on the gene/locus (our unpublished data)... The pronuclear microinjection of gRNA and Cas9, in a manner essentially identical to what is used for generating transgenic mice, can be easily adapted by most transgenic facilities. Facilities equipped with a Piezo-electric micromanipulator can opt for cytoplasmic injections as reported (Wang et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013a). Horii et al. (2014) performed an extensive comparison study suggesting that cytoplasmic injection of a gRNA and Cas9 mRNA mixture as the best delivery method. Although the overall editing efficiency in born pups yielded by pronuclear vs. cytoplasmic RNA injection seems to be comparable (Table 1), the latter method generated two- to fourfold more live born pups. Injection of plasmid DNA carrying Cas9 and gRNA to the pronucleus was the least efficient method in terms of survival and targeting efficiency (Mashiko et al. 2013; Horii et al. 2014). Injection into pronuclei seems to be more damaging to embryos than injection of the same volume or concentration of editing reagents to the cytoplasm. It has been shown that cytoplasmic injection of Cas9 mRNA at concentrations up to 200 ng/μl is not toxic to embryos (Wang et al. 2013) and efficient editing was achieved at concentrations as low as 1.5 ng/μl (Ran et al. 2013a). In our hands, injecting Cas9 mRNA at 50-150 ng/μl and gRNA at 50-75 ng/μl first into the pronucleus and also into the cytoplasm as the needle is being withdrawn, yields good survival of embryos and efficient editing by NHEJ in live born pups (our unpublished observations)." http://genetics.org/content/199/1/1.full

13:16:15 <@gwern> hm. there are ~50k ivf babies each year in the USA. my quick CRISPR sketch suggested that for a few mill you could get up to 150-170. `dnorm((150-100)/15) * 320000000 ~>

> "To confirm these GUIDE-seq findings, we used targeted amplicon sequencing to more directly measure the frequencies of indel mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 and SpCas9-HF1. For these experiments, we transfected human cells only with sgRNA- and Cas9encoding plasmids (without the GUIDE-seq tag). We used next-generation sequencing to examine the on-target sites and 36 of the 40 off-target sites that had been identified for six sgRNAs with wild-type SpCas9 in our GUIDE-seq experiments (four of the 40 sites could not be specifically amplified from genomic DNA). These deep sequencing experiments showed that: (1) wild-type SpCas9 and SpCas9-HF1 induced comparable frequencies of indels at each of the six sgRNA on-target sites, indicating that the nucleases and sgRNAs were functional in all experimental replicates (Fig. 3a, b); (2) as expected, wild-type SpCas9 showed statistically significant evidence of indel mutations at 35 of the 36 off-target sites (Fig. 3b) at frequencies that correlated well with GUIDE-seq read counts for these same sites (Fig. 3c); and (3) the frequencies of indels induced by SpCas9-HF1 at 34 of the 36 off-target sites were statistically indistinguishable from the background level of indels observed in samples from control transfections (Fig. 3b). For the two off-target sites that appeared to have statistically significant mutation frequencies with SpCas9-HF1 relative to the negative control, the mean frequencies of indels were 0.049% and 0.037%, levels at which it is difficult to determine whether these are due to sequencing or PCR error or are bona fide nuclease-induced indels. Based on these results, we conclude that SpCas9-HF1 can completely or nearly completely reduce off-target mutations that occur across a range of different frequencies with wild-type SpCas9 to levels generally undetectable by GUIDE-seq and targeted deep sequencing."

So no detected off-target mutations down to the level of lab error rate detectability. Amazing. So you can do a CRISPR on a cell with a >75% chance of making the edit to a desired gene correctly, and a <0.05% chance of a mistaken (potentially harmless) edit/mutation on a similar gene. With an error rate that low, you could do hundreds of CRISPR edits to a set of embryos with a low net risk of error... The median number of eggs extracted from a woman during IVF in America is ~9; assume the worst case of 0.05% risk of off-target mutation and that one scraps any embryo found to have any mutation at all even if it looks harmless; then the probability of making 1000 edits without an off-target mutation could be (1-(0.05/100)) ^ 1000 = 60%, so you're left with 5.4 good embryos, which is a decent yield. Making an edit of the top 1000 betas from the Rietveld 2013 polygenic score and figuring that it's weakened by maybe 25% due to particular cells not getting particular edits and that is... a very large number.

When I was doing my dysgenics analysis, I found that the Rietveld betas could be reasonably approximated by `rexp`, and we can anchor it by assuming the biggest effect is 0.5 IQ points, so we divide by 18, in which case we might estimate the top 750 edits at a cumulative value of `sum(sort((rexp(10000)/1)/18, decreasing=TRUE)[1:750] * 0.5) ~> [1] 73.97740467`. (Caveats: assumes knowledge of true betas, needs to be weakened for actual posterior probabilities, etc etc.)

How much did that <74 IQ points cost? Well, I hear that TALENS in bulk costs $500 so you could ballpark marginal costs of particular CRISPR edits at that much too (and hopefully much less), and whole-genomes still cost $1k, and you need to do 1000 edits on each embryo and whole-genomes at the end to check for off-target mutations, so you could ballpark a full suite of edits to 10 embryos at ~$5m: `10*1000 + 10 * 1000 * 500 ~> [1] 5010000`. Of them 40% will have an off-target mutation, so you get 6 embryos to implant at a success rate of ~20% each which gives you about even odds for a healthy live birth, so you need to double the $5m.

'Jennifer Doudna, one of the co-discoverers of CRISPR, told MIT Tech Review's Antonio Regalado just how easy it was to work with the tool: "Any scientist with molecular biology skills and knowledge of how to work with [embryos] is going to be able to do this." Harvard geneticist George Church, whose lab is doing some of the premier research on CRISPR, says: "You could conceivably set up a CRISPR lab for $2000."' http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-genetically-modify-human-embryos-2015-4
"Democratizing genetic engineering: This one should keep you up at night. CRISPR is so accessible-you can order the components online for $60-that it is putting the power of genetic engineering into the hands of many more scientists. But the next wave of users could be at-home hobbyists. This year, developers of a do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit began offering it for $700, less than the price of some computers. The trend might lead to an explosion of innovation-or to dangerous, uncontrolled experiments by newbies. Watch out, world.
