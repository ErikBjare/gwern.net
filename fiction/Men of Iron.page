On the last day, the aliens took the iron. They settled in a polar orbit, and slowly stripped the world; satellites were the first to go, in a spreading zone of ignorance which satellites entered and then did not return from. The mystified operators communicated and some turned their satellites around to scan the skies, as did those "intelligence assets" which had not used up too much fuel in station-keeping. The slowly expanding silver lozenges were spotted very quickly (to little avail but fostering debates among academics in the ruins).

The effects were peculiarly limited. That any human or living creature survived indicated that the removal of iron was limited to non-organic creatures: had iron been removed from hemoglobin and the oxygen content of blood reduced to zero, all would have asphyxiated in a minute or less. Miners reported that no iron seams were accessible in existing mines, but the iron-rich core of the Earth could not have been removed as the crust had not collapsed, the Earth's orbit seemed to be unchanged, and the magnetic field retained its usual strength. Naked-eye observations ruled out the possibility that the core had been removed from Venus or Mars, and Mars retained its red color, but the margins of error too large to rule out orbital aberrations due to hypothetical removal of gigatons of iron from the subsurface of either.

The reason for the aliens doing this was not clear. Unknown physics was involved, as no mechanism could even be hypothesized. A flotilla of vessels spoke of a rich interstellar civilization, which was impossible without millennia of peace and cooperation, but their actions supported the "intelligence implies belligerence" thesis: humanity had stored up so much data in digital libraries, often routed through communication satellites, that it was impossible that the aliens could not communicate, and yet they would not, they communicated neither demands nor warning nor explanation. Perhaps they were doing precisely what it looked like - mining for producing allotropic iron? But why mine in such a destructive method, and why choose the Earth rather than any of the other rocky iron-rich planets, or better yet, the asteroids? (One astronomer noted that with the end of certain programs, it was possible that the asteroids had been mined out already but we had not seen it.)

Iron, humanity was forcibly reminded, was crucial to almost all enterprises, in any of its derivatives such as steel. A proud column of steel, deprived of iron, is but a mist of chromium and other adulterants which supports nothing. As the absence crept along the globe, it was followed by darkness and large red pinpricks of light.

In the former Tokyo, the most elderly looked at the rubble piles and fires with surprising equanimity: the world had already ended for them once. In China, the dreams of the restored Middle Kingdom collapsed with Beijing and Shanghai. Ankara experienced the earthquake long warned of by Christian scientists; as everywhere, they cursed God in their own way. In New York, fear of terrorism gripped the subconscious, and dozens of thousands died as the bridges disappeared. In San Francisco, the buildings - reinforced against earthquake and kept close to the ground by rent-seeking regulation - killed fewer hundreds of thousands than one would have expected; the irony was not noted.

Microchips, it turned out, were often exempt from the effect; some manufacturers used iron in key roles, but others had moved away from metals as much as possible. Much of the surviving computing infrastructure was destroyed by collapsing buildings, firestorms, or simply disabled by lack of power from generators that were little more than loops of copper wire sitting in puddles of gasoline. But many places simply worked fine. The world split between dark and light.

Remaining centers of industrialization reached a consensus that civilization could be rebuilt on the remaining non-ferrous metals and alloys, like aluminum. Bauxite purification requires megawatts of electricity and ore from Africa. It was realized that smelting plants in Iceland depended on dams broken by the event, and that with the sinking of most modern vessels, there was no way to transport the ore there. The remaining vessels were backlogged for years on humanitarian grounds. Hobbyists were consulted on wooden sailing ships.

Crops withered and rotted in the fields of developed nations as the built-up capital of industrialization was set back at a stroke to the 1500s (and the Warring States period in China), with iron or steel plows now useless. The 1% of the population could no longer feed the 99%; the masses fled the dying cities to the fields. One way or another, the problem would be solved. People in the poorest countries began killing each other; the situation is indistinguishable from before.

Menstrual blood contains ~0.7mg of iron per day. A human body contains 1-4 grams of iron. The mining of iron resumed.

The existing crops were harvested without more issues than might be expected at the end of the world. The specter of iron chlorosis stalked the land. The next crop was small and sick, with pale yellow leaves. Yields were a tenth or less of projected. Food insecurity, already extraordinarily high, became higher. Large regions are denuded of any chlorophyllic life. Rich people lamented the extinction of pears and raspberries.

The food yields were the first blow. With foodstuffs deficient in iron, people began to lose their own iron. The next generation of children grew up stunted, apathetic, and less intelligent than their parents. Iodized salt was a luxury of the past. Females were overrepresented among the goiterous cretins, and menstruating women were most hard struck by anemia. Sexism swelled based on simple observation.

As the catastrophe continued to ramify, additional speculation was added to the journals: perhaps the removal of iron was simply a way of neutering a planet permanently. Without iron ore and with hydrocarbon reserves depleted, it would be impossible to ever develop again. This explanation seemed as plausible as any.
