When I was a high-schooler, I greatly enjoyed [Ryan North](!Wikipedia)'s _[Dinosaur Comics](!Wikipedia)_; I was impressed by how much he could do within the strict limit of his template, and I tried my hand at a few comics. Re-reading them, I wish I had been more careful about the spelling & formatting, but they hold up better than most of my juvenilia.

## Poetry

The haiku:

    Blue can of steel
    What promise do you hold?
    Salt flesh so ripe

    Little slab of meat!
    In a wash of clear jelly;
    Now I heat the pan

    In the cool morning
    I fry up a slab of SPAM -
    A dog barks next door.

    Ears, snouts, and innards
    A homogenous mess.
    Pass another slice!

    Highly unnatural
    The tortured shape of this "food"
    A small pink coffin

    Slicing your sweet self
    salivating in suspense -
    Sizzle... Sizzle... Spam!

    Pink beefy temptress -
    I can no longer remain
    Vegetarian.

    Staunch defenders we,
    Poetic conoisseurs of the
    True deliciousness
