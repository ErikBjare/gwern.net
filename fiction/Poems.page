Verses composed on particular occasions:

# Spring

    None remain to see,
    under pouring skies, the first
    strawberry ripen

    Long after petting
    the armies of black insects
    march across the floor
    as my cat wages fierce war
    for hours on clumps of fur

    With a sudden swear
    lifting my tea mug; for there
    - even more cat hair!

    The sun will rise, yes,
    but the mayflies live today;
    cold comfort is it
    the storm may fly tomorrow
    and the sun will rise again

Idling in the grass tracing out paths in the dirt for ants, when I should be studying French, I mistranslated the following poem:

    Petit Jesus
    petit agneau
    fait mon coeur
    un berceau

    Petite, J'ai su
    Petite ameau
    Fait mon cours
    un bearow

    Little, I know, but
    my small friend, travel my road
    for just a while

# Summer

    Down on the grasses,
    I gaze at the summer sun -
    And it gazes back!

    The party over
    beer bottles and fireflies
    duet in twilight

    Our revels over,
    gleaming bottles remain;
    and beneath full moons,
    the summer fireflies dance -
    flaring, sparkling, redoubled

# Autumn

    With the autumn sun
    my birthday comes, and it goes;
    and the leftover
    presents' discarded wrappings
    remind me of my own fate.

    Death poems are all just
    falling blossoms and nonsense:
    dying is dying

    What zeal!
    the wild nights spent burning
    candles,
    running up mountains,
    churning through paper

Reply:

    With such zeal and joy
    did I burn those wild nights
    in the candle light,
    bounding up paper piles
    and scaling mountains of thought

Coda:

    Now decade the third,
    and what do I have to show?
    A pile of words
    whose value I do not know;
    and the cold autumn winds blow

    "Where has the time gone?"
    I wonder in my study,
    rain on the windows -
    and the years drip down on me
    as yellowed papers

# Winter

    With the melting frost,
    this winter my dog departs.
    Only snow returns
    again and again; and we
    too must vanish like the dew.

    Our lives are rivers
    that endlessly flow into
    quiet seas of death
