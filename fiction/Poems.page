# Spring

    None remain to see,
    under pouring skies, the first
    strawberry ripen

concept: so many tufts of / black fur have I petted off my cat / that he chases and pounces on them / like an army of insects / marching across the floor

so long have we played
that my cat's lost tufts of fur
march across the floor:
an army of black insects
for him to chase and pounce on

long after petting
an army of black insects
march across the floor
and my cat wages war for
hours against his clumps of fur

my cat pounces on
the army of black insects
marching across the floor;
but does he recall when I
brushed all that fur off of him?


    With a sudden swear
    lifting my tea mug; for there
    - even more cat hair!

# Summer

    the party over
    beer bottles and fireflies
    duet in twilight

    our revels over,
    gleaming bottles remain;
    and beneath full moons,
    the summer fireflies dance -
    flaring, sparkling, redoubled

    Down on the grasses,
    I gaze at the summer sun -
    And it gazes back!

# Autumn

    With the autumn sun
    my birthday comes, and it goes;
    and the leftover
    presents' discarded wrappings
    remind me of my own fate.

    Death poems are all just
    falling blossoms and nonsense:
    dying is dying

Papermachine:

    What zeal!
    the wild nights spent burning
    candles,
    running up mountains,
    churning through paper.

Reply:

    With such zeal and joy
    did I burn those wild nights
    in the candle light,
    bounding up paper piles
    and scaling mountains of thought

Coda:

    "Where has the time gone?"
    I wonder in my study,
    rain on the windows -
    and the years drip down on me
    as yellowed papers.

# Winter

    With the melting frost,
    this winter my dog departs.
    Only snow returns
    again and again; and we
    too must vanish like the dew.

    Our lives are rivers
    that endlessly flow into
    quiet seas of death
