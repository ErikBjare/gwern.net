...

    Do not ask the price that we paid
    nor the burdens that we endured;
    but take the world that we have made
    and be happy forevermore.

    For you, cold winds no longer blow,
    forgotten are the childrens' screams,
    so there is nothing you should know
    - let it all fade, as in a dream.

    Nature, red in tooth and claw,
    crushed all in its gaping maw.
    Suffering for all the law,
    and pain without end we saw.

    War and holocaust, rape and death,
    cancer and decay, death and greed;
    we fought them to our dying breath
    that such should never again be.

    The horrors that I could tell you:
    of gas chambers and the chosen
    of slow disease, nothing to do
    of fire, and nails into eyes -

    No. I will not tell mankind's tale.
    How could you live with such darkness?
    To know we built with bloody nails?
    That billions in graves do not rest?

    So do not ask the prices paid
    nor what the burdens we endured;
    but rejoice in the world we made.
    Please be happy, forevermore.
