# Submissions

Question: is submitting to HN worthwhile?

Simple experiment: submit each day one link to gwern.net + 2 links to other domains. These serve as both a rough control for that day's difficulty of front page, any benefits or penalties applied to my account, and repayment to HN for the potential spamming.

per nathanael's post, I tried to consistently post around 10AM EST (I don't get up early enough to do 7-8AM EST). Apparently he's wrong? Oh well.

multi-level Poisson model? Group by Domain and cross group by Day. mixture model? seems appropriate for two different groups (those who make front page and those who don't)

# /newest

> The social news service Hacker News has a two-layered organization, where newly submitted links are displayed on a '/newest' page seen by few users, and the best (as determined by users voting on each submission) are automatically selected for display on the high-traffic main front-page which most HN users read.
> I hypothesized that there is a lack of traffic on /newest and this implies that even one vote can substantially affect the chance a particular submission will reach the front-page, its ultimate score, and page-views of the submitted link.
> A randomized experiment in upvoting small batches of links confirms that the effect is real & large: TODO.

While using HN, as a sort of 'public service', I occasionally made sure to visit the [newest submissions](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest "New Links") page rather than just the [main front page](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) most people read.
After a while, I noticed that the links I upvoted there seemed to be turning up a lot on the front page, more than I would expect from my usual pattern of upvoting perhaps 5 links out of the 30 available.
A horrible suspicion struck me: could the apparent arbitrariness of what links made the front page be caused by the /newest page being *so* sparsely voted upon that a single upvote made a meaningful difference?

## Methodology

I decided to do a randomized parallel groups experiment to test:
On /newest, take the first 5 links (#1-5, to maximize impact), do a simple 50-50 randomization on each to decide whether to upvote or ignore (I have a shell function for randomization: `echo "$((RANDOM % 2 < 1))"`);
and make no votes on any other /newest items (I allowed myself my usual browsing & upvoting on the main page while I was there).
As I have 'noprocast' turned on for 180 minutes, each group of 5 links should have been separated by a minimum of 3 hours (more than enough time for all links to fall off /newest).
This was typically done during HN's busiest hours: 11AM-midnight EST.
I was not blinded during the experiment, but the writeup & list were never public while the experiment was running.
I used my existing high-karma (>7k) account since there doesn't seem to be any weighting of upvotes, reading through ["Inside the news.yc ranking formula"](http://www.righto.com/2009/06/how-does-newsyc-ranking-work.html), ["How Hacker News ranking algorithm works"](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19574) & [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1781013).

A power calculation for sample size is hard to do: I don't have a Poisson power function handy, and I don't expect the data to fit a Poisson too well due to the stark contrast between the front-page and /newest.
(And I do want a well-powered experiment - the only thing more wasteful than an overpowered experiment is an underpowered weak experiment.)
However, I do expect the necessary sample to be quite large by the standards of continuous normally-distributed data.
Most submissions to /newest fail to gain more than an upvote or two, which means that most of the sample contains little information about whether the extra upvote helped them reach the front-page or not.
Further, I don't just want to estimate whether the net effect of upvoting is >1, I would like a reasonably precise estimate of *what* the effect is: knowing that it's, say, +2-10, is not very satisfactory. ("The oncoming car is somewhere between 10 meters and a kilometer away.")
All in all, I don't expect the necessary _n_ to be <200.
I decided to stop at _n_=300.

The experiment ran from 16 March 2014 - TODO March 2014.

## Analysis plan

The analysis strategy is:

1. a non-parametric test of difference in mean scores
2. dichotomize the items by <10 as a proxy for having made it to the front-page for a meaningful amount of time, for a [logistic regression](!Wikipedia) to estimate increase in front-page odds
3. attempt a Poisson regression on scores, to extract an estimate of the difference in means
4. something fancier, suggested by the data (such as a [mixture model](!Wikipedia) of Poissons, perhaps, to split between front-page and non-front-page)

TODO: extract page views & time on page from my old Analytics, letting me calculate 'how much time am I steering with, say, 10 upvotes on /newest?'

The 2 groups are not exactly balanced due to the simple randomization.
The _n_ should be divisible by 5, but is off by TODO 1; I think I must have failed to copy-paste one link at some point.

~~~

Note that the submissions were chosen to maximize the impact of an upvote by upvoting the first 5 links on /newest and hence the most recently submitted: a submission at the very bottom, like #30, will benefit least from an upvote since its time is up and it's almost vanished.
If the effect on the first 5 is TODO, and the effect on the last link (#30) is 0, then a reasonable guess at the mean effect over all links is simply TODO/2.

## Reddit comparison

One might wonder if HN is uniquely aberrant in this lottery; the most natural comparison is the social news site Reddit.
I picked /r/prog (a very large subreddit comparable to HN in size) and manipulated their [/new/](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/new/) the same way
