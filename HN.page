# Submissions

Question: is submitting to HN worthwhile?

Simple experiment: submit each day one link to gwern.net + 2 links to other domains. These serve as both a rough control for that day's difficulty of front page, any benefits or penalties applied to my account, and repayment to HN for the potential spamming.

per nathanael's post, I tried to consistently post around 10AM EST (I don't get up early enough to do 7-8AM EST). Apparently he's wrong? Oh well.

multi-level Poisson model? Group by Domain and cross group by Day. mixture model? seems appropriate for two different groups (those who make front page and those who don't)

# /newest

While using HN, as a sort of 'public service', I occasionally made sure to visit the [newest submissions](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest "New Links") page rather than just the [main front page](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) most people read; after a while, I noticed that the links I upvoted there seemed to be turning up a lot on the front page, more than I would expect from my usual pattern of upvoting perhaps 5 links out of the 30 available. A horrible suspicion struck me: could the apparent arbitrariness of what links made the front page be caused by the /newest page being *so* sparsely voted upon that a single upvote made a meaningful difference?

I decided to do a simple experiment to test: On /newest, take the first 5 links, flip a coin to decide whether to upvote or ignore; and make no votes on any other /newest items. After 30 or so (should be enough if the difference is as dramatic as I expect) do a nonparametric test of the two groups; then can dichotomize into front-page/not, do a logistic regression to calculate the specific odds increase due to 1 upvote, extract page views & time on page from my old Analytics, letting me calculate 'how much time am I steering with, say, 10 upvotes on /newest?'

One might wonder if HN is uniquely aberrant in this lottery; the most natural comparison is the social news site Reddit. I picked /r/prog's [/new/](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/new/) to do the same thing to:

Just a test of differences here, because I'm not sure what the equivalent of 'front page' is for Reddit.
