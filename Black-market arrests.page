> I compile a table and discussion of all known arrests and prosecutions related to Tor-Bitcoin black-markets such as Silk Road 1, along with discussion of how they came to be arrested.

Online black-market users have been arrested in a number of countries, for many different reasons, and dating back to not long after the opening of Silk Road 1 in January 2011.
Because of the novelty of such markets and the relatively durable communities, a surprising number of arrests eventually become known.
While we'll never know all the users who experienced imperial entanglements, published reports at least yield a lower bound on their numbers and are enlightening as to law enforcement methods & OPSEC lessons.

For information on the markets themselves (active & past), see [Black-market survival](/Black-market survival); for discussion of the ordering process, economics, cryptography, and politics of the black-markets, see [Silk Road](/Silk Road).

The sections are split up by market, then by country.

<!-- Ideas for a future logistic regression:
- buyer vs seller
- number of transactions
- country-level predictors
- domestic vs international packages

<!-- estimating risk: how many sellers, buyers, transactions?
If you're curious, you could look at known sales/users numbers for SR1 and try to extrapolate some good guesses, from the Ulbricht indictment and from Christin's paper https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/publications/Christin-WWW13.pdf

The indictment/complaint says that Feb 2011 - July 2013, there were 957k total accounts, 1.229m transactions from 147k buyer accounts, 9.5m btc sales volume; Christin says among other things that "Over the measurement interval February 3, 2012- July 24, 2012, we indeed found 1,239 distinct sellers".

So quickly dividing by month, that gives:

total accounts: 33k/month; buyer accounts: 5.1k/month; new sellers: 73/month; transactions: 42k/month; turnover: 327k/month

I haven't finished compiling into a table, but let's say that for SR1 there were >30 seller arrests, and SR1 lasted from February 2011 to September 2013 (counting only full months) or 32 months. Then there were 2336 unique sellers (73*32) of which >30 were arrested for a risk of >0.012 or >1.3%.

Similarly, if there were >60 buyer arrests (I double because there seem to be more buyer arrests than seller arrests, they just tend to take plea deals and not be publicized), then the same calculation would go there are 163200 buyers of which >60 were arrested for a risk of >0.04%

# Table

- Role: buyer, seller, staff, or market founder/operator; each has distinct risks and LE interest and should be distinguished
- Market: the black-market a person was most affiliated with or was busted in connection with

    For example, a Silk Road 1 employee working at Silk Road 2 would be classified as SR1-related because he had provided DPR1 his dox and was busted as a consequence of SR1, not because he worked at SR2 when he was arrested; oppositely, a seller like California Cannabis, who had sold on SR1 but was busted after being deanonymized by the undercover agent through the SR2 seller portal, would be classified as SR2-related. And a seller who sold on a market but was busted through his own off-market sales will be marked with the relevant market.

These seem to be mostly XK customers. I include a row for each such case.

# Confirmed
## Agora
## New Zealand

On 11 August 2014, an [unnamed polytechnic college student](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/312318/dunedin-ecstasy-lsd-haul "Student charged over party drug haul") was arrested for importing LSD/MDMA after customs interceptions, sourced "from Germany and the United Kingdom via the internet."
(He may have been sentenced in December 2014 to [4.5 years prison](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/65784334/Three-men-arrested-over-drug-importation-to-Dunedin).)

### Uganda

On 11 December 2014, the American [Ryan Andrew Gustafson was arrested in Uganda](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/18/us/ap-us-counterfeiting-uganda.html "Feds: Uganda-Based Man Counterfeited $2M in Cash") for counterfeiting money ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-charges-filed-against-us-citizen-connection-multi-million-dollar-international-cyber); [complaint](/docs/sr/2014-12-17-agora-willyclock-complaint.pdf); [docket](/docs/sr/2014-12-22-pacer-willyclock.maff); [Agora forums](http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php/topic,15752.msg3148560.html#msg3148560)); he was the seller "Willy.Clock" who had sold on Evolution until banned and then Agora & his own site.
He had been uncovered after an American user of his counterfeit currency was detected, the packages sent by Willy.Clock profiled, his fingerprints found, the reshipper located in Uganda, and then an undercover deal set up.
(Willy.Clock worked closely with "Mr Mouse" and "Ink", who may be compromised.)

### USA

In January 2015, [Austin Frembling was arrested](http://www.fresnobee.com/2015/02/20/4389411/fresno-man-indicted-for-possession.html) in Fresno, California, for buying \3k of MDMA off Agora from a Canadian seller ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/cae/news/docs/2015/2015_02/02-19-15Frembling.html); [complaint](/docs/sr/2015-frembling-caed-03307884002.pdf); [docket](/docs/sr/2015-02-22-agora-fremblingdocket.maff); [previous record](http://mugshot-record-search.com/mugshot/CA/Fresno-County-Sheriff-Office/2013-Feb-07/4023889/BRYAN-FREMBLING)).
His package was intercepted by Customs (possibly due to inadequate stealth), then a controlled delivery was done to his PO box.

## Black Market Reloaded
### Israel

On ~8 January 2014, the [Israeli man Amit Sand was arrested for buying a gun](http://posta.co.il/index.php/widgetkit/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D-2/%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%91/1604-%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%97-%D7%94%D7%93%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%98-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F "אקדח הדארקנט הראשון: בחבילה שהגיעה לסניף דואר בתל אביב התגלה אקדח מפורק שהוסלק בתוך מגף * מזמין החבילה הודה כי רכש את האקדח ברשת האינטרנט הסודית באמצעות המטבע הדיגיטלי ביטקוין, ובמשטרה תוהים: האם נחשפה דרך חדשה להברחת אמצעי לחימה לישראל?") off a black-market seller for ~$1550 in bitcoins; the first package of parts (mailed 18 December 2013) was discovered by Customs and allowed to go through, and he was arrested after picking up the final second package.
I assign this buy to BMR, since while BMR had closed a week or two before the first package was mailed, the deal could have been agreed upon earlier, and no other major market allowed guns at the time; this may be like the Korff case, where the purchase (ricin, in his case) began on BMR but continued off-market after BMR closed.

## BlackMarket Reloaded (BMR)

A major BlackMarket Reloaded (BMR) seller seems to have been arrested & charged in Kentucky in [August/September 2013](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/dark-web-black-market-reloaded-adam-bunger-gun-sales-arrest/ "Cops may have just busted a major illegal gun dealer from the Deep Web") for international gun sales, after packages were intercepted.

Another BMR gun dealer ("Gun Wise") was [arrested 7 November 2013](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/07/sting-operation-nabs-alleged-online-arms-dealer-via-silk-road-competitor-site/). -->

## Evolution
### USA

"In or about mid-2014" the TCF/Evolution seller "Dark_Mart" was taken over by the FBI^[See Cheng Le complaint: "In or about mid-2014, an FBI online covert employee (the 'OCE') assumed  online Dark-Web identity, which had previously been used by a trafficker in illicit materials, including, among other things, biological toxins."].
The details are unknown, but Dark_Mart rejoined the Evolution forums after a long absence spanning that period with a comment about guns bringing heat on his suppliers^[Dark_Mart last posts on Evolution 2014-03-03 normally then posts again on 2014-08-29 that "I just recently logged back into evo and contacted some of you about my status. The bottom line is that one of my suppliers got arrested on gun charges and it brought some heat on our operation. I had to go off the grid for a while but Dark_Mart is back!"], which may or may not be the FBI agent telling the truth to be safe.

Stephen & Cynthias Jones [were arrested 2 October 2014](http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=280308 "Flowery Branch couple busted on drug charges") after a CD of a package of MDMA from what may be the Evolution Dutch seller "weedybusnis" (he has many complaints of non-arriving or slow packages, suggesting his stealth is subpar or he's been profiled).

The New York carder Cheng Le (Evolution seller FNU/fnufnu) [was arrested 23 December 2014](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-usa-crime-ricin-idUSKBN0KT2G020150120 "New York man charged with trying to buy ricin 'death pills' online") after buying the poison ricin from the Evolution seller "Dark_Mart", who turned out to have been flipped "In or about mid-2014" by the FBI ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-york-man-indicted-attempting-acquire-deadly-toxin-ricin); [complaint](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/21/cheng_le_complaint_comp.pdf); [Evolution pages](/docs/sr/2015-02-24-evolution-chenglericin.tar.xz)).

## Silk Road 1 (SR1)
### Australia

An Australian student's MDMA was [intercepted by Customs](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10819029 "Officer's link to net drug market") but the article makes no mention of him being penalized.

The [prosecution](http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2012/july/afp-and-Customs-warn-users-of-silk-road.aspx "Media Release: AFP and Customs warn users of Silk Road") & [conviction](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/secret-website-harboured-drugs-smorgasbord-court-hears-20130131-2dlw3.html) of the SR seller Paul Leslie Howard was to related to a Customs interception of his large imports from Netherlands/Germany according to the [judge's sentencing verdict](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCC/2013/70.html).



Another Australian seller, Christopher Owen, was pulled over by police in April 2012 while driving to the post office to mail shipments, the drugs found, his house searched, and [was sentenced to 5 years](http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1508217/jail-time-for-web-drug-trafficker/ "Jail time for web drug trafficker") ([discussion](/docs/sr/2013-04-17-australia.mht "Title: SILK ROAD VENDOR JUST GOT BUSTED AND CONVICTED Post by: AussieMitch on May 17, 2013, 12:59 am")).

In August 2012, the MDMA buyer Ryan West, who resold locally, was [convicted of 4 charges](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-05/dark-internet-linked-to-drug-seizure-spike/4410872 "Dealers shed light on dark Internet's drug trade").

[2 unnamed teens](http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/14980079/brothers-in-court-over-online-drugs/ "Brothers in court over online drugs") made the mistake of ordering marijuana, MDMA, and amphetamines from SR1; their parents turned them in & they were charged in September 2012.

A [7 November 2012](http://www.theherald.com.au/story/734298/detectives-follow-the-silk-road/ "Detectives follow the Silk Road") Australian article claims 30 interceptions a month in an area, but mentions nothing specific about arrests.
A [December 2012 article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-05/dark-internet-linked-to-drug-seizure-spike/4410872 "Dealers shed light on dark Internet's drug trade") quotes Customs claiming a 40% increase in seizures, but then quotes a SR seller as claiming a doubling or quadrupling of Australian buyers (hence, implying the interception rate has halved or worse).
Estimating total number of Australian users is difficult, but the 2012 Global Drug Survey reportedly found [184 SR purchasers in its sample of >6600 Australians](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/teens-flock-to-hidden-website-for-drugs-20130319-2gddg.html "Teens flock to hidden website for drugs") suggesting a risk of arrest or publicity $\lt \frac{5}{184}$ (and incidentally, remembering this is a biased sample and the South Australian [recent illicit drug use rate](http://www.dassa.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=204 "Statistics on Illicit Drug Use in South Australia") is ~14.9%, it suggests a very loose upper bound of all Australian SR users of $23000000 \times 0.149 \times \frac{184}{6600} \lt 95541$).

The teen Preston Bridge died accidentally in February 2013 after taking "synthetic LSD" bought by a friend on Silk Road; the friend was [prosecuted & sentenced to 12 months' probation](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-09/teenager-sentenced-for-offering-drugs-to-a-boy-who-died-balcony/5510468 "Hotel balcony death: Teenager sentenced for offering to supply drugs bought on Silk Road to Preston Bridge").

Also in February 2013, [Patrick Franzini](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/drug-accused-allowed-to-travel-to-world-cup-20140605-39l02.html "Drug accused allowed to travel to World Cup") [was arrested](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/drug-dealer-who-was-granted-bail-to-attend-soccer-world-cup-escapes-jail-term-20141126-11uei8.html "Drug dealer who was granted bail to attend soccer World Cup escapes jail term") after a search related to customs interceptions of amphetamines sent from Netherlands, Canada, & China.

[Reportedly](http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/lifestyle/article/-/17821047/online-black-market/ "Online drug market: Drug smugglers have taken their business online, using a hidden website to sell illicit substances and delivering them straight to people's doors."), a June 2013 Parcel Post sting seized 140 packages/$8m & "Six of those arrested were Silk Road members."

As of July 2013, there was ["at least one criminal prosecution in WA [Western Australia] that involves Silk Road"](http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/17891240/silk-road-deals-go-underground/ "Silk Road deals go underground"), and WA police estimate "47 active Australian-based sellers who use Silk Road"; that prosecution may have been "A 26-year-old man, who was charged with attempting to possess drugs from the site, was fined \$1000" [as of 10 August 2013](https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/18437383/first-wa-convictions-for-silk-road-trades/).

An Australian investigation starting in January 2013 [arrested two fake ID manufacturers](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/hundreds-of-fake-credit-cards-and-identities-seized-from-a-western-sydney-home-set-up-as-a-factory-of-fraud/story-fni0cx12-1226717700640) in September 2013; coverage does not mention SR, but [a Redditor plausibly identifies them](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o8xsb/australian_id_vendor_ausid_busted_not_due_to_sr/) as having been the fake ID seller "Ausid" who stopped selling on SR in March 2013.

The former Silk Road moderator/employee SSBD/Symmetry was [arrested in Brisbane on 20 December 2013](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR.php) ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR/Jones,%20Andrew,%20et%20al%20\(Silk%20Road\)%20Indictment.pdf)).

At some point in 2013, the Australian man Luke Hanley was [arrested after 2 packages of 25i & 25c](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/man-faces-jail-after-2700-drug-tablets-on-notorious-site-silk-road/story-fni0fee2-1226851736371 "Man faces jail after 2700 drug tablets on notorious site Silk Road") (and possibly an amphetamine package) were intercepted by Customs, and [pled guilty in 2014](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-14/melbourne-man-avoids-jail-for-ordering-drugs-on-silk-road-websi/5321098).

A [Launceston, Tasmania man was convicted in 2014](http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2185778/hidden-drug-site-use-increasing/) of possession of 25i & BDMPEA partially (?) bought on SR; it's unclear how he was caught.

### Austria

On 4 November 2013, [2 men were arrested](http://noe.orf.at/news/stories/2626608/ "Silk-Road: Festnahme in St. Pölten") for selling opium, MDMA, & amphetamine, as well as 6 of their customers.
Based on [a forum thread](/docs/sr/sr2f-18619-austriaarrest-blackjack021.html) & seller profile, [I've identified this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/2xlxhs/sr1_seller_blackjack021_6_customers_busted_in/) as the SR1 seller "Blackjack021".

### Canada

The aforementioned Tessellated claimed "we have not even once had a report of anyone having any legal trouble or 'love letters' from our product. On several occasions customs has opened our package, not found the product and sent it intact to the buyer."

In May 2012, the high-volume cocaine Canadian seller "moveitnice" mentioned postal delays and then disappeared; according to buyers in [the forum discussion](/docs/sr/2013-11-11-moveitnicebust.mht "http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=printpage;topic=23378.0 Title: I'm calling my shot. MiN has gone rogue/been compromised. Post by: Iamnotamod on May 16, 2012, 07:00 pm"), moveitnice accepted Western Union and the recipient of the WU payments matched the names in [the arrests of a family of 4 Ottawans](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ottawa/ne-no/pr-cp/2012/20120518-eng.htm) for mailing cocaine which was announced by the RCMP on 18 May. (My search of Canadian court records was unable to find their case; possibly their case has been publication-banned or discharged.)
<!-- [_Gawker_](http://gawker.com/5926440/are-authorities-closing-in-on-the-online-drug-market-silk-road "Are Authorities Closing In On the Online Drug Market Silk Road?") covers another case of the Canadian cocaine exporter MoveItNice apparently busted because they accepted payment via [Western Union](!Wikipedia). -->

In August 2012, neighbors tipped off Calgary, Alberta police about drugs; the raid also [turned up a garage](https://web.archive.org/web/20120827025357/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Homes+evacuated+police+bust+suspected+drug/7136987/story.html) for producing DMT, and [Shawn Casey was arrested & charged](http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/08/25/dmt-suspected-in-drug-lab "DMT suspected in drug bust") 22 August 2012.
He has been identified on Reddit ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/ysm4d/canadian_dmt_vendor_trojan_potentially_busted_in/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/26zwdx/maybe_this_is_to_much_to_ask/chw4d06)) & [SR1F](/docs/sr/2013-04-16-dmt.mht "Title: Curious about SR Vendor busts Post by: mollyexpress on April 16, 2013, 06:06 am") as the Calgary DMT seller "Trojan".

### England

A [Reddit user](http://www.reddit.com/user/xxcxcxc) [claims in June 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27m64o/i_am_one_of_the_first_people_to_be_charged_with/?sort=old) to have been importing MDMA into the UK from the Netherlands off SR1 for personal consumption & resale through friends for ~6 months; sometime before 2013<!-- 'worst 18 months', posted 06 2014 --> a package of 100 pills was detected by customs and he accepted delivery, leading to his house being searched; he was then convicted (in large part due to text messages on his phone & emails on his computer) and given a suspended sentence.

After the SR bust in October 2013, the Devon UK seller of accessories like marijuana seeds/MBB+ packaging/[kratom](!Wikipedia) ("PlutoPete"), reported he had been [raided & questioned](/docs/sr/2013-10-03-plutopete.mht "Title: WARNING PLUTOPETE HAS BEEN RAIDED! MOVE YOUR DRUGS NOW; Post by: RR on October 03, 2013, 12:14 am") and likely charged with his personal drugs^["My solicitor is confidant [sic] I've broken no UK laws in selling my products, but they did find a small amount of class A and class B drugs that were for my own personal use so i will be charged with that at the very least."] but not charged over his SR sales.
3 more in Manchester were [arrested & charged](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nz4yl/four_men_arrested_in_uk_over_role_in_silk_road/); the description of a three-man seller mailing from Manchester seems to match at least two SR sellers, "JesusOfRave" and "TechnoHippy", the former of whom [quickly denied being arrested](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1381.0;all), while the latter last appeared on the SR forums in mid-September 2013, he resurfaced on the SR2 forums [likewise denying any involvement](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=2889.0 "Technohippy is back! (and now verified)").

<!-- I believe at least two of the vendors were based in Manchester, and I know one of them sold bitcons for cash deposits to a bank account so if it is the vendor I am thinking of who got busted that's probably why. -->
<!-- There was a small UK vendor called something like Mangled1 who got busted.
Ordering a reship on a load of pills from the Netherlands to his house, the first shipment got caught. The second, the police replaced the pills with vitamins of the same colour. A few minutes after it was delivered they knocked down his door, he was sitting there surrounded by all his drugs, laptop, etc.
...They came on the forums after they'd been busted and said what had happened but I think all their posts got deleted soon after. They ordered (I think it was) 500, yellow supermans, don't which vendor and they probably didn't use their vendor account. He definitely ordered to the same address he lived and vended from.
Customs didn't do anything about the first package but when they caught the reship they raided him. -->

### France

On 14 December 2013, the French vendor "WalkaBoot" (marijuana & amphetamines) [was arrested by Customs](http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/info-bfmtv-loire-un-cyberdealer-interpelle-premiere-france-674582.html "INFO BFMTV - Loire: un cyberdealer interpellé, première en France: Depuis une ferme isolée, il vendait des produits stupéfiants sur Internet en utilisant un routeur indétectable. Un mode opératoire inédit en France. Interpellé samedi dernier, il a été présenté mardi devant la justice").

### Germany

4 people were [arrested in Germany](/docs/sr/2013-07-09-germany.mht "Title: Big Germany bust. Arrest of Silkroad vendor a big maybe. Post by: DealerOfDrugs on July 09, 2013, 02:40 pm") in July 2013, apparently by tracing another drug seller's supplier with repeated orders which were sent from the same spot by the couriers (and were easily busted), and then to that SR seller-group (possibly "AfterHour") & possibly payments via mail (German coverage: [1](http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/ermittler-zerschlagen-internationalen-drogenring-a-910221.html "Internationaler Drogenring: Ermittler nehmen vier Verdächtige fest"), [2](http://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article117869257/Fahnder-zerschlagen-Bitcoin-Drogenring-DarkNet.html "Fahnder zerschlagen Bitcoin-Drogenring DarkNet: Über eine verschlüsselte Plattform im Internet hat eine Bande mit Drogen gehandelt.

### Ireland

On [20 December 2013](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR.php) ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR/Jones,%20Andrew,%20et%20al%20\(Silk%20Road\)%20Indictment.pdf)), the former SR administrator/moderator/employee "Libertas" (also of Silk Road 2) was [arrested in Wicklow, Ireland](http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/1220/494111-silk-road-arrest/ "Former Silk Road administrator arrested in Wicklow") but apparently [made bail & fled](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/12/20/feds-indict-three-more-alleged-employees-of-the-silk-roads-dread-pirate-roberts/ "Feds Indict Three More Alleged Employees Of Silk Road's Dread Pirate Roberts").

### Israel

DeepDotWeb reports (personal communication) that at the beginning of 2013, a small Israeli buyer of multiple drugs off SR1 (unknown seller) was arrested & sentenced to six months.

### Japan

Ayumu Teramoto was [arrested for importing 50g of a "stimulant"](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Japan-makes-Bitcoin-linked-drug-arrest-police-medi-30233259.html) in May 2014.

### Netherlands

In September 2013, [6 Dutchmen](http://www.mickvanwely.nl/de-xtc-bende-van-sinterklaas/) were arrested for MDMA sales on SR; the arrests stemmed from a car search turning up thousands of pills in 22 November 2012 and then a raid of their manufacturing location 5 April 2013 (one commenter [speculates](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1lkm8i/dutch_vendors_selling_xtc_packaged_in_church_dvds/cc0ef4v) they were the missing MDMA seller "MedicalM").

On 9 October 2013, following a month of wiretapping & Blackberry observation, 2 Dutchmen (the seller "XTCExpress") were [arrested while making MDMA pills & charged](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o8sek/vendor_xtcexpress_arrested_in_the_netherlands_on/) ([_Daily Mail_](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2456758/Two-Dutch-Silk-Road-vendors-alias-XTC-Express-caught-red-handed-layer-MDMA-hair.html)), ultimately [receiving 4-5 years](http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/05/08/rechter-geeft-online-drugsdealers-tot-vijf-jaar-cel/ "Judge gives online drug dealers five years in prison").

The MDMA seller "SuperTrips" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/24bb54ca7e.htm); [DoJ announcement](http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2014/pr0424_01.html); [complaint](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2013_08_28_SLOMP_affidavit.pdf); [charges](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/silkroadplea.pdf)) was arrested on traveling to the USA in August 2013 to meet a SR1 reseller, "UnderGroundSyndicate"/"BTCMaster" (who was arrested with SuperTrip's help in October).
US Customs intercepted >100 packages mailed by SuperTrips, built up a profile, found fingerprints on the packages, checked the Netherlands's fingerprint databases & found a match, detained SuperTrips when he attempted to enter the USA, seized & searched his laptop's files (illustrating the lack of civil rights at borders), he admitted selling during an interview, and eventually reached a plea agreement.
His arrest was rumored on forums, and DPR2 of SR2 [specifically alluded to SuperTrip's arrest](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/dread-pirate-roberts-2-0-an-interview-with-silk-roads-new-boss/) in late 2013/early 2014 that "it was quite boring the third time law enforcement decided to use the 'SuperTrips' moniker and claiming to be him as a free man, when I know just as well as ICE where he is now", although the case was only publicly announced in April 2014.

### New Zealand

A New Zealand Customs officer who likely used SR was charged with possessing & "supplying" methamphetamine but this "was uncovered during police inquiries into another crime", with the resolution unclear. A young NZer's MDMA was confiscated by Customs and his house visited, whereupon he admitted guilt to the officers and unsurprisingly was [arrested & convicted](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/court/7958999/Drugs-ordered-on-web "Drugs ordered on web"). What seems to be a third NZer was [sentenced to 18 months probation](http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/chch-man-sentenced-after-buying-amazon-illegal-drugs-website-ck-135659 "Christchurch man sentenced after buying from 'Amazon of illegal drugs' website"). A NZer was arrested [in April 2013](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10879570 "Teen arrested for importing, ordering drugs online") over multiple very large orders from an online site, which may or may not have been SR. That article estimates 52m items passing through Customs in 2012 with 1.4k intercepted as drugs; an earlier [NZ article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10826287 "Online drug trade triggers high alert") claimed 80 interceptions a month with 7 arrests January-July 2012 or 1 arrest a month (suggesting each interception has a risk of leading to an arrest of ~1/80; the risk per order then depends on how many of the 52m items were drug packages). An [August 2012 article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10826287 "Online drug trade triggers high alert") elaborates on those figures:

> "There have been approximately 80 intercepts a month [from] people we believe have utilised the Silk Road enterprise," Day said. In cases linked to Silk Road from January to July, 13 search warrants were issued, 15 further properties visited and seven arrests made.

In April 2013, a student importing cocaine, MDMA, & LSD for resale had packages intercepted by Customs, leading to a search and then [sentencing in February 2014](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/9896985/Jail-for-drug-importing-student).

In September 2013, [3 NZers](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/court/9133368/Trio-got-drugs-from-internet-site "Trio got drugs from internet site") were convicted of importing MDMA & cocaine. Another NZer was [convicted of importing methamphetamine](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/9517934/Silk-Road-to-jail-for-meth-importer "Silk Road to jail for meth importer"). And a fourth NZer's 2 MDMA & NBOMe shipments were intercepted by Customs, leading to a search of his house & [sentencing in April 2014](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/9945908/Psychedelic-tabs-ordered-online "Psychedelic tabs ordered online").

On 11 December 2013, another 3 NZers were arrested over various orders of "small quantities of LSD, Methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), Class C analogue powders and the psychoactive substance NBOMe" from unspecified black-markets "such as 'The Silk Road'". (Inasmuch as Silk Road was busted 2 October 2013, they may have actually been ordering from a replacement such as Sheep MarketPlace.)

In April 2014, a [NZ man was convicted](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10232509/Doing-time-for-drugs-bought-online) after 2 packages of methamphetamine from Canada were intercepted in September & November 2013; the search had also turned up LSD and marijuana.

In December 2014, the SR1 MDMA/marijuana buyers Daniel Wayne Fowler & Lisa Marie Clark were sentenced after an investigating beginning with customs intercepts in September 2013 ([1](http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/63779228/Silk-Road-drug-buyers-in-court) [2](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11368206)).

December 2014 also saw the SR2 buyer Andrew Graham Hodgson sentenced for importing methamphetamine, marijuana & NBOMe; his mail had been intercepted from July to September 2014 ([1](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/63743171/five-arrests-in-500k-meth-sting), [2](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/63857494/silk-road-leads-to-home-detention)).

### Sweden

[2 Swedish men](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nz4uo/two_swedes_arrested_for_suspicion_of_selling_weed/) (the seller "SweExpress"), were arrested 8 October 2013 for selling marijuana; [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o03li/police_are_rounding_up_former_silk_road_drug/ccnobzx) [users](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nz4uo/two_swedes_arrested_for_suspicion_of_selling_weed/ccnmhh9) on Reddit noted that SweExpress ceased mailing orders a week before the SR raid.

<!-- "there's been several released court documents as of late regarding a Swedish vendor called SweExpress who was roughly in the top 4 % before the original Silk Road went bust, yet searching these forums no one is talking about that. I've been considering translating some of the court documents but I've simply been too busy to do so, the case is discussed in a major Swedish forum called Flashback over at the topic Helsingborgare, 29 och 34 år, häktade för att köpa/sälja på Silk Road: https://www.flashback.org/t2234859 One interesting tidbit from the documents is the fact law enforcement were staking out the postal center used by the two involved in the operation, thus managing to track over 100 packages and subsequent names and addresses." -->

In September 2011, the Silk Road 1 buyer of LSD & MDMA [Stacy Litz](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1v5g5u/september_2011_sr_prosecution_stacy_litz/) was arrested in Pennsylvania after selling LSD to an undercover officer; she became an informant.

On 28 October 2013, the Maryland former seller ["digitalink"](/docs/sr/2013-06-07-digitalink-profile.html), Jacob Theodore George IV, was [charged in federal court](/docs/sr/digitalink-courtrecords.maff) (previously convicted of a number of offenses in state courts) for his heroin & [methylone](!Wikipedia) (banned October 2011) sales a year & a half previously (he stopped in January 2012), and [pled guilty](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-silk-road-plea-20131105,0,7979360.story "Silk Road drug dealer pleads guilty: Jacob T. George IV, 32, sold heroin and methylone using online market"), ultimately receiving [a sentence of 6 years](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-silk-road-sentencing-20140905,0,5703914.story "Silk Road drug dealer gets six years prison: Jacob Theodore George IV, 33, sold heroin through online marketplace").
The [complaint/indictment](/docs/sr/digitalink-federalcomplaint-1-13-cr-00593-CCB.pdf) does not specify what evidence the case is based on, why such a long delay, or why no arrest, and many of the PACER documents remain sealed or unavailable as of 23 February 2015 (so we don't know the details or how exactly he was cooperating); but based on [digitalink's forum posts](/docs/sr/digitalink-profile.maff) and [forum discussions of him](/docs/sr/digitalink-forumdiscussions.maff), it seems he was an extremely careless vendor who disdained PGP, retrieved product seized by the Post Office (one forum-user presciently exclaimed in August 2011, "Oh wow, the idiocy is unmatched! It seems very possible that digitalink will be busted sometime soon."), told other people who his methylone supplier was, gave his phone number to buyers, and ultimately failed to deliver \$3500 of methylone to a buyer "thoth" who then [threatened to give digitalink's information to the police](/docs/sr/digitalink-thoth.maff).

During the SR1 trial, the DHS agent DerYeghiayan engaged in purchases ["from March 2012 until September 2013...Using an account obtained from an actual user, with the screen name of 'dripsofacid'"](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2870812/us-government-lurked-on-silk-road-for-over-a-year.html "U.S. government lurked on Silk Road for over a year"), which was used for [at least one buy in April 2013](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/silk-road-trial-federal-agent-explains-how-he-trapped-ulbricht/); "dripsofacid"'s account may have been obtained after an unknown arrest during that time period. <!-- also "Mr Wonderful" -->

On 5 May 2012, the Massachusetts [Bard College student](http://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/ci_26681481/former-bard-college-at-simons-rock-student-avoids "Former Bard College at Simon's Rock student avoids jail on drug charges") Mehran Jahedi's rooms were searched & campus security found "LSD, ketamine, amphetamines, hallucinogenic mushrooms, MDMA, mescaline and marijuana, as well as packaging originating from as far away as China, Germany and Poland", which he had been reselling locally after sourcing them from the "darknet", and ultimately received a suspended sentence in 2014; given the variety, it is almost certain he was purchasing from SR1 rather than any of the other SR1-era markets (BMR/Darkbay/Sheep/Atlantis).

The account of the SR1 clonazepam/marijuana seller "alllove" was used by the FBI in 27 September 2012 & earlier as part of its investigation into SR1, and [screenshots taken with it](/docs/sr/ulbrichttrial-evidence-gx109redacted.pdf) were [entered into evidence](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2014_12_10_ULBRICHT_evidence_lists.pdf) at Ross Ulbricht's 2015 trial.
alllove must have been busted somehow before September 2012, for his account to have become the FBI's property, and explaining his abrupt disappearance sometime before 19 May 2012 (remarked upon at the time [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1emvyg/favorite_vendors/); there may be more accurate timings in [SR1F hits for "alllove"](/docs/sr/sr1f-alllove.tar.xz)) but all other details are unknown.
(The [old SR1 seller Grand Wizard says](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/2uxzus/sr1_seller_alllove_busted_mid2012/coczhg6) that alllove may also have sold bitcoins for cash in the mail or other fiat; this is an extremely risky occupation and if true, almost certainly how he was busted.)

In December 2012, a [New Jersey buyer was busted for marijuana in a controlled delivery](http://www.news10.net/news/article/251775/2/Cross-county-drug-ring-using-dark-Internet-site-busted-by-feds) when the package was detected in the mail; he cooperated (no additional penalties specified in article) and 2 sellers were eventually arrested & charged in July 2013.

SR forum posters have claimed that a [DMT seller, cocaine seller, & 2 others](/docs/sr/2013-04-16-dmt.mht "Title: Curious about SR Vendor busts Post by: mollyexpress on April 16, 2013, 06:06 am") have all been busted but apparently for their offline connections and activities (the poster claims the DMT seller had too many people visiting and his neighbors squealed; this was likely the Canadian seller "Trojan"). A Redditor claims [a friend was arrested at his PO box](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1kluze/has_anyone_in_this_subreddit_actually_ever_gotten/cbqg9h1), a second claims his cousin was [convicted of ordering marijuana & MDMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1f1joh/things_i_learned_from_watching_my_cousin_lose_his/) without a controlled delivery, and there were several claims to have been arrested or convicted [in an August 2013 Reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1kluze/has_anyone_in_this_subreddit_actually_ever_gotten/) (these claims are not verifiable).

In January 2013, according to the SR bust indictments, a seller & SR employee ("chronic pain"/"chronicpain"/"Flush")  was arrested & charged in Maryland after receiving a kilo of cocaine from an undercover agent; he then cooperated with the FBI in entrapping Ulbricht into ordering a hit on him and then pretending to be dead.
[He was identified in October as Curtis Clark Green](http://antilop.cc/sr/#assassination_plot) ([discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1po2og/silk_road_tales_and_archives_another_bad_opsec/)).
Green's [plea-agreement](http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2013/131107baltimore1.pdf) ([transcript](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1q4vic/the_maryland_employee_is_revealed_pleading_guilty/cd9bmpm)) was [released on 7 November 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131118015343/http://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Man-pleads-guilty-to-playing-key-drug-site-role-4964858.php), without any details of his cooperation after his arrest in Utah (although ["the U.S. attorney's office said his computer was forensically examined after it was seized"](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-silk-road-employee-20131107,0,5353243.story)); interestingly, the plea-agreement notes that the undercover agent did not know the cocaine package was being delivered to the same SR administrator who had helped him find a seller for his cocaine.

In February 2013, there were two cases of Americans being busted in [Florida](http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2013/feb/22/man-arrested-after-accepting-drug-package-mail/ "Deputies: Man arrested after accepting drug package through mail") and [Loui](http://www.wwltv.com/news/Laundry-List-of-Drugs-at-Uptown-Frat-House-Leads-to-Tulane-Student-Arrests-193450441.html "Laundry list of drugs at Uptown frat house leads to Tulane student arrests")[siana](http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/02/tulane_students_arrested_after.html "Tulane students arrested after allegedly accepting drug delivery at frat house") by signing for MDMA in what is called a ["controlled delivery"](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22controlled+delivery%22&as_sdt=2%2C21); the simultaneity, drug type, & amount immediately led to speculation that they were both ordering from the SR MDMA seller "luckylucianno" who was previously having issues with order interceptions, which was confirmed when one of the arrested men posted on the SR forums warning away others and [relevant threads were deleted by forum moderators](https://web.archive.org/web/20131211213539/http://weirderweb.com/2013/02/26/florida-man-busted-silk-road-promptly-deletes-all-his-posts/) (although a moderator claimed the Louisiana bust was unrelated to SR or the Florida bust). <!-- TODO: these were almost certainly SR, but the Louisiana New Orleans court does not provide any useful information! -->

Sometime in March 2013, an Alaskan buyer of heroin & cocaine apparently received a controlled delivery, and received felony charges; he cooperated in the ongoing investigation of his seller, "NOD", according to the indictment for NOD. An otherwise-unknown female buyer from NOD seems to have been similarly arrested in April/May according to the [TSG](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/silk-road-dealer-cooperating-567432) article on NOD.

On 21 March 2013, the large Californian marijuana group seller "SourDieselMan" replaced their profile page with the message "i am down forever" (last forum comment was 18 March 2013); SR users noted that on 19 March, [a series of marijuana-related raids were executed in California](http://www.willitsnews.com/ci_22836369/six-arrested-3-000-marijuana-plants-and-44 "Humboldt & Sonoma counties: Six arrested, 3,000 marijuana plants and 44 weapons seized in state DOJ raids") near where SourDieselMan apparently shipped from, and [speculate that SourDieselMan may have been arrested in them](/docs/sr/2013-10-26-sourdieselmanreviews.mht "Title: Sourdieselman Official Review thread; Post by: sourdieselman on June 26, 2012, 05:40 pm") (though [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1bfmki/who_replaces_sourdieselman/c96otz1) [users](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1381.msg17659#msg17659) say SourDieselMan was either banned by SR over selling Bitcoins for cash in the mail or traced via this, an activity attested to in the review thread).
[Additional July news coverage](http://www.kcra.com/news/mailorder-marijuana-postal-inspectors-link-operation-to-sac-region/-/11797728/21156348/-/nv5v6u/-/index.html "Mail-order marijuana? Postal inspectors link operation to Sac region: Loomis man, Roseville woman face charges") revealed SourDieselMan to be a group, 2 members of which (Matthew Gillum & Jolene Chan) were arrested & charged with marijuana & finance-related charges.
[The complaint](/docs/sr/2013-07-23-sourdieselman-gillum-complaint.pdf) says the investigation started in August 2012 due to the large sums of cash in mail, did a controlled delivery to a SR marijuana buyer in New Jersey in December 2012, flipped one of the SourDieselMan members, and went from there; for additional details, see the [PACER court records](/docs/sr/2013-11-05-sourdieselman-courtrecords.maff) and the filings for [Gillum](/docs/sr/2013-11-05-sourdieselman-gillum-documents.zip) & [Chan](/docs/sr/2013-11-05-sourdieselman-chan-documents.zip).

On 12 April 2013, a [South Carolinian man](https://web.archive.org/web/20140211094519/http://letstalkbitcoin.com/users-bitcoins-seized-by-dea/) ([the seller "Casey Jones"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gxiv7/srrelated_bitcoin_seizure/caoxlmg), judging by [forum search hits](/docs/sr/2013-06-srforums-caseyjonessearch.html.maff)[^MAFF] and his [posts](/docs/sr/2013-06-truckingcaseyjones.html.maff "Trucking's SR forum posts")) had ฿11 (then \$935) confiscated via a drug law provision ([Hughes blames](http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20130709/PC16/130709464/1177/lawyer-charleston-man-denies-connection-to-dea-bitcoin-seizure-and-illicit-silk-road-drug-marketplace "Lawyer: Charleston man denies connection to DEA Bitcoin seizure and illicit Silk Road drug marketplace") it on the "actions of one of his house guests" and [an additional Bitcoin seizure](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/dea-seizes-bitcoin-seizure-points-to-earlier-mistaken-identity "DEA Seizes Bitcoin: Seizure Points to Earlier Mistaken Identity ") casts a little doubt on the charges); he was arrested in June 2013 and triply charged in Charleston with distribution/possession of marijuana/Clonazepam/DMT/Methylone but he did not seem to be selling marijuana on SR and the [available court records](/docs/sr/2013-08-20-hughescourtrecords.html.maff) do not indicate whether he is being charged due to offline or online drug dealing, but the mention of "two undercover drug buys...in April" imply he was selling off-SR and may have been caught that way.

On 26 April 2013, 2 Iowan men, Adam Lawin & Benjamin Walker, [were](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/one-sentenced-in-silk-road-drug-case/article_7b014078-0499-575d-8e31-356bb431ca94.html "One sentenced in Silk Road drug case") [raided](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/waterloo-man-pleads-guilty-to-selling-ecstacy/article_a57aab93-b9c5-5e3e-8438-6e229c9bd036.html "Waterloo man pleads guilty to selling ecstacy") [for](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/second-person-pleads-in-silk-road-ecstasy-case/article_f83869f2-6011-57be-a38a-90221545dd92.html "Second person pleads in Silk Road ecstasy case") importing MDMA from the UK & Belgium ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/ian/news/2014/feb_14/2_10_14_Lawin.html); [sentencing](/docs/sr/2014-lawin-sentencing-iand07501568757.pdf)).
Customs interceptions of their packages beginning in 2012 were followed by a local undercover buy, which triggered the raid.

During May 2013, a [teen in Indiana](http://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/fishers-teen-admits-buying-drugs-on-dark-net-hidden-online-market "Fishers teen admits buying drugs on 'Dark Net', hidden online market: Mom turned son, drugs over to police") was arrested after his mother informed on him. I also know of another case involving an American who was convicted after a controlled delivery of LSD mailed from the Netherlands; his package was likely detected.

[A complaint](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/handel_indictment.pdf) filed 13 June 2013 against a David Lawrence Handel charges him with distributing methylone, 2C-E, and 2C-C; no full complaint is available and it is apparently sealed.
Handel is known to be SR-related because the edgarnumbers complaint says so.^["There are several related cases. The owner and operator of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht [DPR], is charged with Murder for hire...Other individuals charged in the District of Maryland connection with the Marco Polo task force include Jacob Theodore George IV (CCB-13-0593) [Digitalink], Curtis Clark Green (CCB-13-0592) [Chronicpain], and David Lawrence Handel (CCB-13-0313) [???]. Other individuals have been charged with crimes involving from Silk Road in jurisdictions around the United States and in foreign countries."]
[La Moustache suggests](http://antilop.cc/sr/#the_silk_road_travellers) that Handel was the research-chemical seller [daviddd](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/cdd8e9e8d9.html), based on davidd's sales volume, public silence since the right time, a rumor that he had been arrested, the coincidence that davidd listed 1kg of methylone for sale just like the LE-controlled Digitalink & edgarnumbers seller profiles had, and a suspicious attempt by the davidd attempt to send a 'free sample' to a SR1 moderator.
This identification as the SR1 seller davidd was eventually confirmed when Handel [pled guilty in 2015](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/dealer-pleads-guilty-to-selling-drugs-on-the-silk-road/) ([plea agreement](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2015_01_29_HANDEL_plea_agreement.pdf); [sentencing order](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2015_01_29_HANDEL_sentencing_order.pdf)).
He had been the target of several undercover buys by the Maryland Marco Polo task force which led to his profiling & identification; he was arrested after picking up a package from post office, was carrying a gun, apartment was searched, and wound up handing over his SR1 seller account.

On 28 June 2013, the seller "edgarnumbers" ([profile](/docs/sr/2013-06-07-edgarnumbers-profile.html)) was raided in Nebraska (he had sold methylone among others on SR, and guns on the short-lived Armory); he cooperated (turning over his customers' addresses), was eventually [officially arrested 19 February 2014](http://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Neb-man-charged-in-Silk-Road-case-5253111.php), and his case was unsealed the next day ([complaint](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/sheldon_kennedy_criminal_complaint.pdf)). He had been busted after "digitalink"^[The complaint calls the source "CS-1", but given the date November 2011, the presence of methylone, the mention of spending counterfeit in Baltimore, and his arrest, it is highly unlikely that CS-1 is anyone other than digitalink.] turned over all his customers' addresses in November 2011, which included edgarnumbers's address; he was then targeted for undercover buys and confirmation that he was a drug & gun dealer through his lack of visible income, Gmail & Amazon accounts, Facebook & Google+ profiles, interviews at his local post office & debit card records of many postal purchases, and a return address.^[Some relevant excerpts from the complaint: "Starting in November 2011, agents with Homeland Security Investigations conducted several interviews with a source in Maryland (CS-1) [Digitalink?]. CS-1 had been selling illegal drugs on Silk Road. CS-1 explained how Silk Road worked to the agents, and voluntarily provided access to CS-1's Silk Road accounts, email accounts, and Bitcoin accounts that documented CS-1's own involvement in Silk Road. CS-1's computer was also found to contain CS-1's "customer records", including names and addresses of hundreds of individuals (in the United States and other countries) that received drug shipments from CS-1. [CS-1 was initially not truthful about being a drug dealer on Silk Road. CS-1 was also arrested because he continued to use illegal drugs after his first interview with agents. However, the information provided by CS-1 relied upon in this affidavit has been corroborated by agents' review of the CS-1's Silk Road and email accounts, and files contained on CS-1's computer.]...Among the information provided by CS-1, were records of drugs sold to Sheldon Kennedy, using the alias "edgarnumbers", and shipped to 2222 N. Cotner Blvd, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68505 (the "Residence")...Undercover agents also communicated with Kennedy and made purchases from Kennedy on Silk Road using aliases (including the online identity of CS-1). Kennedy sold these products via Silk Road under the alias "edgarnumbers". These purchases were made from product Kennedy listed as available for sale on Silk Road, and were paid for in Bitcoin. In each case, Kennedy shipped the contraband from Nebraska to an undercover agent in Maryland...Agents queried Kennedy on www.facebook.com and discovered a publicly available profile identified as "Sheldon Kennedy"...Kennedy had made posts on his Facebook page stating he had firearms for sale...On June 28, 2013, a federal search warrant was executed at Kennedy's residence...After signing a written _Miranda_ form, Kennedy also made a voluntary statement to investigators. He admitted he started seling drugs and guns on Silk Road in Summer 2011. He admitted to selling a variety of drugs via Silk Road, including cocaine, methylone, and prescription medication. Kennedy advised that he buys narcotics from China, India, and Serbia. Kennedy admitted to obtaining 24 grams of cocaine from an online vendor which was "fronted". He said he split up the 24 grams and sold them on Silk Road and made approximately \$2,500 to \$3,000...Kennedy admitted to selling drugs on the Silk Road. He also admitted to selling firearms through Silk Road. Kennedy also voluntarily provided agents with control of his Silk Road account, email accounts, and electronic records showing shipping information (including name and address) for Kennedy's sales of drugs and/or firearms. Kennedy also provided control of his financial accounts used to facilitate his criminal activity, including an account [on] the online Bitcoin exchange mtgox.com. A review of these accounts corroborated Kennedy's statement."]

In July 2013 [according to DHS agent Deryeghiayan's testimony](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/silk-road-trial-undercover-dhs-fbi-trap-ross-ulbricht/), the Texas vendor and then SR1 employee ["CaptainMal"/"scout"/"cirrus"](http://antilop.cc/sr/#flotsam)'s account was taken over by law enforcement and the account used to infiltrate SR1 and later SR2; she was likely arrested at some point before that in June or July 2013 on some charge (possibly relating to her activity as a vendor selling bitcoins).

A [New York man was prosecuted in August 2013](http://poststar.com/news/local/police-queensbury-shop-owner-bought-drugs-on-silk-road-website/article_8f45d126-0c1f-11e3-a590-001a4bcf887a.html "Police: Queensbury shop owner bought drugs on Silk Road website") after selling Suboxone in person, having his mail monitored, and then his store (with drugs on the premises) raided.

Also in August 2013, the large Dutch MDMA seller SuperTrips was arrested ([forfeiture](http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2014/pr0424_01a.pdf); [press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2014/pr0424_01.html); [plea agreement](/docs/sr/sr1-supertrips-pleaagreement.pdf)); profiling of his packages and fingerprints provided enough grounds that when he tried to visit the USA, he was detained at the airport, his unencrypted laptop examined and all his records found (including all buyer addresses), whereupon he confessed & began cooperating (helping bust his collaborator UnderGroundSyndicate in October 2013).
(His account would be [used by a DHS undercover agent](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/silk-road-trial-federal-agent-explains-how-he-trapped-ulbricht/) until SR1 was raided 2 months later.)

In September 2013, [two Wisconsin men importing MDMA from Germany](/docs/sr/2013-10-26-wisconsinmdma.maff) saw their package [detected by Customs](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/second-person-pleads-in-silk-road-ecstasy-case/article_f83869f2-6011-57be-a38a-90221545dd92.html "Second person pleads in Silk Road ecstasy case") and received a controlled delivery. Also in September, a [Vermont student was charged with drug possession](https://web.archive.org/web/20140518105328/http://www.vermontcynic.com/news/student-busted-for-silk-road-purchase-1.2841435); he had purchased them off SR, and was reported to police through complaints of "smells of burnt marijuana".

In October 2013, the founder of SR, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in San Francisco and charged with a laundry list of crimes.
Logs from his laptop implicated a college friend, Richard Bates ("baronsyntax") in helping program SR1 and buying some drugs; this was used as leverage to force Bates to testify against Ulbricht in his trial.

Simultaneous with the SR bust, a [Washington](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-heroin-arrest-nod/  "The rise and fall of Silk Road's heroin kingpin") [state man](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Federal-drug-charges-for-Bellevue-man-involved-in-Silk-Road-226387671.html "Federal drug charges for Bellevue man involved in 'Silk Road'") & his girlfriend, the seller "NOD", was charged with heroin selling ([complaint](http://cryptome.org/2013/10/sadler-white-complaint.pdf), [docket](https://ia801904.us.archive.org/18/items/gov.uscourts.wawd.196180/gov.uscourts.wawd.196180.docket.html), [interview](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-confession-steven-sadler-nod/)) with some leniency since [they cooperated after their July bust](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/silk-road-dealer-cooperating-567432 "Top Silk Road Drug Dealer Was Flipped By Feds: Online narcotics kingpin 'Nod' began cooperating after July raid"); a [pseudonymous Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o6whp/attention_i_just_made_bail_as_a_buyer/) claims to have been a customer of NOD, among other sellers, and to have been searched, arrested & charged on 8 October 2013, with (apparently) another [pseudonymous Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o6whp/attention_i_just_made_bail_as_a_buyer/ccpo1f1) reporting state charges & posting his indictment. (Interestingly, NOD did a interview for the [_Drugs Inc._](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1oy6yr/did_anyone_else_notice_nod_was_in_the_drugs_inc/) TV series somewhere around March 2013.)

The Florida seller "UnderGroundSyndicate"/"BTCMaster" Angel William Quinones ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/8184c05ea4.htm), [plea agreement](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2014_05_13_QUINONES_plea_agreement.pdf)) [was arrested](http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/27419179-418/partner-of-ex-largest-online-drug-dealer-plans-to-plead-guilty.html "Partner of ex-largest online drug dealer plans to plead guilty") near-simultaneously with DPR thanks to the cooperation of his partner/supplier, the Dutch seller SuperTrips, who had been arrested when he earlier tried to fly into the USA in August 2013 with an unencrypted laptop after having been identified through latent fingerprints on packaging.

The NY seller of clonazepam/hydrocodone/heroin "deezletime" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/f70952f167.htm)), Michael Duch, was arrested on 1 October 2013 as well, ultimately reaching a plea deal on 10 December 2014, in time to testify in the Ulbricht trial.

On 21 November 2013, the seller "MDpro" was [arrested in Delaware](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-silk-road-orlando-doctor-20131121,0,5782126.story "Doctor charged with selling drugs to local DEA agents via Silk Road") ([seller profile](/docs/sr/2013-06-07-mdpro-profile.html), [forum discussions](/docs/sr/2013-11-22-mdpro-srforums-discussion.maff), [forum posts](/docs/sr/2013-11-22-mdpro-forumposts.maff), [BMR posts under her real name](/docs/sr/2013-11-29-bmr-obollesforum.mht)) and charged in federal court ([PACER web data](/docs/sr/2013-11-11-mdpro-pacer.maff), [complaint/filings](/docs/sr/2013-11-22-mdpro-6-13-mj-01614-DAB.zip)), ultimately sentenced to [2.5 years](http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/01/13/doctor-sentenced-months-silk-road-drug-case/21716135/ "Doctor gets 30 months in Silk Road drug case"); based on the complaint, it seems her fatal mistake was either using tracking on her shipments through an account registered in her real name or putting valid return addresses on her shipments to a PO box registered to her real name, which allowed the undercover buyer to find her and compile the extensive case against her. Among her [many security mistakes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/26/how-a-delaware-doctor-was-linked-to-silk-road-drug-sales/) included [accepting shipments from other sellers](/docs/sr/2013-11-29-mdpro-moonbear.mht) to her apartment addressed to her partner (and [partner in crime](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Del-doc-32-busted-sold-drugs-for-Bitcoins.html "Ob/Gyns who planned to wed busted in Bitcoin drug probe")).

On 25 November 2013, Brandon Howell [was arrested](http://www.wect.com/story/24088516/police-seized-hundreds-of-drugs-in-carolina-beach-bust) after "a month-long investigation" in North Carolina; he & his partner "imported MDMA from China through an online black market...The two then resold the imported drugs using the online currency Bitcoin, according to police." It is not clear which seller they were or what market they sold on, but the media coverage mentions Silk Road 1.

On 17 December 2013, 4 members of the methamphetamine group seller ["hammertime"](/docs/sr/hammertime-profile.htm) [were arrested in Oregon](http://www.kgw.com/news/Wash-county-tactical-police-conducting-3-dawn-raids-236190011.html "Suspected drug trafficking ring busted in Aloha") as well as 3 others charged ([PACER](/docs/sr/2013-12-19-hammertime-pacer.maff), [indictment](/docs/sr/2013-12-10-hammertime-indictment.pdf); [more coverage](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-meth-ring-4-arrests/ "4 arrested in Silk Road meth ring bust, alleged leader faces life in prison"); [trial](http://www.golocalpdx.com/news/portland-is-a-hub-for-online-drug-dealers); [plea agreement](/docs/sr/2015-02-17-hammertime-pleadeal.pdf)).

On [19 December 2013](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR.php) ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR/Jones,%20Andrew,%20et%20al%20\(Silk%20Road\)%20Indictment.pdf); [girlfriend's report](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1tb2yl/sr_admin_and_mod_just_got_arrestedmy_boyfriend/)), the former SR administrator/employee "Inigo" was arrested in Virginia.

<!-- I have some background info on hammertime's downfall.
Don't ask me where I got this information, but this is what happened.
So, hammertime and his associates sold a lot of meth, not unlike myself. Pretty good meth too, by most accounts.
Once he'd begun to make a name for himself as a reliable meth vendor he discovered Australia, just like I did.
Meth goes for as much as $600 a gram in some parts of aus, so the demand for inexpensive american meth is almost unfathomable to somebody unfamiliar with the market.
Anyway, USPS to aus is fucking awful. I personally had two orders to the same buyer/drop, one first class mail and the other priority mail express international, show up within hours of each other.
FedEx is way better, but it's a private courrier - making it very difficult to send packages anonymously (liability reasons, since they're a private company unlike usps).
I don't have much experience with FedEx to aus but I know that when all goes according to plan it's fucking incredible. NYC to Perth is 4 days awesome, unheard of with USPS.
So, hammertime was making a killing selling meth in the states, and had begun to expand into the gaping maw-like profit margins of the aus market.
He disguised his packages as legal documents, from a real law firm in the united states. I don't know if he actually had access to their fedex account (authorized or otherwise) or if he just used their real business location as a return address, but after some time something went wrong. If I recall correctly, it didn't even have anything to do with australian customs (notoriously nosy fuckers as many of you already know), even they don't want to fuck with lawyers.. Some little thing happened, like the guy who made this particular order freaked out and wouldn't sign for it, or the address was fake, or an abandoned house.. something that wouldn't normally cause anything more than a 1/5 feedback. But in this instance, because fedex is actually an efficient courier service, when the error (whatever it was) was discovered, the "documents" were promptly returned to the real law firm, that the "documents" allegedly came from. If I remember correctly, this is one of those gigantic SUPER evil law fims that defend multi-billion dollar companies when they get sued for giving ecuadorian toddlers cancer or what have you. Well not evil, but I'm sure they have enough enemies. Now, this international package is returned to them, and at some point some secretary opens it up to try and figure out where it was supposed to go and why, almost immediately discovering about two ounces of a mysterious white substance.
ANTHRAX, is the immediate assumption that is made, not recognizing the ground shards as methamphetamine. As soon as the word "anthrax" is uttered, DHS and every other big scary three letter government organization gets involved. They soon realize it is not anthrax but actually crystal methamphetamine, but it's too late for them to be distracted at this point. Within a week they've obtained security footage of HT sending that exact parcel at a fedex store, and if they hadn't figured out who it was yet, I assume they just traced the card he paid with. And that was game over for HT.
TLDR: Lawyers + DHS + Fear of Anthrax = stuff of nightmares.
Disclaimer: This is my best atempt to recall 2nd hand memories and I'm sure there are a few inaccuracies in need of correction, but it's the best I can recall. -->

On 26 January 2014, the Bitcoin seller "BTCKing" ([SR1](/docs/sr/btcking-profile-1.htm)/[2](/docs/sr/btcking-profile-2.htm)) & an accomplice at [BitInstant](!Wikipedia) were arrested in Florida & NY (respectively) after an IRS investigation ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January14/SchremFaiellaChargesPR/Faiella,%20Robert%20M.%20and%20Charlie%20Shrem%20Complaint.pdf)); BTCKing offered a service in which he sent buyers a bank account number to deposit cash to (which he then converted into bitcoins via BitInstant), then transferred bitcoins to the buyer on Silk Road.
He was arrested after an undercover agent (starting in August 2012) made purchases, received the bank account information, and obtained his bank records; the case was further cemented by using the SR messages from the FBI's copy of the servers (apparently BTCKing did not believe in using PGP), the home IP embedded in BTCKing's emails with BitInstant (BTCKing used Safe-mail.net but apparently did not connect over Tor), and his accomplice's Gmail emails & chats obtained.
(Ironically, BTCKing had declined Dread Pirate Robert's July 2013 invitation to join him in creating an "Anonymous Bitcoin Exchange" by pointing out his vulnerability to investigation: "All LE has to do is go to the bank and ask who is the Trustee of RMF Trust and BANG... They will seize the funds and me.")
He pled guilty and was [sentenced to 4 years](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January15/RobertFaiellaSentencingPR.php "Bitcoin Exchanger Sentenced In Manhattan Federal Court To Four Years In Prison For Selling Nearly $1 Million In Bitcoins For Drug Buys On Silk Road")

In late May 2014, the SR1 oxycodone/hydrocodone seller "CALIGIRL" ([profile](/docs/sr/caligirl-profile.htm)), Matthew Jones, was [arrested in Dallas, Texas](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-05-30/news/os-silk-road-arrest-matthew-jones-20140530_1_dea-agents-painkillers-website) ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/May/20140530_Jones.html), [criminal complaint](http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/May/20140530_Jones_Complaint.pdf) & [excerpts](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2c2i3f/caligirl_criminal_complaint_excerpts/), [PACER](/docs/sr/2014-07-29-pacer-caligirl.maff)), pled guilty, and was [sentenced to 5 years & ten months](http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/Dec/20141218_Jones.html "Texas Business Executive Sentenced To Prison For Illegally Selling Oxycodone On Silk Road").
An undercover agent had made 2 purchases through SR1 and 6 over Bitmessage after the SR1 bust; CALIGIRL did not vary packaging methods or drop off location, allowing his packages to be profiled, traced back to a sorting facility, where the agent discovered they were all dropped off at a single postal box.
In addition, on the last purchase, the agent social-engineered CALIGIRL into accepting part of the payment to his personal bank account.
This all fed into a comprehensive investigation of CALIGIRL's life which drew on information from (but likely not exclusive to):
Facebook; Amazon shopping logs and IP; `#bitcoin-otc` IP & transactions; Local Bitcoin transactions; domain names and telephone; cellphone apps (Ding) usage & callers & IPs; Post Office photos (from automated postal machine); the landlord for his post box; travel records; electronic toll records recording movements of his car; hotels he stayed at (he used places he stayed or was near as return addresses); and financial records from: Xoom (and IP addresses), Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Western Union, & MoneyGram.
There are currently no known controlled deliveries or arrests of CALIGIRL customers (possibly the SR1 bust eliminated most of his business).

## Silk Road 2 (SR2)

In early May 2014, the SR2 seller ["Xanax King" & his associates](http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_25861423/contra-costa-nine-charged-massive-xanax-drug-operation) [were arrested](http://patch.com/california/martinez/xanax-king-of-martinez-among-9-charged-with-making-counterfeit-drugs-laundering-money "'Xanax King' Of Martinez Among 9 Charged With Making Counterfeit Drugs, Laundering Money: Nine people were indicted by a federal grand jury in Oakland on charges of manufacturing counterfeit prescription drugs, money laundering or both.") ([DEA press release](http://www.justice.gov/dea/divisions/sf/2014/sf053014.shtml)); he ran a very large operation with multiple employees, purchased ingredients using Western Union & wire transfers to China, "sold drugs locally, distributing Xanax tablets, GHB, and steroids", some sort of clearnet website ([`xkloves.us`](http://www.xkloves.us), content removed in lieu of a now-defunct Tor hidden service), and had at least one "confidential informant" in his organization (see the [anti-bail letter](/docs/sr/2014-06-25-xanaxking-antibailletter-cand035011914356.pdf)), who was handling their SR2 orders at the end according to a [media report](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/9418693-171/feds-use-facebook-to-id "Feds use Facebook to ID man tied to Xanax conspiracy: Authorities say man rammed DEA vehicle after getting package") (some buyers reported being [asked to resend](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/26w0qe/busted_xanaxking/chv2yw0) their PGP-encrypted addresses).

The fall out from XK's bust has been substantial: the anti-bail letter claims "In addition to the nine defendants in this case, evidence gathered from Defendant's enterprise led to the arrest of nearly 60 other people throughout the country".
Several of his customers received controlled deliveries and have been arrested as well.
2 controlled deliveries on 28 May picked up [4 men in Bloomington, Indiana](http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2014/05/police-recover-approximately-15000.php "Police Recover Approximately 15,000 Xanax Pills") (Carlos Matthew Allen, David Christian Feigel, Paul Furto, & Andrew C. Dickey).
[Kory D. Kreider in New Orleans, Louisiana](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/9418693-171/feds-use-facebook-to-id "Feds use Facebook to ID man tied to Xanax conspiracy: Authorities say man rammed DEA vehicle after getting package") whose pickup of a package was surveilled managed to evade arrest on 29 May but was arrested a few days later using cellphone records & Facebook data.
Some other CDs in late May/early June 2014 are highly likely to be XK-related.
In Naperville, Illinois, [Brian Patrick Noone was arrested on 30 May 2014](http://ilinnews.com/naperville-man-arrested-after-police-find-600-xanax-pills/ "Naperville man arrested after police find 600 Xanax pills") after a search warrant yielded 600 Xanax pills, apparently based on "a tip from a federal task force about drug trafficking in Naperville".
<!-- TODO: followup: Brian Patrick Noone not in PACER; charged in Will County; requested an affidavit through https://www.i2file.net/ -->
In Nashville, Tennessee, 3 people (Demarcus Blue, Markuite Matthews, & Adrevious Rayner) [were arrested after a CD on 29 May 2014](http://www.wsmv.com/story/25667210/metro-police-seize "Metro police seize 21,000 Xanax pills") of [5000 gel cap Xanax pills](http://wsmv.images.worldnow.com/images/25667210_BG4.jpg) sent by a "An alleged drug ring" shipping from California and the mailer ["was taken into custody at the end of last week"](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2014/06/01/xanax-pills-seized-hermitage/9847299/ "5,000 Xanax pills seized in Hermitage").

On 5 November 2014, as the final piece of Operation Onymous, the operator of Silk Road 2, Blake Benthall / "Defcon" was arrested in San Francisco ([press release](http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2014/operator-of-silk-road-2.0-website-charged-in-manhattan-federal-court); [complaint](/docs/sr/sr2-blakebenthall-complaint.pdf)).
It is highly likely that the undercover agent Cirrus had enabled the locating of the SR2 server, which Benthall apparently had rented  under his own name (possibly at his employer Close's hosting), after which his Bitcoin spending (on a Tesla) was noted and surveillance correlated Defcon's activities with Benthall's; after being arrested, he ["did admit to everything"](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/prosecutor-silk-road-2-0-suspect-did-admit-to-everything/).

On 6 November 2014, David & Teri Schell were [arrested in California](http://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/durham-couple-indicted-as-part-of-silk-road-2-0-crackdown/ "Durham couple indicted as part of Silk Road 2.0 crackdown") for selling marijuana and marijuana wax ([complaint](/docs/sr/2014-11-20-californiacanbis.pdf), [PACER](/docs/sr/2014-11-20-blackmarkets-schell.maff)); [additional coverage](http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/NorCal-couple-ensnared-in-dark-Web-drug-site-5907946.php "Butte County couple ensnared in Silk Road 2.0 drug case") indicated they were investigated after "discovering an Internet Protocol address was accessing the Silk Road 2.0 site" and then PO box surveillance nailed them.
The DoctorClu case reveals that the vendor portal for SR2 had been used to de-anonymize a few IPs (but not many), implying that an undercover agent (presumably Cirrus) had inserted a de-anonymization exploit similar to the previous Freedom Hosting exploit.
They were probably the SR1 & SR2 seller "CaliforniaCanibas" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/7058d46a86.htm)).

The Washington man Brian Farrell & SR2 staffer "DoctorClu" was [arrested 20 January 2015](http://koin.com/ap/alleged-manager-of-silk-road-2-0-website-arrested/); his IP had been uncovered in July 2014 accessing the SR2 seller portal[^DoctorClu-IP], like CaliforniaCanibas.
The [local police investigated](http://www.bellevuereporter.com/news/288854101.html) by post-office checks and then interviewing him & his roommate, who spoke freely about Farrell's drug use and online connections, allowing [a search warrant](/docs/sr/2015-01-07-kingcountysuperiorcourt-brianfarrell-searchwarrantaffidavit.pdf) to uncover Farrell's prescription drugs, at which point he confessed everything & to helping run SR2 as the employee DoctorClu and was then arrested (the charges being upgraded from local pill charges to [federal conspiracy charges](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2918824/U-S-charges-man-says-linked-Silk-Road-successor-site-drug-scheme.html); [complaint](/docs/sr/brianfarrell-federalcomplaint.pdf))

[^DoctorClu-IP]: From the search warrant:

    > ...From January 2014 to July 2014, a FBI NY Source of Information (SOI) provided reliable IP addresses for TOR and hidden services such as SR2, which included its main marketplace URL (`silkroad6ownfk.onion`), its vendor URL (`vx3w763ohd256iyh.onion`), its forum URL (`silkroad5v7dywlc.onion`) and its support interface (`uz434sei7arqunp6.onion`). The SOI's information ultimately led to the identification of SR2 servers, which led to the identification of at least seventeen black markets on TOR.
    >
    > The SOI also identified approximately 78 IP addresses that accessed a vendor .onion address. A user cannot accidently end up on the vendor site. The site is for vendors only, and access is only given to the site by the SR2 administrators/moderators after confirmation of a significant number of successful transactions. If a user visits the vendor URL, he or she is asked for a user name and password. Without a user name and password, the vendor web site cannot be viewed.
    >
    > Current Investigation
    >
    > On July 30, 2014, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Seattle received information that a user associated with IP address 67.182.142.24 accessed the vendor portal of SR2. Records reveal the IP address was associated with a Comcast internet account registered to Steve Phelps at 4238 163rd Avenue SE - Bellevue, WA 98006. On August 8, 2014, the Washington Department of Licensing reported the following vehicle and driver information for that address:... On August 13, 2014, Homeland Security Investigations initiated surveillance activities on the above address, further observing the blue Volkswagen Beetle, and the white Chevrolet Camero...On October 10, 2014, Homeland Security investigations, assisted by a U.S. Postal Inspector, visited several U.S. Post Offices near 4238 163rd Avenue SE, Bellevue, WA 98006...Another employee at the same location recognized the photograph of Steve Phelps, further stating he may have dropped off a tub of letters for mailing and he drove a blue station wagon... [and so on through to pg9, then the rest seems to be search warrant boilerplate]

### Israel

An [Israeli man Weitzman](http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4611084,00.html "חשד: הזמין שוקולד עם קוקאין ברשת האפלה :צעיר מכפר סבא חשוד שהזמין קוקאין דרך ה'דארקנט', והסם הגיע ארצה בתוך פרלינים. קו ההגנה שלו: 'בכלל הזמנתי סמי הזיה שאינם אסורים בחוק'") was arrested ~4 January 2015 after a "darknet" package containing cocaine was detected by a sniffer dog at Customs.

An Israeli teen [was arrested ~12 January 2015](http://news.walla.co.il/item/2819632 "חשד: רכש סמים ב'ביטקוין'ומכר אותם בתיכון באשדוד: חבילה שעוררה את חשדם של הבודקים בנתב'ג הכילה מאות גרמים של מריחואנה - והובילה לבן 18 שקיבל יותר מ-10 חבילות של סמים שונים. החשוד למד בשיטוט באינטרנט כיצד לרכוש סמים ברשת 'דארקנט' המוצפנת") ([translation](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/01/14/israeli-teen-arrested/)) after a package of marijuana was intercepted by Customs at Ben Gurion Airport; the media coverage specifies he had bought that package & 13 others off the black-markets, but not which one or the seller.

### New Zealand (NZ)

A 21 June 2014 [_Dominion Post_](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/10185845/People-next-door-buying-drugs-online "'People next door' buying drugs online") article says that " A series of drug raids in a police operation spanning Porirua, Tawa, the Kapiti Coast and Hutt Valley and central Wellington resulted in 21 arrests over the past week [15-20 June 2014]. Six of those arrested now face serious charges related to the alleged importation of drugs bought online from websites similar to Silk Road." (This is a revised figure from the [earlier article on "Operation Python"](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/10177294/Police-bust-drugs-ring-find-stolen-carving "Police bust drugs ring, find stolen carving") which had mentioned that "Six Kapiti houses were raided and five arrests made as part of a large police sting targeting internet drug importers.")
I currently do not know the specifics of those 6 arrests or have any NZ cases in that date range.

### USA

On 20 June 2014, the Boise Idaho buyer Jasen Crisp received a CD of a package of MDMA he had ordered from Canada ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao-id/pr/boise-man-admits-importing-ecstasy-united-states), case 1:14-cr-00226-EJL) and cooperated; his lawyer's [sentencing filing](/docs/sr/2015-01-29-jasencrisp-defensesentencingletter.pdf) writes that he used an "electronic currency" to use the "uncommon means" of ordering on the Internet from "a secret marketplace", so Crisp clearly ordered off one of the black-markets, but it remains unclear which market and which seller.

At the same time as Operation Onymous, the [FBI raided a home in West Haven, Connecticut](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/multimedia/walthandelsman/10766235-171/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home) [~6 November 2014](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/10766235-123/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home); it is unknown whether anyone was arrested or what market they may have been associated with.
(Speculation so far has only suggested the Agora seller "Nawlins".)

The FBI also [raided a New Orleans, Louisiana](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/10766235-123/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home "FBI raid of Marigny home part of global crackdown on 'Dark Web'") 6 November 2014, but similarly nothing is known about the results.

The original [Operation Onymous press release](http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-11-07.aspx) boasted of 17 arrests, involving LE from "Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA" (["the arrests were scattered over the US and Europe."](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/silk-road-20-operation-onymous-dark-web-drugs-takedown)); not all of these are market-connected as they could also be related to scam sites, vendor shops, or running content sites (doxbins, revenge porn, etc) and the original releases counted seized websites [in the most inflated way possible](https://www.nikcub.com/posts/onymous-part1/ "Large Number of Tor Hidden Sites Seized by the FBI in Operation Onymous were Clone or Scam Sites"):

1. Blake Benthall; San Francisco, California USA; SR2 operator
2. ???; West Haven, Connecticut USA; ???
3. ???; New Orleans, Louisiana USA; ???
4. ???; Budapest, Hungary; Hydra operator
5. David Schell; California USA; SR2 seller CaliforniaCanabis (the press release is dated 2014-11-07, and the Schells seem to have been arrested the day before, 2014-11-06, so they are probably included in the count)
6. Teri Schell; California USA; SR2 seller CaliforniaCanabis
7. ???; Switzerland; [operator of the scam site "Black Market"](http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/Le-FBI-fait-interpeller-un-Vaudois-chez-lui/story/24253596 "Le FBI fait interpeller un Vaudois chez lui Darknet: Un informaticien est accusé d'avoir créé un site de vente d'armes, de drogues et de faux papiers.")
8. ???; Barcelona Spain; [seems to have been the operator of a scam site](http://www.guardiacivil.es/es/prensa/noticias/5146.html "La Guardia Civil detiene a uno de los objetivos de la macro operación ONYMOUS contra los mercados clandestinos en la Deep Web") ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2m3eyo/some_onymous_bust_in_spain/)) claiming to sell carding-related goods, perhaps "Super Note Counter" or "Sol's Unified USD Counterfeit's" or "Fast Cash!" (all named in the [Operation Onymous seizure papers](/docs/sr/20141107-operationonymous-seizureforfeiture.pdf))

> The investigation, nicknamed Operation Onymous, targeted mostly sellers and deactivated upward of 50 websites like Silk Road 2.0, Mr. Quid's Forum, Paypal Center, Cannabis Road Markets and Blue Sky, according to Europol...The operation was led by American agencies - the F.B.I. and Homeland Security Investigations - and coordinated by Europol in the various European countries with raids that started on Wednesday and Thursday but blossomed into a broad sweep by Friday. Working in English as a common language, investigators made arrests in Eastern and Western Europe, including France, Germany, Spain, and England.

On 6 January 2015, the [Princeton student Julian Edgren was arrested](http://planetprinceton.com/2015/01/07/princeton-university-student-arrested-for-drug-possession/ "Princeton University Student Arrested for Drug Possession") after a CD package of MDMA; warrants also turned up psilocybin, marijuana, LSD, hashish, and Adderall.
It is known Edgren had been a The Marketplace customer, but TMP had closed down months before January 2015 after Operation Onymous, so he could not have been using TMP for that order.
(The pricing [might suggest a Canadian source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2robda/possibly_dnm_related_buyer_arrest/cnif309).)

# Unconfirmed rumors

Sending drugs through the mail turns out to be a surprisingly common practice, and there are many cases of people being busted for receiving packages of drugs (particularly with the rise of marijuana legalization in American states), sometimes through online mechanisms (eg Instagram).
The [Drugs Global Incident Map](http://drugs.globalincidentmap.com/) features many online-related busts, and long lists can be compiled from law enforcement press releases & local news media.[^Reddit-lists-1][^Reddit-lists-2]

Most are likely unrelated to the black-markets, and some rumors are wrong or flatly made up (for example, a seller may be covering up an exit scam with a fake story about being busted, or one seller may be trying to hurt another's sales eg [the TedDanzig incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1xq97t/teddanzig_arrested/)), but of course, some will turn out to be real.

## Australia

A [Reddit user in March 2014](https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/20akta/police_asking_for_statement/) claims that he was approached by police using information from an unspecified SR1 seller being prosecuted. No confirmation.

The [Agora seller Ripefreefly](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/24zt2o/ripefreefly_busted_or_scam_what_do_i_do/) reportedly claimed in May 2014 on his vendor page to have been busted and was pleading guilty; his story has some issues and I have seen no confirmation.

On 26 August 2014, a ["cook"/underground-lab for steroids was busted in Australia](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2esz2q/all_markets_ugloz_busted_by_feds/ck2ttbn); this may have been the supplier for the SR2 steroids seller "UGLOZ" and related to why UGLOZ apparently began scamming in early August according to the [SR2F](/docs/sr/sr2f-20140831-uglozcomplaintthread.html "*****BEWARE***** UGLOZ ***** SCAMMERS *****").

## Israel

On 5 July 2013, [Israeli police announced 30 arrests](http://www.police.gov.il/articlePage.aspx?aid=1587 "30 נעצרו בחשד שסחרו בסמים מסוכנים ברשת: במהלך החקירה הסמויה ביצעו החוקרים קניות מבוימות מאתרים שונים בהם השתמשו החשודים, לצורך הסחר בסמים"); Google Translate indicates that these arrests were related to online sellers of "dangerous drugs" using the "darknet" and possibly Bitcoins after Israeli law enforcement made undercover purchases, but no market is specified and it seems hard to believe that as many as 30 people could be busted without any notice being taken on SR1/BMR (the main markets in July 2013).

## New Zealand (NZ)

A [Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNZ/comments/2tdk8a/custom_bust_5_tabs_of_lsd/) claims on 22 January 2015 to have, "a few months ago" ordered LSD from Canada, which was intercepted and been sweated by Customs.

[Daniel Patrick McKechnie, Taine Mita Piriru Edwards, & Mitchell Charles Connor-Dagg](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/332105/trio-serious-drug-charges "Trio on serious drug charges") (aged 18-20) were arrested & charged in February 2015 after customs interceptions with importing, from November 2014-January 2015, LSD/MDMA/methamphetamine which ["had all been sourced through the internet from the United States and Europe in a sophisticated operation"](http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/police-bust-dunedin-drug-ring-2015020423 "Police bust Dunedin drug ring "). (Possibly linked to the [Evolution seller "TheWireNz"'s apparently-permanent vacation](https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNZ/comments/2ti2qd/temp_closing/)?)

## UK

There is an anonymous claim of a May 2013 [UK controlled delivery & arrest](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ewt7k/uk_arrest/).
([Possibly ketamine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/273gjq/controlled_delivery_in_the_uk/chxhr2x)?)

Similarly, [one Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ewt7k/uk_arrest/) claims on 23 May 2013 that an acquaintance was CDed 22 May 2013 for an international package of pills ordered from SR1.

[A Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2gwej3/true_cases_of_small_time_buyers_being_arrested/ckn7imx) claimed on 19 September 2014 that the British man [John Watt](http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/carlisle-man-who-had-ecstasy-tablets-sent-to-friend-s-house-jailed-1.1061538) & friend who were arrested for a package of MDMA from Holland had ordered it off SR1.

[A Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2juko5/interways_raid_by_police/) claims in early October 2014 to have been raided after buying MDMA & "speed" from Interways off SR2.

A [Reddit rumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2vn7tt/vendor_busted/) claims a "big" Evolution marijuana seller was arrested 10 February 2015 (possibly Newport, Skyvype, or Hera).

## USA

A [pseudonymous Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o6whp/attention_i_just_made_bail_as_a_buyer/ccpnnh7) claims to have been arrested & charged over SR1 cocaine sometime in 2012, but not convicted.

On 19 March 2014, in Leesburg Virginia, Thomas C. Watson [was arrested after a controlled delivery](http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/25055460/police-man-allegedly-used-mail-to-transport-drug-molly "Police: Man allegedly used mail to transport drug "molly" to himself") of an intercepted package of oxycodone & MDMA; he wrote ["return to sender" on it & denied any connection](http://www.leesburgtoday.com/crime/leesburg-man-denies-involvement-in-mailed-drugs-case/article_e6a17896-b6a4-11e3-b6b2-001a4bcf887a.html "Leesburg Man Denies Involvement In Mailed Drugs Case"), and ultimately [the charges were dropped](http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/drug_charges_dropped_against_prominent_leesburg_businessman543 "Drug charges dropped against prominent Leesburg businessman").
Because of his technological savvy ("the founder of Capital Computers and Network, an IT company"; cf CALIGIRL) and return-to-sender gambit (sometimes advised as an anti-CD tactic) and the small quantities (suggesting a personal purchase rather than being set up as a drop), speculation was rife that Watson was a black-market buyer, but no concrete evidence ever surfaced.

In February 2015, UCF student [Peter John Faucella was arrested in Florida](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ucf-student-marijuana-arrest-towers-20150216-story.html "UCF student had marijuana shipped to campus apartment, cops say") after an intercepted package of marijuana; previously, a UCF student [may have posted on the black-market subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2w52bg/communitydiscussionucf_students_busted_for/copb9se) asking for help.
