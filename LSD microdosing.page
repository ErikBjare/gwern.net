> Some early experimental studies with LSD suggested that doses of LSD too small to cause any noticeable effects may improve mood and creativity. Prompted by recent discussion of this claim and the purely anecdotal subsequent evidence for it, I decided to run a well-powered randomized blind trial of 3-day LSD microdoses from September 2012 to March 2013. No beneficial effects reached statistical-significance and there were worrisome negative trends. LSD microdosing did not help me.

Intrigued by old scientific results & many positive anecdotes since, I experimented with "microdosing" [LSD](!Wikipedia "Lysergic acid diethylamide") - taking doses ~10Î¼g, far below the level at which it causes its famous effects. At this level, the anecdotes claim the usual broad spectrum of positive effects on mood, depression, ability to do work, etc. After researching the matter a bit, I discovered that as far as I could tell, since the original experiment in the 1960s, no one had ever done a blind or even a randomized self-experiment on it.

The self-experiment was simple: I ordered two tabs off Silk Road, dissolved one in distilled water, put the solution in one jar & tap water in the other, and took them in pairs of 3-day blocks.

The results of my pre-specified analysis on a well-powered randomized blind self-experiment:

1. Sleep:

    - latency: none (_p_=0.42)
    - total sleep: none (_p_=0.14)
    - number of awakenings: none (_p_=0.36)
    - morning feel: increased (_p_=0.02)

        There is an increase in "Morning Feel" from 2.6 to 2.9, _d_=0.42 & _p_=0.023; correcting for performing 7 different tests, this result is not statistically-significant (it does not survive a [Bonferroni correction](!Wikipedia) (since $0.0231 > \frac{0.05}{7}$) nor the [_q_-value approach](Zeo#fn7) to family-wise correction).
2. Mnemosyne flashcard scores: none (_p_=0.52)
3. Mood/productivity: none (_d_=-0.18; _p_=0.86)
4. Creativity: none (_d_=-0.19; _p_=0.87)

I concluded that if anything, the LSD microdosing may done the opposite of what I wanted.

# Background

I've long been interested in psychedelics for the insights they may offer into our brains:

> "...When I did 2 hits of acid, I had the exact opposite experience of seeing God. The fact that such a tiny amount of a mere chemical could effect my 'soul' so profoundly was proof positive that the soul is completely material. I already believed this intellectually, but this experience solidified this knowledge into my very being. So personally, I would recommended experimenting with a psychedelic or two for those who wish to study Philosophy." --[darius42](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5210978)

But I'd never actually tried any. Besides being illegal and relatively expensive or hard to get, proponents have been clear that a "good trip" requires someone experienced to watch over you and an appropriate environment - neither of which I had available. So it'd always been something to do later, and pure curiosity about the experience was not enough to break my inertia.

I say "curiosity about the experience" because I am dubious about the actual epistemic value of the psychedelic experience; my interest, like [William James](http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/96may/nitrous/nitrous.htm "The Nitrous Oxide Philosopher: Do drugs make religious experience possible? They did for James and for other philosopher-mystics of his day. James's experiments with psychoactive drugs raise difficult questions about belief and its conditions"), is in what I can learn from the experience about myself and religion. The claims made by psychonauts are frequently extravagant and unjustified; the tangible benefits are either unrelated to the truth of the experience (such as lessened anxiety of death), purely internal (what one wants to do with one's life), or true but unrelated to the claims inferred from the experience and verifiable in a non-psychedelic context (the invention of [PCR](!Wikipedia)). If one feels at one with everything in the universe and decides to devote his life to feeding starving children, his devotion to charity proves nothing about the universe, and even if the experience were true at face-value, that would not be enough either - if one felt the opposite, that the universe were not one, would that somehow make the starving children OK? [Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/drugs-and-the-meaning-of-life "'Drugs and the Meaning of Life', 5 July 2011") takes an approach very much like mine:

> The mere existence of psychedelics would seem to establish the material basis of mental and spiritual life beyond any doubt - for the introduction of these substances into the brain is the obvious cause of any numinous apocalypse that follows. It is possible, however, if not actually plausible, to seize this datum from the other end and argue, and Aldous Huxley did in his classic essay, _The Doors of Perception_, that the primary function of the brain could be eliminative: its purpose could be to prevent some vast, transpersonal dimension of mind from flooding consciousness, thereby allowing apes like ourselves to make their way in the world without being dazzled at every step by visionary phenomena irrelevant to their survival. Huxley thought that if the brain were a kind of "reducing valve" for "Mind at Large," this would explain the efficacy of psychedelics: They could simply be a material means of opening the tap.
>
> ...Unfortunately, Huxley was operating under the erroneous assumption that psychedelics decrease brain activity. However, modern techniques of neuroimaging have shown that these drugs tend to increase activity in many regions of the cortex (and in subcortical structures as well) [Note 1/24/12: a recent study on psilocybin actually lends some support to Huxley's view. --SH] . Still, the action of these drugs does not rule out dualism, or the existence of realms of mind beyond the brain-but then nothing does. This is one of the problems with views of this kind: They appear to be unfalsifiable.[3]
>
> Of course, the brain does filter an extraordinary amount of information from consciousness. And, like many who have taken these drugs, I can attest that psychedelics certainly throw open the gates. Needless to say, positing the existence of a "Mind at Large" is more tempting in some states of consciousness than in others. And the question of which view of reality we should privilege is, at times, worth considering. But these drugs can also produce mental states that are best viewed in clinical terms as forms of psychosis. As a general matter, I believe we should be very slow to make conclusions about the nature of the cosmos based upon inner experience - no matter how profound these experiences seem.

The potential "mystical experience" or "encounter with God" has considerable interest for me, though. Even back when I was a very young child, I have always been [some sort of atheist](Mistakes#religion); at first, because it didn't seem like a very good explanation of the world, but then because my reading of various scriptures and Biblical criticism and philosophy books revealed no convincing arguments to me. I always wondered whether my disbelief was due to *reasoned grounds* as I claimed, or a simple lack of the right *experiences*: other people seem to have mystical experiences and find prayer satisfactory and believe fervently, and I sporadically hear of [converts](!Wikipedia "List of converts to Christianity from atheism") who have "road to Damascus" experiences (like SF author [John C. Wright](!Wikipedia "John C. Wright (author)") hallucinating and converting to Catholicism [after a heart attack](http://johncwright.livejournal.com/117818.html)). Sporadic hallucinations are a poor ground for belief, as a mental hospital demonstrates, but nevertheless they are quite convincing; it seems that for many, seeing really is believing. Many years later, I have yet to have a mystical or religious or ["peak"](!Wikipedia "Peak experience") experience which could either convert me or leave me unmoved, and thus empirically settle the issue as to why I am an atheist - absence of experience, or reasoned belief? Hence, it is tempting to force the issue. (If you have a psilocybin-induced hallucination of God and then become a theist, that's a good piece of evidence that stuff like the argument from evil or argument from silence *weren't* why you were an atheist. And so if you were claiming previously that they were, you were either lying or badly mistaken.) [Thomas Nagel](!Wikipedia): (["A Philosopher Defends Religion"](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/philosopher-defends-religion/?pagination=false))

> It is illuminating to have the starkness of the opposition between [Plantinga's](!Wikipedia "Alvin Plantinga") theism and the secular outlook so clearly explained. My instinctively atheistic perspective implies that if I ever found myself flooded with the conviction that what the [Nicene Creed](!Wikipedia) says is true, the most likely explanation would be that I was losing my mind, not that I was being granted the gift of faith. From Plantinga's point of view, by contrast, I suffer from a kind of spiritual blindness from which I am unwilling to be cured. http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/philosopher-defends-religion/?pagination=false

Everything I've heard or read is consistent with what such experiences seem to be: the brain in a very unusual state, malfunctioning in many respects and perhaps functioning better in a few other respects. No one expects to discover a new truth about the universe in the throes of _delirium tremens_ or amphetamine psychosis - isn't it parsimonious to extend this to psychedelics as well? If there were some 'truthiness' to the states, I had to think: of the many thousands of mind-altering substances investigated over the centuries, it would be quite remarkable if the few which grant access to new truths were also the very same ones which produce pleasant or enjoyable trips!

So the trip itself is of little direct value, but the 3 categories of effects I outlined are. Everyone talks about Openness (see later) and creativity in relation to psychedelics. I would offer a more concrete analogy: creativity is a kind of optimization activity like [simulated annealing](!Wikipedia) in which one searches through a vast number of possibilities for the right thing. (This seems to be similar to [James L. Kent's views](https://www.erowid.org/library/review/review.php?p=317 "Review: _Psychedelic Information Theory: Shamanism in the Age of Reason_, by James L. Kent").) In simulated annealing, we can think of the possibilities as a [fitness landscape](!Wikipedia) dotted with mountains and valleys, and we are trying to find the lowest point; we start at random points, and jump around randomly and see how low we wind up. How big are our jumps? This is the "temperature". The temperature starts high, since we may be a very long way away from the lowest point, but as we get lower and closer to the sea, we turn down the temperature and start making small jumps so we don't jump right back onto a mountain or something like that. (Imagine looking through a dictionary: you flip through whole chunks to get the letter right, then you start flipping through pages so you don't overshoot, and finally you read through an individual page.) The temperature has to change, or we will waste a lot of time and may never find our target: if the temperature is always high, no sooner have we found an excellent candidate than we have jumped half a continent away, but if it's always low, we will literally inch around and not find the low point a few miles away. Simulated annealing itself has been applied to neural networks, so it may be more than just an analogy to say our brains do something similar. At first you brainstorm, generating myriads of disparate ideas, but you focus on a few candidates, brainstorm variants, and begin carefully fine-tuning them. You hope you don't spend too much time tinkering that you miss your deadline, but also that you don't spend too little time brainstorming that you miss some brilliant elegant solution.

And LSD? Perhaps doses large enough that you become so 'creative' that you start seeing what is not there are analogous to turning the temperature up a thousand degrees: the frantic annealing may hit upon some remote undiscovered great idea (eg. PCR) but this will usually just throw away all one's current good results in favor of some random dreck. Genuine thought and breakthroughs are the pinnacle of human thought, achieved after endless labor and dependent on many dead-ends, bits of knowledge, and intuited truths; randomness seems like it would usually make things much worse[^Charlton], and in general, pharmacological interventions [have little luck improving things](Drug heuristics). Think of dreams: 4 or 5 a night, hugely random - and only occasionally if ever do they deliver real insight or a valid idea. Isn't it a standard joke that you discover the secret of the universe or the perfect song in a dream, wake up & write it down, and in the morning it is worthless? It's probably no accident that dreams so rarely produce useful insights and also parts of the brain - particularly parts of the prefrontal cortex - are [shut down](DNB FAQ#lucid-dreaming) or operating differently.

[^Charlton]: [Bruce Charlton](!Wikipedia) in [_Psychiatry and the Human Condition_](http://www.amazon.com/Psychiatry-Human-Condition-Bruce-Charlton/dp/1857753143/) on psychedelics:

    > Creativity is here seen [by psychedelic proponents] as something to be liberated. It is sometimes claimed that by rendering apparently peak experiences more common and controllable, drugs may allow the attainment of a 'higher' form of human evolution. Sorry to be boring, but: Evolutionary theory takes exactly the opposite view to [Aldous] Huxley - instead of humans 'naturally' knowing everything and evolving the ability to experience less; biology sees the starting point in insentient, inert matter and regards the capacity to perceive anything at all as having evolved gradually over many millions of years. Knowledge is certainly not out there waiting to burst in on our minds as soon as intoxication lets it through. Rather, the capacity to attain knowledge, to perceive, and to be aware of our perceptions, are all adaptations that have been painstakingly constructed over an evolutionary timescale. Neither is scientific creativity spontaneous, natural or pre-formed; it is attained by constructive human striving - something made, not a spontaneous fact of nature. No scientific breakthroughs have ever come from ignorant and uneducated prodigies who happened to be intoxicated. Neither does creativity in science emerge like a beautiful butterfly breaking from a chrysalis of social convention, rather it is something constructed by efforts and gifts (and luck) - including the efforts and gifts of colleagues. Science requires knowledge and skill as well as the right state of mind.

But it never happened again." --[Stanislaw Ulam](!Wikipedia)^[January 14, 1974, in "Conversations with Gian-Carlo Rota"; as quoted on pg262  of [_Turing's Cathedral_](http://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998/) (2012) by [George Dyson](!Wikipedia "George Dyson (science historian)")]

# Microdosing

But if we turned up the temperature just a few degrees, we *might* wind up burning our cake, but then again we might cook it to perfection. Theoretical speculation, of course, but with some plausibility to it.

The [old research literature](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose1.shtml "Abstracts regarding low doses of LSD (Less than 50Î¼g)") is mixed but suggests that LSD doesn't do much under 20Î¼g. Nonetheless, when I read ["The Heretic"](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-heretic) about [James Fadiman](http://www.jamesfadiman.com/)'s ideas about "micro-dosing" and an [earlier interview](http://www.bestofyoutoday.com/ask-nutrition-expert/learn-what-effects-low-dosage-psychedelic-have-your-mental-health), and that it seemed to work well for a variety of people, the old musings came back to mind. A normal LSD dose is 100Î¼g+, and a micro-dose 10Î¼g. This brings micro-doses into the sub-hallucinatory range, and removes most of my safety concerns ("the dose makes the poison"). Certainly it sounds good:

> "Micro-dosing turns out to be a totally different world," Fadiman extolled. "As someone said, the rocks don't glow, even a little bit. But what many people are reporting is, at the end of the day, they say, 'That was a really good day.' You know, that kind of day when things kind of work. You're doing a task you normally couldn't stand for two hours, but you do it for three or four. You eat properly. Maybe you do one more set of reps. Just a good day. That seems to be what we're discovering." Elsewhere Fadiman has been more specific about the logbooks he's received. One physician reported that micro-dosing got him "in touch with a deep place of ease and beauty." A vocalist said she could better hear and channel music. In general, study participants functioned normally in their work and relationships, Fadiman has said, but with increased focus, creativity, and emotional clarity. Until he releases his data archive in a comprehensive manner, it is, of course, not possible to scrutinize the validity of his claim..."I just got a report from someone who did this for six weeks," Fadiman said. "And his question to me was, 'Is there any reason to stop?'" More laughter throughout the hall, another adjustment of bifocals...it also allows him to follow the recommendation of a longtime, now-deceased friend, [Albert Hofmann](!Wikipedia), who, according to Fadiman, called micro-dosing "the most under-researched area of psychedelics."

Fadiman was part of the team which ran the [Psychedelics in problem-solving experiment](!Wikipedia), administering 50Î¼g doses of LSD - close to microdosing levels - to people working on unsolved technical problems, while they tried thinking about the problems again; they apparently often solved them. There are many fans of LSD microdosing in the relevant [Bluelight.ru](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/266623-The-Low-Dose-LSD-Appreciation-Thread) & [Longecity](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/51969-low-dose-lsd-as-a-nootropic/) & Reddit [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1n93n4/the_lsd_microdosing_experiment/)/[2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1n99k3/the_lsd_microdosing_experiment_xpost_rpsychonaut/)/[3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1ok9iy/another_lsd_microdosing_experiment/) discussions (though others [wonder about tolerance](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=116671) after repeated microdoses). Further, LSD used to be popular in Silicon Valley and used by many computing pioneers (see _[What the Dormouse Said](!Wikipedia)_, Markoff 2005).

None of this, however is particularly strong evidence. To address them in order: the problem-solving experiment was relatively small (drawing estimates from the [methodological, statistical, & meta-analytic literature](DNB FAQ#flaws-in-mainstream-science-and-psychology), we'd expect something like <17% chance the experiment would replicate) and the active placebo introduces concerns of its own (perhaps mescaline impedes problem solving rather than LSD helping); the linked anecdotes all are neither random nor blind (we know placebo effects can be extremely powerful - see the [Shulgin orange juice story](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html?pagewanted=print&position=&_r=0 "Dr. Ecstasy") - and that water can be mistaken for LSD ([Abramson et al 1955](/docs/1955-abramson.pdf "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD-25): Xv. the Effects Produced By Substitution of a Tap Water Placebo"), [Linton & Langs 1962](/docs/1962-linton.pdf "Placebo Reactions in a Study of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD-25)"))) of unquantified benefits (nor are psychedelic users aren't famous for their reliable anecdotes or critical thinking) with haphazard selection introducing arbitrarily large systematic biases; and finally correlation is not causation, and it's curious that while supposedly something like 5-10% of the American population has at some time taken a psychedelic and we know many tech figures have used it, very few specific breakthroughs like PCR can be credited to LSD use - of course many would not admit to LSD use helping, but there should still be more than the documented handful of examples.

# Experiment
## Design

LSD is an acute water-soluble drug. This makes dosing easy: take a known dose of, say, 100Î¼g, dissolve it in some water (refrigerated), and then consume 1/10th for a dose of 10Î¼g. Some online anecdotes microdose daily, while others microdose every 2 or 3 days. I added 25ml of distilled water into an airtight mason jar (LSD is neutralized by [even small amounts of chlorine](!Wikipedia "LSD#Reactivity and degradation"); later I learned chlorine is not added to my well, so this precaution was probably unnecessary), dropped the blotter in, refrigerated overnight, and removed the blotter the next afternoon.

Self-blinding a liquid is as straightforward as self-blinding pills: 2 opaque containers (one marked; both kept in refrigerator) into which a milliliter dropper puts a dose of LSD water and a dose of regular water.

This suggests the following design: a randomized dose on day 1, followed by days 2 and 3 off, then on day 4, drinking the second container; on day 7, examine the containers recording whether active/placebo and finally, starting over as day 1 of a new pair of 3-day blocks.  The power analysis (see next section) indicates >19 active days are desirable, so 190+Î¼g are needed; this can be diluted into 19ml of water and 1ml extracted each day. I ran this design by Dr. Fadiman, who did not object.

(One additional step: temporarily suspending the [lithium experiment](Nootropics#lithium-experiment). There are many mostly-negative opinions online about the interactions of LSD & lithium, although most commenters seem to be talking about *therapeutic* doses of lithium - which are 10-15x larger than the 10mg of lithium orotate which I may have been taking if it wasn't a placebo week. (It later turned out that it was indeed a placebo week so my precaution was unnecessary.) But there is no point in risking the described negative effects or the weakening of the trip, so 2 weeks before, the experiment was paused.)

The listed benefits are to mood, productivity, and creativity. We might also want to check other metrics to see if any LSD benefit came at a cost. So I will use my usual metrics plus a new creativity one:

- [Zeo]() sleep data (primarily: latency, total sleep, number of awakenings, morning feel)

    I expect little or no effect on these 4 metrics, or the more obscure ones like sleep composition (light/REM/deep percentages). Two-tailed tests.
- [Spaced repetition]() performance

    Average grade of cards reviewed on a given day; I expect no effect or a benefit (the simulated annealing analogy sounds like it might also work for memory). One-tailed.
- mood/productivity self-rating: 1-5

    3 is a normal day, 2 below-average, 4 a very good day, 5 fantastic etc. The *major* prediction of the microdose theory is that mood/productivity/creativity will increase, so the final analysis should exploit our prior and use a one-tailed test that the ratings will increase (since higher=better).
- creativity rating: 1-3

    Similar. This is not a metric I currently track, but would be a new one. One-tailed.
- active/placebo prediction

    A prediction recorded at the end of each block on PredictionBook.com; this is not a dependent variable, but a check for whether there is a reliably noticeable subjective effect.
- Before/after [Openness to experience](!Wikipedia) questionnaires

    Openness is one of the Big Five personality traits, roughly linked with creativity, interest in novelty and variety; while [Conscientiousness](!Wikipedia) (think self-discipline & hard-work) tends to increase with age, Openness seems to decrease. Personality traits, like IQ, are notoriously hard to change & predictive of many things about a person. [MacLean et al 2011](http://ud13_26.ud13.udmedia.de/hexenopas-pilz-tagebuch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/J-Psychopharmacol-September-28-2011.pdf "Mystical Experiences Occasioned by the Hallucinogen Psilocybin Lead to Increases in the Personality Domain of Openness"), a rare RCT of [psilocybin](!Wikipedia), found that Openness was still increased a few percentage points >1 year after dosing. (While not that large in magnitude, MacLean et al 2011 compares it with the reduction in Openness over 4 decades and increase from successful antidepressants or substance abuse treatment.) The effect seemed to be driven by those reporting a *mystical* experience; despite identical starting Openness, those reporting a non-mystical experience seemed to see theirs fall. The study has [many weaknesses](http://hardsci.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/does-psilocybin-cause-changes-in-personality-maybe-but-not-so-fast/ "Does psilocybin cause changes in personality? Maybe, but not so fast"), but is still the best such study I know.

    Since to maximize effectiveness, any full trip should be taken before micro-dosing, this suggest 3 samples: before-trip, after-trip, after-micro-dosing.

    My first long Big Five survey result (using [Personality Project](http://test.personality-project.org/)) in early 2012 put my Openness at the [87^th percentile](/docs/2012-gwern-personalityproject.html "Personality-project long Big Five report: first"); the [second](/docs/2012-gwern-personalityproject-2.html "Personality-project long Big Five report: second"), 2 days after the trip, was identical (87th percentile). Since I had no mystic experience, this is consistent with MacLean et al 2011's analysis. A [third followup in March 2013](/docs/2013-gwern-personalityproject.html "Personality-project long Big Five report: third"), after the microdosing experiment, put me at the 93rd percentile (needless to say, the confidence intervals for all 3 overlap due to the percentile ranking being based on relatively few questions: ~6 for each personality factor).

## Power calculation

The descriptions are that the effects are strong & noticeable, so a large [effect size](!Wikipedia) suggests a small experiment; but with 6 metrics, we will want to correct for [multiple comparisons](!Wikipedia) (which need will lower the required _p_-value in our one-tailed tests). We'll assume a large effect size, _p_=0.01, and paired/within-subject experimental design:

~~~{.R}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(d=0.8,type="paired",power=0.80,alternative="greater",sig.level=0.01)

     Paired t test power calculation

              n = 18.47818
~~~

19 pairs means 19 active and 19 placebo doses, 38 days total. This does not seem unduly onerous, but note that we're assuming LSD has a strong effect since if we cut the effect size in half to _d_=0.4 (a medium-small effect) we need 66 pairs or 132 days! (If the effects were oversold so _d_=0.4 was the correct estimate, and we went with 19 pairs, we would not have an 80% chance of detecting the effect but rather a 24% chance. Oh well. "We do what we can, because, we must - for the people who are still alive.")

How we treat individual days will matter: do we average the data for each block of 3 days into a single data point, or do we treat each dose as resulting in 3 data points - the effect on the first day, the lessened effect on the second day, and the weakest effect on the third day? (And then the next dose.) The latter seems to be a better strategy, and so with 250Î¼g we get 25 doses of 10Î¼g, each dose is 3 days so as much as 75 days for active and a similar amount for placebo. (75 pairs gives us a similar power calculation all the way down to _d_=0.4.)

In retrospect (after observing the trends which didn't reach significance), since I specified 7 metrics, it probably would have been better to be conservative and specify a significance-level of `sig.level=(0.05/7)` or 0.0071 rather than `sig.level=0.05/5` or 0.0100.

## VoI

> For background on "value of information" calculations, see the [Adderall calculation](#value-of-information-voi).

With background, design, and power calculation out of the way, we can calculate costs & values.

1. Cost of regular LSD microdosing

    A check of listings on the [Silk Road]() indicates that 300Î¼g can be bought for 5-6btc or \$45; 300Î¼g translates to 30 doses, or 90 days if I follow the 3-day dose pattern some recommend; the yearly cost of LSD is then $\frac{45}{\frac{90}{365}} = 183$. Discounted at 5% annually, the net-present-value/lifetime-cost of switching to LSD would be $\frac{183}{ln 1.05} = 3,751$. We can reuse this figure as the potential benefit of LSD microdoses, since if the effect is positive and large enough to notice, then it seems worth roughly 50 cents a day!

    There are 3 major categories of additional costs: the medical risk one runs during the experiment, the legal risk, and the reputational risk.

    1. Earlier, I looked into research bearing on the relation of [LSD and Schizophrenia](!Wikipedia), and concluded that the evidence was most consistent with LSD having small health risks (that is, the damaged or ill sought out all sorts of drugs including LSD, but LSD did not cause the damage or at best caused the illness to surface earlier) with some correlations of [psychiatric benefit from use](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0063972 "'Psychedelics and Mental Health: A Population Study', Krebs & Johansen 2013"); this was over the general LSD population including brain-frying large doses, so the risk for microdoses ought to be much smaller. Much later it occurred to me that the rarity of using LSD along with sheer small size of LSD actually reduces the risk of consumption compared to many other products, simply because dangerous doses of many contaminants or poisons won't fit: blotters reportedly max out at ~500Î¼g. Compare that with, say, piracetam where people take <3g of powder daily; if the piracetam was just 0.3% contaminants, that's as much as 1mg of the stuff - but a blotter can't even hold 1mg of *any* substance, much less an active dose of some substance plus accidental contamination. Overall, I feel comfortable rounding it to zero. To estimate the possible impact on schizophrenia, I looked into estimates of hallucinogen consumption and found that estimates ranged from 7-12% of the entire American population (~22-38 million people) had consumed at some point, which over something like a 60-year lifespan (teenager to very old adult) implies something like 600,000 hallucinogen 'virgins' per year (a figure echoed in one of Fadiman's articles).
    2. Searching, I found a [1994 federal Sentencing Commission document](http://www.ussc.gov/Data_and_Statistics/Federal_Sentencing_Statistics/State_District_Circuit/1995/cae95.pdf) listing 83 sentences involving LSD that year (while searching I also found some information indicating that 400Î¼g is considered 1 dose, so the microdose experiment would involve <1 dose!); news articles suggest many (most?) of those would be for sellers and manufacturers, so a further analysis would reduce the risk accordingly. In any case, even if we multiply by 50 for each state, $\frac{600000}{50\times83} = 145$ suggesting a rough estimate of 1 in 145 chance of being convicted. Leniency could be expected for a first-time non-violent non-trafficking offender, so we could set the cost of this outcome at perhaps just $100,000, or an expected loss/cost of $700.
    3. Some reputational effects are clearly negative: a use of LSD would be a big issue in some roles like running for elected office or being CEO of a large company (unless one is a secular saint like Steve Jobs), especially since I would obviously be unable to make an excuse like "youthful experimentation" or "a momentary lapse of judgment", this writeup demonstrating that my use was thoroughly premeditated; however, this does not bother me inasmuch as I am unfitted by both temperament and talent for such positions. (Something similar could be said about security clearances.) In many more conservative regions, it would be a substantial negative, but I am already a poor fit for such regions and I don't know whether an LSD use would be very negative at the margin, or whether *any* of my experiments or essays have already done the damage.

        On the positive side, however: in some groups or regions like California (which may yet lie in my future), a use of LSD may be a net positive as it indicates valued qualities like open-mindedness. The lifetime consumption rate implies that something like 12% of the population would not judge me harshly for any use. That I have been careful and responsible in my experimentation, and had multiple purposes in addition to mere recreation, will lessen the offense for many people (but possibly would increase my guilt in the eyes of others). There are many famous LSD users like Bill Gates, Richard Feynman, Oliver Sacks, [Francis Crick](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4312369), Kary Mullis etc, but they seem to have discussed their drug use only after achieving mainstream success; worse, the famous users all seem to have been associated with the 1960s or with computers, suggesting tolerance for them may be a passing phase and younger people not so lenient (but on the other hand, marijuana legalization efforts are actually succeeding before and during 2012, suggesting that America may be even more tolerant in the future).

        All considered: I am not sure what the reputational cost would be, nor do I have good ways to estimate it, and given the invisibility of many reputational costs - how do you know when someone *didn't* offer something to you or how people are bad-mouthing you? - I may never know the actual cost to me (compared to, say, being arrested for LSD possession).
2. How much will the experiment cost to run?

    The procedure each morning uses up no more than 5 minutes so $\frac{38\times 5}{60} \times 8 = 25$ dollars of time. The sleep, spaced repetition, and mood/productivity data I already collect, and the creativity self-rating is another few seconds, and so not worth calculating. I'm not sure if I have an appropriate dropper/syringe available; that and other supplies might tack on another $10. So $45+25+10=80$ dollars.
3. Priors:

    The accuracy of the information ranges 20-80% depending on the effect size; since it's inline with my previous knowledge of LSD and based on more than a handful of anecdotes, I would be somewhat optimistic about there being an effect, so a 50% chance the effect exists.
4. Value of Information

    Power times prior times benefit minus cost of experimentation: $0.2-0.8 \times 0.5 \times 3751 - 80 - 700 =$ -405 to +720. If we cut out the legal risk, the range is +295-1420 and the experiment well worth doing; our estimate of the legal risk and the effect size determine whether we find it worth doing.

## Fadiman comments

After I completed the experiment and prepared the data, but before doing any analysis (besides the prediction accuracy to check the blinding), I emailed Fadiman the following questions, and he replied:

>> 1. You've seen my planning and methodology write up, and I've attached the current version of my full writeup with everything I've added or changed since (mostly more background, a log of dates, that sort of thing) if you want to reread it. Do you have any objections to how I did it?
>
> Most important: I am deeply impressed and pleased with your totally original and cleverly designed experiment. That you are able to add a double-blind to a one person self-study is a delight in itself. I am incredibly happy to see how many different ways you went at this. In terms of the general write up, I happened to be an ardent fan of a mix of data, personal reflection and observation. Scientific writing all too often does everything it can to make the subject under scrutiny as dull as possible in the writing, as uninteresting as possible, and heaven forbid, to include any genuinely real and personal commentary. So I love the way you did it exactly. The changes all seem to me expansions and improvements.
>
>> 2. Have you or anyone else as far as you know, done a long blind/randomized/both self-experiment on LSD microdosing?
>
> Short answer. No. Long answer: no one. Longest answer - the number of people are doing self-experiments with LSD and other psychedelics and even MDMA is expanding. No one is even approaching what you're doing.
>
>> 3. If the results turn out to be non-statistically-significant or have very small effect sizes, why do you think they might have turned out that way? Which reasons would you have most confidence in as an explanation of null results?
>
> I do have some guesses as to why non-significance might occur, and that is putting aside just the obvious statistical possibility of using small sample sizes. I will be actually very content to see null results since it will force me and others to dig more deeply for possible reasons. So far, you are the first who might produce such results and certainly since you're the first double-blind, it adds to the value of what you're doing. As you probably know there's a big controversy in the regular medical literature about how many serious drug studies of multibillion-dollar drugs and up with no [statistically-]significant differences a few years out from their sales launch and almost always from university-based studies, not being paid by the pharmaceutical company.
>
> In psychedelic studies, 100% success rates are much harder to describe to non-psychedelic audiences used to more conventional and much lower success rates about almost everything.
>
> One possible reason, that only you can answer, and you may have done so in the body of the text, but if so I missed it. I'm not sure that you took a couple of non-blind micro-doses beforehand to be sure that you could notice a difference with every placebo and positive intention going with you to notice the difference to establish a personal baseline of awareness of the substance. If that was not done, then it's not at all clear that the very simple measurements used on a daily basis were sensitive enough to pick up days on and days off. The more usual studies from other people that I've seen, (none of them even attempting a double-blind or any blind at all,) are looking for a set of internal changes that they have previously experienced. These may be as subtle as eating a healthier lunch, doing a few more reps at a gym, being able to focus on the task an hour longer and so forth. I have a couple of write-ups in my book and when you get to them, you can see that we're dealing with fairly intricate internal measures which you also cover in detail now and then in your personal commentaries.
>
> That's my favorite possible reason. Another is that, while some people are very aware on the day of the micro-dose, others are clear that it is a two-day experience, and a few even longer. If even a tiny residue of the micro-dose is still active at the time of the next dose, it might make it harder to distinguish and on from an off day.
>
> However, I'm also aware that also for some people, the dose is too low.
>
> The report in my book that I find most charming, a woman who's been micro-dosing for about 8 years - except during her pregnancy - uses 20 Âµg, which for me would be perceptual. So an alternative reason, even though the least interesting one, is that your dose was too low. A few people had felt it was better to drop down to 7 or 8Âµg to not get too high. Human variability.
>
> I'm sure I can come up with more complicated reasons, but you asked what my thoughts were before we completed the analysis and there you are.
>
>> 4. Do you expect the results to turn out positive? (By positive here, I mean statistically-significant after multiple correction and _d_>0.1.) How much so?
>
> I did expect the results to turn out positive because there are real effects that have been reported, not only in my little studies, but for the past few thousand years in indigenous societies who of course have experimented with micro-doses and every other conceivable form of use.
>
> As to how [statistically-]significant the statistical breakout would be - I've not really thought much about it. This was your study and your level of statistical sophistication clearly exceeds my own. I tend to be somewhat suspicious of any study where the statistics are fairly exotic, since I know from watching my graduate students PhD dissertations, that when really simple and almost intuitively obvious statistics don't show results, they start to shop around until they find something that gives them a positive result even if it's a statistic that nobody else seems to know about. I watch statistical consultants assure students that they will find something that will justify hiring them. Is this pure science as God and Descartes would have it? Not in my book but hey, the real world is never as clean as the data derived from it.
>
>> 5. Are you willing to be quoted on any of the above?
>
> Of course, you are free to quote me in anything you write, and I'm free to complain that I was quoted out of context or anything else I choose to say to cover my tail. But in this case, you did the work - you asked me to review the work - and therefore my review becomes part of the total package.

I did this for much the same reason as I wrote down the exact metrics and analysis in advance: to specify what results are expected, how one will interpret them, and to eliminate the temptation to fudge or modify or spin or self-deceive about any of it.

## Analysis
### Preparation

Preparing the data:

Needed to extract Mnemosyne scores for the past [175 days](http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=9&d1=16&y1=2012&m2=3&d2=9&y2=2013&ti=on); for a multi-level model analysis, I'll want even more days which were neither active nor control so I extract even more days than that (back 451 days). Using a Mnemosyne script in the development repository, I set the time interval:

~~~{.Python}
+++ mnemosyne/mnemosyne/example_scripts/export_stats.py 2013-03-10 21:54:04 +0000
@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@
 data_dir = None
 mnemosyne = Mnemosyne(data_dir)

-for n in range(-10, 0):
+for n in range(-275, -1):
     start_of_day = mnemosyne.database().start_of_day_n_days_ago(abs(n))
~~~

Then run it, extracting the average grade & transforming the days I didn't review for R:

~~~{.Bash}
./bin/python ./mnemosyne/example_scripts/export_stats.py \
     | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed -e 's/None/NA/' > ~/mnemosyne.csv
~~~

In R I read in a hand-trimmed Zeo export (`lsd.csv`), parse dates, add in the Mnemosyne daily grades, the mood/productivity & creativity daily self-ratings, and write it all back out:

~~~{.R}
lsd <- read.csv("lsd.csv")
lsd$Date <- as.Date(lsd$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
# Zeo's CSV export silently omits missing days; look for them to hand-edit empty rows in
# which(!((as.Date("2012-06-09"):as.Date("2012-09-15")) %in% lsd$Date))
mnemo <- read.table("mnemosyne.csv")
lsd$Mnemosyne <- NA
lsd$Mnemosyne <- mnemo$V1
mp <- read.csv("mp.csv")
lsd$MP <- NA
lsd$MP <- mp$MP
creativity <- read.table("creativity.csv")
lsd$Creativity <- NA
lsd$Creativity <- creativity$V1
write.csv(lsd, file="lsd.csv", row.names=FALSE)
~~~

### Blinding

How successful was the blinding: could I guess whether I had gotten a LSD or a placebo? A comparison of the log score shows my self-assessments were only slightly better than random (eg. remove the last prediction, and the random guesser performs equally or better):

~~~{.Haskell}
let predictions = [(True,  0.45),(False, 0.55),(True,  0.60),(False, 0.40),(True,  0.40),(True,  0.60),
                   (False, 0.40),(True,  0.40),(False, 0.50),(True,  0.40),(False, 0.50),(False, 0.40),
                   (False, 0.60),(True,  0.40),(True,  0.65),(True,  0.50),(False, 0.40),(False, 0.60),
                   (True,  0.60),(True,  0.75)]
logScore ps = sum $ map (\(result,p) -> if result then log p else log (1-p)) ps

logScore predictions
~> -13.4685

log 0.50 * fromIntegral (length predictions)
~> -13.8629
~~~

### Testing the metrics

Testing for a statistically-significant (_p_<0.05) difference on the listed metrics[^LSD-NHST]:

1. Sleep:

    - latency: none
    - total sleep: none
    - number of awakenings: none
    - morning feel: increased

        There is an increase in "Morning Feel" from 2.6 to 2.9, _p_=0.023; correcting for performing 7 different tests, this result is not statistically-significant (it does not survive a [Bonferroni correction](!Wikipedia) (since $0.0231 > \frac{0.05}{7}$) nor the [_q_-value approach](Zeo#fn7) to family-wise correction[^LSD-q-value]).
2. Flashcard scores: none
3. Mood/productivity: none (_d_=-0.18)
4. Creativity: none (_d_=-0.19)
5. active/placebo prediction: see previous section
6. Before/after Openness: see previous section

Overall, there seems to have been no meaningful effects.

### Microdose effect length

I classified by hand each day in the relevant period by how many days distant it was from the preceding LSD microdose (that is, the first day of an LSD block is 0, the second day is 1, the third day is 2, and so on up to 7, and past that I just round down to 7). The idea is that this lets us ask for a linear fit relating MP on days which are _n_ distant from a LSD microdose and see if there's any apparent trend - it may be that we failed to see a statistically-significant relationship because we lumped in all days together.

Do we get a better fit if we omit days "too far" from the microdose, reasoning that the effects would've stopped?

Obviously the _p_-values are meaningless in this application; more importantly, the reversal of coefficient sign and changing coefficient size & significance don't suggest anything in particular to me about dose period.

### Advanced analysis: multi-level models

None of the data variables except 'creativity' were collected just for this LSD microdosing experiment: they all have an extensive baseline before or after the experiment. These LSD-free days can't help us estimate how LSD days looked (how could they?), but using [multi-level models](!Wikipedia), they can help us nail down what LSD-free days in general look like and reduce uncertainty in estimating their true mean, which makes the comparison to LSD days a little more accurate.

As before, the highest _t_-value even with partial pooling to the extensive baseline data, is for 'Morning Feel'. The MLM spits out a 95% CI for its effect being increasing the score by 0.07-0.61 (0.34 would be an increase of _d_=0.42, which is nice). In contrast, the original _t_-test for 'Morning Feel' gave a CI of 0.05-0.63; so the pooling gained us a slightly narrower CI.

More importantly, what about mood/productivity (`MP`)? An ordinary linear model on just the data gives a CI of -0.3765-0.123. The MLM gives instead -0.3773-0.121. So unfortunately, the extra work doesn't noticeably change the conclusion.

# Trip report

In September 2012, I prepared a [table of LSD vendors & products](Silk Road#vendor-table). When a particular vendor's listings went up, I added them in and they were no-brainer to order. I ordered a 2-tab Mayan on the 5th and they arrived on the 19th barely within my predicted time period of [2 weeks](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8140 "My LSD order will arrive within 2 weeks: 70%") (but they [did arrive](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8141 "My LSD order will arrive: 90%")). I rather liked their stealth packaging, that would not have occurred to me. My main complaint was that I was expecting it to arrive by the 15th or 16th, and when I PMed the vendor for the tracking number (I had paid for that), he never replied. More than a little annoying at the time, but the package did arrive, so I decided to leave a 5-star review after my trip.

I spent the next day doing the first tab. I should mention I have never done any psychedelics before, so I cannot possibly guess whether they were 250Î¼g as advertised. It was a long and exhausting day, so I will just sketch it. I had a light breakfast, went through my checklist of preparations: empty camera, back up computer, clean up, shower & dress nicely, hide modafinil & other tab of LSD, and then review the trip plan - meditation, music, and walk.

At 1:25PM I finished preparations, took the tab sublingually, and went outside with my blanket to meditate. It was an extremely nice day out, with a very bright sun but a cool steady breeze off the water. I was disappointed in the first hour when nothing seemed to be happening during my meditation except I found it unusually easy to concentrate. I wondered if my slight muscle tremors were related, but I find the half-lotus posture difficult so that is not unusual. By 1:54 I finished meditating. A little disappointed that after half an hour, nothing seemed to be happening, I headed inside for some music.

The music was unusually absorbing; but within 15 minutes (by 2:26), a vague tiredness like I needed a nap, a headache, and some nausea had built up. At 2:45, I made myself a PB&J sandwich, but the bad feeling doesn't go away so I decide it's a good time to go for a long walk. (I check my pupils in the mirror before going. They seem a little bigger but I wasn't sure if I was imagining it - I don't regularly check my pupils' dilation.)

The walk at 2:50 makes me feel a little better within 10 minutes. During the walk, I notice my body seems to be feeling 'mechanical' and my movements weaker, with my skin feeling like a flesh glove (if that metaphor makes sense), although at the same time, the bright sunlight and cool wind feel exceptionally vivid to my senses; I was reminded of when I went skydiving and on the way down, the world seemed to 'pop'. Apparently the acidhead term for this is 'body load'. My normal chatter of thoughts and introspection slowed down considerably, perhaps because the walk was making me feel much better and I was trying to enjoy the raw sensations. I was relieved that the LSD was not a bust as I had begun to fear, since that would force a hard choice (continue the microdosing experiment with LSD of unknown quality or quantity, or abandon it by using the second tab to see if the first tab was a fluke?). One persistent problem was my jaw or neck muscles seemed to be rigid or clenching and I had to keep relaxing them or they would create a sort of want-to-vomit feeling, which was pretty strange when I focused on it. But I still wasn't impressed by the experience.

In no real hurry at all, by 3:25 I got to the end of the road where there's a beautiful view of the inlet and the sky. As I usually do on this walk, I happened to spend a little time cloud-watching, and I realized that the clouds were strobing like stop-animation as I focused on individual patches; in particular, I realized that I could force a visual flip (like the young/old woman optical illusion or the rabbit-duck illusion) from seeing a sky of blue with thin clouds to a roiling stormscape where the blue was the black, and the white clouds were just the illuminated underside. Quite interesting, and an unexpected [figure-ground](!Wikipedia "Figure-ground (perception)") inversion. I also could temporarily force [pareidolia](!Wikipedia) by visualizing and willing the clouds to form claw or grasping hands or vaguely human-like shapes.

This absorbed my attention for half an hour or so until a guy on the pier asked if I was OK (I hope just because I'd been laying looking like I was taking a nap and not because I was visibly tripping). I waved him off successfully but I decided it was a good time to head back. The walk back was entirely uneventful, although I stopped at the grove of trees by my place to watch the clouds some more from a longer perspective.

Back home, I spent the next 2-3 hours listening to music by _[Explosions in the Sky](!Wikipedia)_ tracks, which while planning I had thought would sound better on LSD. I was right - the experience was amazing. Lying in bed with my eyes blindfolded and just listening carefully, I have never followed the music so well, or been so moved emotionally or physically by it. My misanthropic soul was moved twice to tears.

Entirely wrung out by the experience, I went out to watch the sunset over the creek with the cat and ruminate over the day. This actually turned out to be almost as meaningful, since I realized as the cat gamboled over our little hill of a few tons of rocks that a cat or fox playing on a pile of rocks as the sun set was a good metaphor for my own life. (I am a thorough-going atheist, and as I predicted, I had no real [mystical experience](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8159 "LSD: I will experience a partial or fully mystical experience, 35%") and I [remained an atheist](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8144 "I will cease to identify as an atheist after my LSD trip: 10%").) This realization made me feel better.

When I went in, I was sitting in the bathroom thinking how my expectations were guiding the visual effects, and I thought to myself, "Speaking of pareidolia, I bet even this orange-bleach-stained towel could become something interesting if I focus hard enough" and after a few minutes I realized that I could see the stains as the Tibetan underworld god [Yama](!Wikipedia) and see the flames flicker behind the towel. (Yama is not important to me and I do not think about him, so I don't know how he came to mind. For a report in middle or high school long ago, I had drawn by hand a large albeit stripped down copy of [a Yama mandala](http://www.thangka-mandala.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mara-Wheel-of-Life.jpg). His design was really cool and I guess it stuck!)

After that I watched _[Wings of Honneamise](!Wikipedia)_ (I prefer it to _2001: A Space Odyssey_, and needed to rewatch it for my Gainax research), which was as excellent as I remembered. I noticed a number of things this time around that I hadn't the first time, like the protagonist employing his sword training in dealing with an assassin - echoing the general theme of him drawing on the training & space program he had previously considered useless. I also think I understand his attempted rape better: throughout the movie appear dichotomies between peace & war, good and bad - the space program is peaceful but used to spark war, technology is what lifts up man but also used to hurt and kill, etc. The protagonist befriends the woman and orphan, but the motivation to love can also be the motivation to desire.

By 9:39, I finished it and then did some dual n-back to see how bad my performance was 9-10 hours after dosing (average: 50/20/41/42/47). Some generic reading and chatting online rounded off my day. By this point, I felt pretty much fine except for some odd fine motor control issues: typing had become surprisingly challenging as I had to *think* about it. But I was kind of tired from all the new experience, so I went to bed - whereupon I suffered massive insomnia. TODO: include Zeo graph? This apparently isn't an unknown effect, although the reports I read did not emphasize it, and I should have planned on going to bed more like 3AM. Oh well.

Overall, a good experience as [I expected](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8160 "LSD: My trip will be generally positive (and not a 'bad trip'), 75%") especially since I [experienced no law enforcement trouble](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8142 " I will be visited or questioned or arrested by police over my LSD order."). But I'm not sure I'll ever need to do a LSD trip again (the second tab is for the microdose experiment), and I don't understand how people can do it on even a monthly basis, for a number of reasons: LSD isn't cheap, for starter; I felt it was too powerful an experience to undergo for frivolous reasons (I definitely see why it was investigated in connection with brainwashing); and in particular, one shouldn't weaken it but save it for when one has questions or needs.

In retrospect, 250Î¼g may have been too high and responsible for the 'body load' and the insomnia. I've felt somewhat similar feelings with too-high doses of stimulants and nootropics. (I don't regard it as a big deal, though: the insomnia was much more unpleasant, and I think could have been dealt with by staying up later.) Otherwise, the dose was OK. As I said, I had planned things and hidden anything incriminating and had already done the risk analysis, so I wasn't worried about police. It was a beautiful day out, few people were around, and I knew I was safe (and also that thinking I was safe helped *make* me be safe - '[set and setting](!Wikipedia)', right?). Plus, I seem to be an unusually calm and emotionally controlled person, so I had even less reason to fear turning out like the cliched 'friend panicking in the woods after a dose'. It seemed to work out.
