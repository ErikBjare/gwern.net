In June 2012, early in the experiment, my neighbors threw out a treadmill that turned out to be easily repaired and so I set up an improvised [treadmill desk](!Wikipedia) with my laptop and a spare board. I had read about them before, had since seen a number of negative reports about being sedentary or sitting, and my physical fitness had declined markedly since leaving university (with ready access to the gym, fencing club, and Taekwondo class), so it seemed like the obvious thing to do. The lowest setting on the treadmill (no incline, 1MPH) was initially fairly exhausting but I improved. I started with one mile a day and moved up in a few days to 3-4 miles a day (putting me at the high end of my daily steps as recorded by my pedometer, which annoyingly I lost just 2 days before finding the treadmill); for some reason, this seemed to affect my weight, which went from 218 pounds to 214 a week later and 213 the next day. I finetuned the treadmill desk for typing on my laptop by increasing the height of the board with book supports. My productivity suffered drastically the first days, and I was concerned it would rendered typing difficult, but my scores in my typing practice program ([Amphetype](https://code.google.com/p/amphetype/)) did not seem to change very much when I tested them on all subsequent days that I used the treadmill. I suspect that my average WPM went down somewhat, though my statistical analysis indicated it fell only slightly if at all[^Amphetype]. The gear on the treadmill itself began to loosen, which led to the rubber band slipping off the motor or the gear, and I had to stop for a few days while I figured out solutions. (The epoxy was a mistake as it required a 'hardener' I didn't have; a thin nail couldn't be hammered between the gear and treadmill bar as a shim; and I had to let the Gorilla Glue harden for a day before it performed admirably during the test run.) A few days later, the mat began slipping and just stopping, and I discovered that the gear was rotating freely on the treadmill bar - the friction and glue had apparently lost! I lost several days hoping it would dry. It did and seemed to work again, but to help deal with it, I lubricated the underside of the mat with WD-40. It seemed to work

My expectations are that the treadmill will increase how much I sleep, decrease sleep latency, and possibly have a small negative effect on productivity (which may be offset by an improvement in mood and less need to get a daily walk). If it were intense aerobic fitness, I might expect an increase in cognitive abilities or various sorts, but it's not, so I don't expect any effect on Mnemosyne scores.

# Typing

Fortunately, I had used Amphetype for typing practice for 3 years prior to finding the treadmill, so I could compare my daily treadmill typing sessions to a very long dataseries.

![WPM (top) and accuracy scores (bottom) plotted over time on a time-scaled X-axis with undampened values. The tight group at the far right is the week or two of typing practice while using a treadmill.](/images/zeo/2012-amphetype.png)

The graph looks like WPM (but not Accuracy) may have been damaged, but it's not clear at all: we should do statistics. Amphetype stores the graphed data in a [SQLite](!Wikipedia) database, which after a little tinkering I figured out how to extract the WPM & Accuracy scores:

~~~{.Bash}
sqlite3 -batch gwern.db 'SELECT w real, wpm real, accuracy real FROM result;' > ~/stats.txt
~~~

Which gives a file like

~~~
1233502576.01172|70.2471151325281|0.981412639405205
1233502634.48339|80.9762013034008|0.989159891598916
1233502677.26434|74.0623733171948|0.988326848249027
...
~~~

The pipes are delimiters, which I replaced with commas (`tr '|' ','`). The first field is a date-stamp expressed in seconds since the [Unix epoch](!Wikipedia); they can be converted to more readable dates like so:

~~~{.Bash}
$ date --date '@1308320681.44771'
Fri Jun 17 10:24:41 EDT 2011
~~~

I went through the 2870 lines until I found the first treadmill session I did on June 16. After splitting, deleting the date-stamps, and adding a CSV header like `WPM,Accuracy`, I had had 2285 entries for [2012-gwern-amphetype-before.csv](/docs/2012-gwern-amphetype-before.csv) and 585 for [2012-gwern-amphetype-after.csv](/docs/2012-gwern-amphetype-after.csv). Then it is easy to load the CSVs into R and test:

~~~{.R}
before <- read.csv("http://www.gwern.net/docs/2012-gwern-amphetype-before.csv")
after <- read.csv("http://www.gwern.net/docs/2012-gwern-amphetype-after.csv")
t.test(before$WPM, after$WPM); t.test(before$Accuracy, after$Accuracy)

sample estimates:

0.9875169 0.9891269
~~~

What? Using a treadmill made my average WPM go *up* 5 WPM? And my average accuracy increased 0.002%? And both are highly statistically-significant (not a surprise, given how many entries there were)? What's going on - this is the exact opposite of expected! The key is the low mean of the `before` data: I type much faster than 82 WPM now, more like 90 or 100 WPM. What happened was that I spent 3 years practicing. Given that I was improving, it is wrong to compare the recent treadmill typing data against a low long-run average without any consideration of this trend of increasing WPM. What would be better would be to lop off the first half of the `before` data to get a fairer comparison with `after`, since I began to plateau around then. Redoing the tests:

~~~{.R}
t.test(before$WPM[1144:2285], after$WPM); t.test(before$Accuracy[1144:2285], after$Accuracy)
    Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  before$WPM[1144:2285] and after$WPM
t = -5.3227, df = 1132.508, p-value = 1.232e-07
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95% confidence interval:
 -3.429192 -1.581982
sample estimates:

 85.05376  87.55935

    Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  before$Accuracy[1144:2285] and after$Accuracy
t = -1.3091, df = 1156.249, p-value = 0.1908

95% confidence interval:
 -0.001290  0.000257
sample estimates:

0.9886105 0.9891269
~~~

This is more reasonable: only a 2 WPM gain from the treadmill. 2 WPM could be explicable as just a placebo effect: me wanting to justify the time I've sunk into the treadmill and typing practice every day. It's still a little surprising, but the result initially seems solider. (If we drop every score before 2000 instead of 1144, the difference continues to shrink but still favors the treadmill. We have to go to scores 2100-2285 before the treadmill starts to lose, but with 2200-2285 the treadmill wins!) Accuracy seems largely unaffected. Better yet, we can model the linear progress of my WPM over time and test for a variation that way:

~~~{.R}
before$Treadmill <- FALSE
after$Treadmill <- TRUE
typing <- rbind(before, after)
typing$Nth <- 1:nrow(typing)
summary(lm(WPM ~ Nth + Treadmill, data=typing))

Call:
lm(formula = WPM ~ Nth + Treadmill, data = typing)

Residuals:
   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max
-77.36  -5.87  -0.06   6.29  27.49

Coefficients:

Nth            0.00462    0.00028   16.49   <2e-16
TreadmillTRUE -1.41533    0.57651   -2.45    0.014

Residual standard error: 8.91 on 2867 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.131, Adjusted R-squared:  0.13
F-statistic:  216 on 2 and 2867 DF,  p-value: <2e-16
~~~

This is more as expected: so walking on the treadmill cost me -1.5WPM in typing speed, and a day of practice correlates with +0.004WPM (and so a full month of practice would be worth 0.12WPM, so it's probably time to call typing practice quits as having reached diminishing returns).

# Spaced repetition

[Starting in 2010](http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/walking-and-learning/), Seth Roberts began claiming that he found his [Anki](!Wikipedia "Anki (software)") flashcard reviews ([spaced repetition](Spaced repetition)) to be easier when he did them while using his treadmill, and offers some just-so evolutionary psychology theorizing that walking may cue knowledge absorption in a "thirst for knowledge".

An effect strikes me as plausible: flashcard review does not require fine motor skills or difficult thinking, and the walking might well wake one up if nothing else. But on the other hand, the walking might also be simply a distraction from the work of recall and damage real performance, much like how a lot of people claim playing music while studying "helps them focus" (for example, [Perham & Sykora 2012](/docs/dnb/2012-perham.pdf "Disliked Music can be Better for Performance than Liked Music") found music damaged memory recall, and enjoyed music the most).

Since Anki, like Mnemosyne, records detailed statistics about flashcard reviews, he has the data to show some objective performance measurements like whether days on the treadmill increase the average flashcard scores; he would have years of data, far more than he needs to show what he believes to be "a big effect". As far as I know, he has never made any use of the Anki data. He does [quote some data](http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/09/05/new-treadmill-catalyzes-learning-results/) from a [2012 presentation by Jeremy Howard](http://vimeo.com/40265872), who claims a 5% review error-rate while walking and 8% while not-walking, and to be "40% faster [at learning]".

Having acquired a treadmill, and being a long-time user of Mnemosyne, this seems eminently testable. While trying to adapt to the treadmill, I simply randomize whether I do my daily Mnemosyne review before or after getting on the treadmill. (Unfortunately, I can think of no way to blind treadmill use, so randomization is it.)

One concern, prompted by the [2013 Lewis meditation](Lewis meditation) results, is that there may be time-of-day effects on flashcard review; I tend to not use the treadmill in the morning (I am not a morning person), so if recall improved in the afternoon, then it might be conflated with the treadmill. So I have downloaded the 4GB public Mnemosyne dataset (every Mnemosyne user is offered the option to anonymously submit statistical data about their flashcards) to try to analyze it and estimate fixed effects of time which will control for such issues.
