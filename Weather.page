The scientific literature has found that [lighting & temperature](http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-science-of-how-room-temperature-and-lighting-affects-our-productivity) & [the seasons](!Wikipedia "Seasonal affective disorder") matter to one's mood, focus, sleep and other things. Certainly, these things having large effects makes a lot of sense - who doesn't feel gloomy on a rainy day or happier on a sunny day?

But things everyone knows often turn out to be wrong; and in my case, it seems like my morning use of [vitamin D](Nootropics#vitamin-d) and evening [melatonin](Melatonin) supplementation may be screening off the environmental effects. So one rainy and then sunny day in March 2013, I wondered if I could find an influence of rain or darkness on my own mood or productivity.

As it happens, since 16 February 2012, I have been daily writing down my impression of whether my mood & productivity (MP) that day was average, below-average, or above; this gave me 399 ratings to work with. I didn't record any weather data, but weather data ought to be available online. So I can find it, and see what aspects of the weather influence my self-rating, if any.

# Data

A convenient source of data seems to be [Weather Underground](!Wikipedia "Weather Underground (weather service)"). Going via [API](http://allthingsr.blogspot.com/2012/04/getting-historical-weather-data-in-r.html) is overkill, since we just need data from [Islip](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KISP/2013/3/19/MonthlyHistory.html?MR=1) for 16 February 2012 - 08 July 2012 ([CSV](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KISP/2012/2/16/CustomHistory.html?dayend=8&monthend=7&yearend=2012&req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA&format=1)) and from [Pax River](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KNHK/2012/7/11/CustomHistory.html?dayend=9&monthend=3&yearend=2013&req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA&MR=1) 11 July 2012 - 22 March 2013 ([CSV](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KNHK/2012/7/11/CustomHistory.html?dayend=22&monthend=3&yearend=2013&req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA&format=1)). I'm using the nearest airport, rather than the nearest volunteer weather station, to get data on cloud cover; cloud cover should be a good proxy for brightness or sunniness. The [insol](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/insol/index.html) library calculates the length of day, another potentially relevant variable.

After cleanup, the data looks reasonable and as expected, with each variable spanning the ranges one would expect of temperatures and precipitation:

`CloudCover` being 0-8 looks a bit odd, since one might've expected a decimal or percentage or some quantification of thickness but turns out to be a standard measurement, the "[okta](!Wikipedia)". We might expect some seasonal effects, but graphing a sensitive [LOESS](!Wikipedia) [moving average](!Wikipedia) and then a per-week spineplot suggests just 1 anomaly, that there were some days I rated "1" but never subsequently (this has an explanation: as I began keeping the series, my car caught on fire, was totaled; and I was then put through the wringer with the insurance & junkyard, and felt truly miserable at multiple points):

~~~{.R}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
scatter.smooth(x=weather$EDT, y=weather$MP, span=0.3, col="#CCCCCC", xlab="Days", ylab="MP rating")
weeks <- c(seq(from=1,to=length(weather$MP),by=7), length(weather$MP))
spineplot(c(1:(length(weather$MP))), as.factor(weather$MP), breaks=weeks, xlab="Weeks", ylab="MP rating ratios")
~~~

![MP from February 2012 to March 2013](/images/2013-weather-seasonal.png)

A formal check for [autocorrelation](!Wikipedia) in MP ratings (most methods assume independence) turns up little enough[^autocorrelation] that I feel free to ignore them.

[^autocorrelation]: A test using `acf` shows no autocorrelation worth mentioning:

    ~~~{.R}
    acf(weather$MP, main="Do days predict subsequent days at various distances?")
    ~~~

    ![MP series shows almost no autocorrelation at any timelag](/images/2013-weather-autocorrelation-mp.png)

    For comparison, here is `acf` for a data series where one would expect a great deal of autocorrelation - my daily weight - and one does indeed observe it:

So the data looks clean and tame; now we can begin real interpretation. The first and most obvious thing to do is to see what the overall correlation matrix with MP looks like:

~~~{.R}

~~~

All the _r_ values seem very small; only 2 are >0.1, and not by much. But some of the more plausible correlations may be statistically significant, so we'll look for that:

~~~{.R}
sapply(c("Events", "Min.Humidity", "Min.VisibilityMiles", "PrecipitationIn", "CloudCover", "Events", "DayLength"),
       function(x) cor.test(weather$MP, weather[[x]]))
...
            Events                                 Min.Humidity
p.value     0.2993                                 0.2964
estimate    -0.05209                               -0.0524

            Min.VisibilityMiles                    PrecipitationIn
p.value     0.9945                                 0.3086
estimate    -0.0003455                             -0.0511

            CloudCover                             Events
p.value     0.9437                                 0.2993
estimate    0.003549                               -0.05209

            DayLength
p.value     0.6254
estimate    0.02451
~~~

These specific variables turn out to be failures too, with large _p_-values.

One useful technique is to convert metrics into standardized units (of standard deviations), sum them all into a single composite variable, and then test that; this can reveal influences not obvious if one looked at the metrics individually. (For example, in my [potassium sleep experiments](Zeo#potassium), where I was interested in an overall measure of reduced sleep quality rather than single metrics like sleep latency.) Perhaps this would work here?

~~~{.R}
# construct a z-score for all of them to see if it does any better
cor.test(weather$MP, (weather$Events + scale(weather$Min.Humidity) + scale(weather$Min.VisibilityMiles)
                      + scale(weather$PrecipitationIn) + scale(weather$CloudCover) + scale(weather$DayLength)))
...
t = -0.8365, df = 397, p-value = 0.4034
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.13955  0.05646
sample estimates:
     cor
-0.04195
~~~

## Modeling
### Continuous MP
#### Linear model

The correlations show individually little value, so we'll move on to building modeling and assessing their fit. Can we accurately predict MP if we use all the parameters? We'll start with a linear model/regression, where we treat the categorical MP variable as a continuous variable for simplicity:

~~~{.R}
model1 <- lm(MP ~ ., data=weather[-1]); summary(model1)
...

The variance explained is extremely minimal, even with 23 different variables in the linear model, and suggests overfitting (as one would expect). By Occam's razor, most of the variables should be scrapped for not carrying their weight; the `step` function uses a [complexity penalty](!Wikipedia "Akaike information criterion") to choose which variable to eliminate while still fitting the data reasonably well. It choose to keep only 2 variables:

~~~{.R}
smodel1 <- step(model1); summary(smodel1)
...
lm(formula = MP ~ 1, data = weather[-1])

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max
-1.9875 -0.9875  0.0125  1.0125  1.0125

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)   2.9875     0.0373    80.1   <2e-16

Residual standard error: 0.745 on 398 degrees of freedom
~~~

The model with *no* data variables is much simpler, and appears to fit as well or better. We can compare the models' prediction accuracy on the dataset (lower is better in mean-squared-error):

~~~{.R}
mean((weather$MP - weather$MP)^2) # perfect
[1] 0
mean((weather$MP - model1$fitted.values)^2) # original
[1] 0.5321
mean((weather$MP - smodel1$fitted.values)^2) # simpler model
[1] 0.5537
~~~

### Random forests regression

Linear modeling having failed to reveal any interesting relationships, we'll take one last crack at it: if there's any interesting predictive power in the weather data at all, a high-powered machine learning technique like [random forests](!Wikipedia) ought to build a model which outperforms the linear model at least a little on mean-squared-error

~~~{.R}
library(randomForest)
rmodel <- randomForest(MP ~ ., data=weather[-1], proximity=TRUE); rmodel
...
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 7

          Mean of squared residuals: 0.5608
                    % Var explained: -1.29
~~~

The error with all variables is a little higher than the simpler linear model. Troublingly, a random forests with the simpler variables (the last two variables left in the `step` procedure before it deleted all of them) increases the error:

~~~{.R}
srmodel <- randomForest(MP ~ Max.Wind.SpeedMPH + PrecipitationIn, data=weather[-1], proximity=TRUE); srmodel
...
               Type of random forest: regression
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 1

          Mean of squared residuals: 0.6108
                    % Var explained: -9.17
~~~

Perhaps treating MP as a continuous variable was a bad idea. Let's start over.

### Categorical MP

We turn the MP data into an ordered factor:

~~~{.R}
weather$MP <- ordered(weather$MP)
~~~

#### Logistic model

A straight [logistic regression](!Wikipedia) (`glm(MP ~ ., data=weather[-1], family="binomial")`) is not appropriate because MP is not a binary outcome; we use the [nnet](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnet/index.html) library to do an ordinal multinomial logistic regression; as with the linear model, the coefficients don't seem to differ very much

~~~{.R}
library(nnet)
lmodel <- multinom(MP ~ ., data = weather[-1], maxit=150)
# relative risk or odds; how much difference between categories is there?
exp(coef(lmodel))
  (Intercept) Max.TemperatureF Mean.TemperatureF Min.TemperatureF Max.Dew.PointF MeanDew.PointF
2   3.550e+01            16.71          0.004009            21.55          1.387         0.4164

Another use of `step`; this time, it builds something more interesting than a constant predictor:

~~~{.R}
slmodel <- step(lmodel); summary(slmodel)
...
multinom(formula = MP ~ Mean.TemperatureF + Min.TemperatureF,
    data = weather[-1], maxit = 150)

Coefficients:
  (Intercept) Mean.TemperatureF Min.TemperatureF
2       4.977           -0.2965           0.3161
3       5.052           -0.2060           0.2222
4       4.715           -0.2509           0.2692

2       2.582            0.1770           0.1760
3       2.563            0.1748           0.1737
4       2.580            0.1766           0.1755

Residual Deviance: 868.6
AIC: 886.6
~~~

#### Random forests classification

Random forests can be used to classify (predict categorical outcomes) as well as regressions; having turned the response variable into a factor, the type switches automatically:

~~~{.R}
rmodel <- randomForest(MP ~ ., data=weather[-1], proximity=TRUE); rmodel
...
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 4

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 57.89%
Confusion matrix:
  1  2   3  4 class.error
1 0  0   4  0      1.0000
2 0 11  84  6      0.8911
3 0 21 142 27      0.2526
4 0  7  82 15      0.8558
~~~

We can't `step` through random forests since it doesn't have a complexity measure like AIC to use, so we'll reuse the variables from the simplified multinomial:

~~~{.R}
srmodel <- randomForest(MP ~ Mean.TemperatureF + Min.TemperatureF, data=weather[-1], proximity=TRUE); srmodel
...
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 1

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 60.4%
Confusion matrix:
  1  2   3  4 class.error
1 0  0   3  1      1.0000
2 0 17  60 24      0.8317
3 0 24 117 49      0.3842
4 1 19  60 24      0.7692
~~~

No improvement; perhaps the forests were benefiting from the other data variables.


#### Multinomial vs Random forests

We can now compare the fraction of days that are incorrectly predicted by the constant predictor, the logistic regression (full & simplified), and the random forests (full & simplified):

~~~{.R}
1 - (sum(weather$MP==3) / length(weather$MP))
[1] 0.5238

1 - (sum(weather$MP == as.ordered(predict(lmodel))) / length(weather$MP))
[1] 0.4887
1 - (sum(weather$MP == as.integer(predict(slmodel))) / length(weather$MP))
[1] 0.5213

1 - (sum(as.integer(weather$MP) == as.integer(predict(rmodel))) / length(weather$MP))
[1] 0.5789
1 - (sum(as.integer(weather$MP) == as.integer(predict(srmodel))) / length(weather$MP))
[1] 0.604
~~~

It would seem that the logistic regression is equivalent or better than the constant predictor, and the random forests does worse than either.

### Model checking

Before concluding that the logistic regression is better than the constant predictor, it might be a good idea to check how robust this result holds up. The difference in correctly classified days is very small, and it might represent minimal advantage. We'll [bootstrap](!Wikipedia "Bootstrapping (statistics)") a large number of logistic regressions on samples of the full dataset, and see what fraction of them incur a higher classification error rate than the constant predictor:

~~~{.R}
library(boot)
classify <- function(dt, indices) {
  d <- dt[indices,] # allows boot to select subsample
  lmodel <- multinom(MP ~ ., data = d, maxit=200, trace=FALSE) # train new regression model on subsample
  return(1 - (sum(as.integer(dt$MP) == as.integer(predict(lmodel, newdata=dt))) / length(dt$MP)))
}
bs <- boot(data=weather[-1], statistic=classify, R=10000); bs

hist(bs$t, xlab="Error rate", ylab="Number of samples", main="Bootstrap check of logistic regression accuracy")
sum(bs$t > (1 - (sum(weather$MP==3) / length(weather$MP)))) / length(bs$t)
[1] 0.7124

~~~

![Distribution of logistic regression classification rates](/images/2013-weather-bootstrap.png)

There's substantial uncertainty in the classification rate, as evidence by the potentially wide confidence intervals, but in ~71% of the new logistic regressions, the classification rate was worse than the constant predictor (and in a few, the error rate is extremely high). This confirms the fragility claim and suggests that the regression is unlikely to be finding any meaningful signal in the weather noise.

# Conclusion

An attack on the data turned up nothing in several ways; the only model that seemed to improve on random guessing turned out to look mostly like a fluke.
