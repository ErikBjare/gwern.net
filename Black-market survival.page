I am interested in websites selling drugs over Tor or i2p, using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin, allowing multiple sellers other than the site operators, and providing some sort of escrow functionality. This excludes clearnet sites like Topix, single-vendor shops like Modern Culture or Bungee54, carding shops like Tor Carders Market, hosting services like Cryuserv or Bad Wolf, black-market-focused forums like The Hub, and forums for buyers & sellers to deal directly with each other like The Majestic Garden.

Silk Road Reloaded seems to've been abandoned. RAMP, Magic Shop, Silkk are excluded because they're in Russian or Finnish and I can't get good information about them. DrugMarket (`4yjes6zfucnh7vcj.onion`) is excluded because it reportedly has always been a scam. The Majestic Garden & Underground Market Board 3.0 are excluded because they are forums and do not do escrow for their users.

Variables:

- start/end dates are, when possible, the date of the first & last known sales/withdrawals; otherwise they are rounded to my first/last visit to them; or to the start/end of the month they appeared/disappeared
- closure: whether the shut down was due to law enforcement, precipitated by a hack or de-anonymization, a scam/theft by operators, or voluntary (without known losses to users)
- multisig: 2-of-3 escrow; 2-of-2 and other 'lite' versions are not considered multisig because they still allow for thefts
- hacks: number of publicly known hacks resulting in leaks of user information, loss of funds, etc
- doxed: whether a plausible candidate for site operators has been made publicly known by law enforcement or other people
- codebase: the origin of the source code for a site where anything is publicly known; 'custom' simply means the site operators seem to have written it themselves
- guns: whether firearms were sold, specified in rules/policies as allowed to be sold, or rules/policies specified there were no bans on item categories
- fraud: whether carding items like credit card dumps were sold etc (this does not include fake IDs or informational guides on how to commit fraud; the former have uses besides carding, and the latter are often outdated or just scams)

<!-- "The death rate of bitwasp marketplaces will always be higher because it lowers the barrier of entry to starting and launching your own BTC marketplace so less technical people with lesser funds to start the marketplace will use it and that demographic has a higher chance of failure."

From a predictive standpoint, it doesn't much matter why Bitwasp correlates with shorter lifetimes - whether it's through greater likelihood of being hacked or self-selection by weakwilled/poor/uncommitted/incompetent operators. As long as it does, it'll improve predictions by predicting shorter lifetimes for Bitwasp-using marketplaces, and so it's less safe for buyers: even if the marketplace is using multisig, there's still some limited scope for an exit scam; it wastes one's investment in learning how to use a marketplace; and sellers lose any bond they put up. (Multisig is great and I've been advocating for it for a long time, but it's not a silver bullet.)

In any case, I can try checking if using Bitwasp correlates with being hacked, not just shut down. The sample is currently small enough that the results won't mean much regardless, though. -->
