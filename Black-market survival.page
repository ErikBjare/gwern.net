title: Black-market risks
description: Analysis of lifespans, deaths, and predictive factors

...

> I compile a dataset of 53 black-markets in the vein of the famous [Silk Road](Silk Road), recording their openings/closing and relevant characteristics. A survival analysis indicates the markets follow a Type TODO lifespan, with a median life of TODO months. Risk factors include TODO. With the best model, I generate estimates for the currently-operating markets.

I am interested in websites selling drugs over Tor or i2p, using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin, allowing multiple sellers other than the site operators, and providing some sort of escrow functionality. This excludes clearnet sites like Topix, single-vendor shops like Modern Culture or Bungee54, carding shops like Tor Carders Market, hosting services like Cryuserv or Bad Wolf, black-market-focused forums like The Hub, and forums for buyers & sellers to deal directly with each other like The Majestic Garden.

Silk Road Reloaded seems to've been abandoned; RAMP, Magic Shop, Silkk are excluded because they're in Russian or Finnish and I can't get good information about them; DrugMarket is excluded because it reportedly has always been a scam; the Majestic Garden & Underground Market Board 3.0 are excluded because they are forums & do not do escrow for their users.

# Data

Variables:

- start/end dates are, when possible, the date of the first & last known sales/withdrawals; otherwise they are rounded to my first/last visit to them; or to the start/end of the month they appeared/disappeared
- closure: whether the shut down was due to law enforcement, precipitated by a hack or de-anonymization, a scam/theft by operators, or voluntary (without known losses to users)
- multisig: whether 2-of-3 escrow supported; 2-of-2 and other 'lite' versions are not considered multisig because they still allow for thefts
- i2p: whether i2p is used in addition/instead of Tor
- hacks: number of publicly known hacks resulting in leaks of user information, loss of funds, etc
- doxed: whether a plausible candidate for site operators has been made publicly known by law enforcement or other people
- codebase: the origin of the source code for a site where anything is publicly known; 'custom' simply means the site operators seem to have written it themselves
- coin: principal cryptocurrency of marketplace; if multiple coins are accepted, I list the most prominent altcoin
- guns: whether firearms were sold, specified in rules/policies as allowed to be sold, or rules/policies specified there were no bans on item categories
- fraud: whether carding items like credit card dumps were sold etc (this does not include fake IDs or informational guides on how to commit fraud; the former have uses besides carding, and the latter are often outdated or just scams)
- RoI: the 30-day return-on-investment of Bitcoin as decimal; extracted from Eli Dourado's [btcvol.info](http://btcvol.info/)'s [historical CSV](http://btcvol.info/csv); it is based on the [Coindesk index](http://www.coindesk.com/price/?bpi=bpi). For exact computation, see the appendix.
- σ/[volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_%28finance%29): the 30-day volatility of Bitcoin prices on the day a marketplace is considered dead (decimal),

BlackMarket Reloaded     2011-06-30 2013-12-02 FALSE hacked    `r6rcmz6lga4i5vb4.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   custom     TRUE   TRUE  1     FALSE  4.170 0.102  backopy stopped buying on 2 Dec aggravated in part by a big theft, fully shutdown by 23 December. May reopen. BMR permitted gun sales, and also seems to have permitted credit card information sales, judging by angry feedback.
Atlantis                 2013-03-26 2013-09-20 FALSE scam      `atlantisrky4es5q.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC              FALSE  FALSE 0     FALSE  0.103 0.024  Atlantis's shutdown seems, judging by comments [on](http://www.reddit.com/r/atlantis/comments/1n5a2q/the_fall_of_atlantis_a_moderator_tells/) [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/atlantis/comments/1ms7f9/alert_atlantis_marketplace_closing_down/) [pages](http://www.reddit.com/r/atlantis/comments/1n3qc7/atlantis_is_it_site_down_for_good/) & [All Things Vice](http://allthingsvice.com/2013/09/26/the-fall-of-atlantis-a-moderator-tells/) to have initially allowed withdrawals, but disabled it after a few days and then stole the remaining deposits+escrow+vendor-bonds.
Sheep Marketplace        2013-02-28 2013-11-29 FALSE scam      `sheep5u64fi457aw.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Nette      FALSE  TRUE  1     TRUE   4.759 0.093  withdrawals were halted before 29 Nov, but deposits & sales were ongoing. I choose 29 Nov as the day where the Sheep scam became irrefutable
Deepbay                  2013-06-30 2013-11-04 FALSE scam      `deepbay4xr3sw2va.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC                           0     FALSE  0.859 0.035  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qaewa/deepbay_marketplace_owner_steals_sites_bitcoins/

Project Black Flag       2013-10-14 2013-10-28 FALSE scam      `ajd4yqq7ngzmqo3p.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   custom     FALSE  TRUE  1     FALSE  0.506 0.063  http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1peguv/pbf_rip/ ; forums: `blackiiw5nozs6i5.onion`; policies stated on forums ("Prohibited: Weapons, counterfeit money, stolen goods, child pornography, posting other users information, attempt to cause harm, spamming.")
TorMarket                2013-11-07 2013-12-22 FALSE scam      `tormarkozaegyvco.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC              FALSE  TRUE  1     FALSE -0.173 0.127   Part of the TorMarket user list was leaked by DPR2 on SRF2; further rumors that TorMarket's shut down was precipitated by a hack by Profesorhouse have not been substantiated. TM may have used Bitwasp, but it didn't seem to [have Bitwasp error pages](http://bit-wasp.org/index.php/topic,130.0.html) and doesn't really look like the usual Bitwasp black-market.
FloMarket                2013-12-01 2014-01-01 FALSE hacked    `fmkt3wixc772jxyj.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Bitwasp                 2     FALSE -0.258 0.118   Apparently [hacked 20 December 2013](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=10489.msg191044#msg191044) (previously [noted to be hackable](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1tm4rf/be_careful_with_flomarket_and_bluesky/)); withdrawals began failing [on 1 January 2014](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/01/02/warning-reports-of-flomarket-possible-scam-hack/) & FloMarket announced a [*second*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1ujjsw/flo_is_down_for_good_another_scam_in_the_books/) hack on 6 January 2014; for the operator's explanation, see [his interview](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/01/09/flomarket-admin-im-not-a-scammer-an-exculsive-interview/) <!-- ~5btc hack -->
Tortuga                  2013-12-16 2014-01-05 FALSE voluntary `tortugauwngwecwd.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Seagull                 0     FALSE  0.127 0.109   Advertised in the [SRF2](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=9940.msg179819#msg179819) on 19 Dec; advertised on the [BMR forums](/docs/sr/2013-12-16-bmr-tortugannouncement.mht) on 16 Dec. Up on 1 January 2014, down on 9 January 2014 & afterwards. [No news](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1vhygj/tortuga_gone/) about reasons for its closure.
BlackBox Market          2013-11-12 2014-02-01 FALSE voluntary `77yqlxe7pnxhnxvi.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC              TRUE   TRUE  0     FALSE  0.056 0.047   Interesting site, but not sure it should be listed here. Start date based on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1qhj76/the_blackbox_market_legal_private_encrypted/). Site stopped responding 1 February 2014. On-site escrow did not use multisig ("We do not make use of the Escrow services provided by Bitcoin itself as this associates buyers and sellers.") Policies based on the fact that BBM could not know what was being sold on it and so _de facto_ permitted both categories.
GreyRoad                 2014-01-04 2014-02-01 FALSE voluntary `greyroaderw4qymd.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC              TRUE   TRUE  0     FALSE  0.056 0.047   Went public [4 January 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1ue777/ask_lord_voldemort_anything/) ([2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ue499/ask_lord_voldemort_anything/)), operator claims to have been selling for a while but refuses to provide any specifics & very few sellers on market so opening date is used; forums: `grforums5qwzbhkl.onion`. URL stopped working 1 February 2014
Cantina                  2014-01-20 2014-02-07 FALSE hacked    `vsudl2g3em6qhcw4.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Nette      TRUE   TRUE  3     TRUE  -0.182 0.030   Cantina [spammed vendors on SRF2](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=18574.0) on 20 Jan 2014; earliest known mention of the market. It was [repeatedly hacked & doxed](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1whket/cantina_market_mega_thread_up_vote_for_visibility/). Cantina had no stated policies, but it did have a category for guns and given the 'Data' categories & general lack of ethics & greed, highly likely would have permitted carding had it not died so ignominiously.
Breaking Bad             2014-02-01 2014-02-06 FALSE voluntary `breakingnartglxd.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   custom     TRUE   TRUE  0     FALSE -0.033 0.031   [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1wqhcm/breaking_bad/); site went down 6 February, [owner explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1wqhcm/breaking_bad/cfbmzy7) shutdown due to "Lack of interest from vendors, constant hate mail, downvotes and claims on security vulnerabilities"
Black Goblin Market      2014-02-03 2014-02-04 FALSE hacked    `ua4aptglh45m5p6b.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Drupal     TRUE   TRUE  0     TRUE  -0.104 0.043   [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1wwjg3/black_goblin_market_is_now_open/); I [de-anonymized the site](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1xeeni/black_goblin_obituary/), so it shut down. The "Black Goblin Rules" page does not mention any ban of guns or carding.
Cannabis Road            2014-02-03 2014-02-07 FALSE hacked    `ji4wrifhsnawaw7t.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   custom     FALSE  FALSE 1     TRUE  -0.182 0.030   Announced on The Hub; [thoroughly hacked & de-anonymized](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1xe943/cannabisroad_obituary/)

[Dutch seizure notice posted ~7:30AM EST](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1xltp2/utopia_seized_by_police/), followed by [5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26158012 "Five arrested in Utopia dark net marketplace crackdown") [arrests](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/12/the-utopia-bust-details-prosecution-announcement/ "The Utopia Bust Details - Prosecution Announcement") in Netherlands & [Germany](http://www.bka.de/nn_233148/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2014/140213__ErmittlungserfolgCyberKriminelle.html "Ermittlungserfolg gegen Cyber-Kriminelle")
Black Services Market    2013-12-02 2014-02-01 FALSE scam      `thebsm6okkbx7fik.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   OSclass    TRUE   TRUE  0     FALSE  0.056 0.047       Start date based on oldest listing when I checked on 26 December 2013; last admin forum post 18 Jan & PMs to him disabled, [reports](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1xbex3/bsm_black_services_market_is_a_scam/) of escrow problems in late Jan/early Feb, many complaints on forums; site went down 14 February 2014
Red Sun Marketplace      2014-03-20 2014-03-23 FALSE hacked    `redsun4lvjrxwwuy.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Bitwasp           TRUE  1     FALSE -0.014 0.046   [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/20vrlv/red_sun_marketplace_reloaded/); hacked ([SQli etc](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/214y14/i_made_it_all_pretty_and_stuff/cg9sh7z)); forum: `forumsyccj7ekvvv.onion`. Surviving materials don't say whether guns were permitted, but given the operator's [interest in recruiting fake ID vendors](http://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/20vusk/looking_for_id_card_vendors/) it seems more likely than not that carding sales would have been allowed.
BuyItNow                 2013-04-30 2014-02-17 FALSE voluntary `buyitnowquyft7dx.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Wordpress  TRUE   FALSE 0     FALSE -0.263 0.040   Site did not respond on 17 February 2014 or afterwards; no reports on shutdown reason or whether it was a scam. Policies not specified, but many listings for guns, and none of any kind related to carding.
White Rabbit             2013-12-23 2014-02-01 FALSE scam      `rabbittorvr74veg.onion` FALSE    TRUE  LTC              TRUE   TRUE  0     TRUE   0.056 0.047   Start date based on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/themarketplace/comments/1to7sk/a_new_alternative_themarketplace/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1to8d7/a_new_alternative_sr/). Formerly named "Rabbit's Marketplace". Unable to find reports of successful sales on The Hub or Reddit, and WR withdrawal has been broken at least since 21 February 2014; [no one has claimed withdrawals](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1ylbt7/why_is_whiterabbit_in_side_bar/) recently. Dead date is based on the February news notice "There are problems with payment gateway". Forum states only CP is banned ("Items which are not allowed: child porn (and other sick stuff).") i2p: `wrmarket.i2p`. IP was found to [be leaking](http://thehub7dnl5nmcz5.onion/index.php?topic=2261.msg17459).
FreeBay                  2013-12-02 2014-02-28 FALSE voluntary `freebay3yxuebsog.onion` FALSE    FALSE LTC              FALSE  TRUE  0     FALSE -0.351 0.048   URL is also apparently `litebay7vp5pm77f.onion`; open date is guess based on [Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1s0wgc/freebay_ebay_of_drugs/); site was not up on 28 February 2014 when I checked. Policies not specified, but many carding & no gun listings.

Doge Road                2014-01-18 2014-03-13 FALSE scam      `dogeroadiqt6olb6.onion` FALSE    FALSE DOGE  Bitwasp    FALSE  TRUE  0     FALSE -0.047 0.057   [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1vjxap/xpost_rdogecoin_announcement_the_doge_road_is_now/); forums: `dogeroadqmu2yzcg.onion`. Went down [sometime in March 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/20duht/drugslist_dogeroad_kia_admins_mia/), may have gone bad in late February.
TorEscrow                2014-02-02 2014-04-19 FALSE scam      `torescrow7upglhe.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC              FALSE  TRUE  0     FALSE -0.145 0.074   Initially just an escrow, but [TE expanded](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1wt3bj/te_expands_and_becomes_a_market/) into a market. Forums: `4rtvonaubslk7vvk.onion`. TE seems to have permitted carding: "We do not allow the sale of weapons, pornography, ebooks, pirated software or hits."
Armory Vendor Market     2014-02-06 2014-04-07 FALSE scam      `armoryx7kvdq3jds.onion` FALSE    FALSE DRK   Quick.Cart TRUE   FALSE 1     FALSE -0.275 0.046   [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1x855s/the_armory_vendor_market_is_now_open/); their Cryuserv hosting, according to the hacker, dated back to 23 May 2013 but it's unclear when they had their first sale. It announced use of [Darkcoin in March 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1zz4h0/the_armory_new_currency_accepted_darkcoin/).
Darknet Nation           2014-02-19 2014-03-01 FALSE hacked    `26a2ueoc3xxrrgs4.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Joomla     TRUE   TRUE  0     TRUE  -0.334 0.049   [Announced on Reddit](https://pay.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1yev3e/introducing_darknet_nation/); [Q&A](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/02/21/darknet-nation-darknetmarket-social-network/). The site leaked its IP address. Down 3 April 2014; best guess, shut down sometime in March (the admin's last post on The Hub was [1 March 2014](http://thehub7dnl5nmcz5.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=1663).)
Sanitarium Market        2014-02-20 2014-03-28 FALSE voluntary `sanitarium-market.i2p`  FALSE    TRUE  BTC   Bitwasp                 0     FALSE -0.129 0.052   [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1yfvkl/sanitariummarket_i2p/); long address: `dhd5okd2imkskbhsrlbs5c4nx3cdtmwpplvcei6o3l2sc35kt4ma.b32.i2p`; Tor mirror: `nyu7nlbj33ym2va3.onion`. Unreachable by DeepDotWeb 28 March 2014, and [last subreddit activity](http://www.reddit.com/r/sanitariummarket/new/) was 19 March 2014. The operator claimed on [24 February 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/sanitariummarket/comments/1yt3zm/multisig_transactions/) to have integrated multisig but I can't find any reports of use of it.
Hansa                    2014-03-09 2014-03-20 FALSE voluntary `hansann7wim5ier2.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Bitwasp    TRUE   TRUE  0     TRUE  -0.056 0.050    [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1zzwrd/hansa_new_tor_marketplace_platform_pgp_2factor/) & [de-anonymized](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/207mk9/hansamarkets_ip_address/); closure date based on last transaction [by their IP](http://blockchain.info/ip-address/46.4.128.75). They planned to implement multisig but seem to have shut down before it went live. Bitwasp classification based on [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/207mk9/hansamarkets_ip_address/cg18l3j) [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/201z39/trade_with_0_fee_on_hansa_till_the_end_of_the_week/cfz78jw) & [screenshot of login page](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/03/12/another-market-doxxed-hansamarket/).

No information about policies is available, although since it seems to've been run by Sanitarium, it likely had whatever they did.
Mr Nice Guy              2014-03-29 2014-04-20 FALSE voluntary `niceguymn4plorwb.onion` FALSE    FALSE BTC   Bitwasp    FALSE  FALSE 0     TRUE  -0.129 0.075    [Announced on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/21op6t/we_are_pleased_to_announce_our_new_market/); forum: `ngforumjj4dkis7w.onion`.

I may add to the table other variables; possibly useful ones:

- 2-factor-authentication
- Vendor PGP enforced
- FE status
- ideology: whether the operator seems ideological (I theorize SR1 may have lasted longer than most post-SR1 markets because Ulbricht's agorist ideology meant he was not profit-motivated & refused to do an exit scam or shutdown)
- volume (at what time?)
- how much money was lost when the site scammed or was hacked (only reasonably known for a few scams...)
- apparent nationality of operator
- media coverage
- number of employees (can official claims be trusted?)
- fully-separate buyer/seller accounts

# Analysis

TODO:

>> "The death rate of bitwasp marketplaces will always be higher because it lowers the barrier of entry to starting and launching your own BTC marketplace so less technical people with lesser funds to start the marketplace will use it and that demographic has a higher chance of failure."
>
> From a predictive standpoint, it doesn't much matter why Bitwasp correlates with shorter lifetimes - whether it's through greater likelihood of being hacked or self-selection by weakwilled/poor/uncommitted/incompetent operators. As long as it does, it'll improve predictions by predicting shorter lifetimes for Bitwasp-using marketplaces, and so it's less safe for buyers: even if the marketplace is using multisig, there's still some limited scope for an exit scam; it wastes one's investment in learning how to use a marketplace; and sellers lose any bond they put up. (Multisig is great and I've been advocating for it for a long time, but it's not a silver bullet.)
>
> In any case, I can try checking if using Bitwasp correlates with being hacked, not just shut down. The sample is currently small enough that the results won't mean much regardless, though.
