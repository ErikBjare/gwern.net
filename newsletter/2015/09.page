- ["The Bayesian Reproducibility Project"](http://alexanderetz.com/2015/08/30/the-bayesian-reproducibility-project/) (interpreting the psychology reproducibility projects' results not by uninterpretable _p_-values but by a direct Bayesian examination of whether the replications support or contradict the originals)

- [Galton's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton%27s_problem) (Another name for pseudoreplication/autocorrelation/hierarchical-structure/non-independence. Definitely a concern in cross-racial genetics when you're using population-level averages.)

- ["The Evolutionary Genetics of Personality"](http://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/newpapers_sept6/penke%202007%20targetarticle.pdf), Penke et al 2007 (holds up well after the GWASes for IQ & OCEAN; although prediction that OCEAN hits will be more plentiful than IQ seems to have fallen victim to personality being somewhat more polygenic than expected & non-additive)
