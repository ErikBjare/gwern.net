# Writing

Technically, rewriting the site to use Hakyll-4 as a static site generator and converting the repository from Darcs to Git were major pieces of technical debt I needed to pay off. Very painful, but it had to be done. I was also pleased to finish my annotated ebook of _Radiance_: I think it's an unjustly obscure piece of literary scientific fiction which shines even more when the historical context is laid out.
My [public release of the Mnemosyne spaced repetition dataset](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mnemosyne-proj-users/tPHlkTFVX_4/oF61BF44iQkJ) is something I'm proud of - the last release was inaccessible despite being a throve of data on flashcards in the real world.
The sort-key trick ([Spatial locality for better file compression](Archiving URLs#sort---key-compression-trick)) was originally just a random command-line trick, but in working with the black-market scrapes, I've come to appreciate how it yields major space savings. (I haven't finished any writings on the black-markets lately, but I have been amusing myself inordinately by trying to write some [epigrams on them & technology in general](Notes#technology-epigrams).)
My [McCaleb email interview on MtGox](/docs/2014-mccaleb) helped set the record straight on Wikipedia about the history of MtGox. And not a moment too soon, given how toxic the topic is now for anyone previously associated with it.

## Newsletter

Somewhat to my surprise, each month I was able to compile & send out a newsletter stuffed full of links and other things:

- [January](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/01)
- [February](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/02)
- [March](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/03)
- [April](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/04)
- [May](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/05)
- [June](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/06)
- [July](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/07)
- [August](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/08)
- [September](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/09)
- [October](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/10)
- [November](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/11)
- [December](http://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2014/12)

Putting them together was a lot of work, but thus far it seems to be worth it: I am up to ~450 subscribers, most of whom click on at least one or two links, and I suspect most would not follow the RSS feed or my Google+ profile.

# Personal

2014 was an eventful year.
Bitcoin continued evolving towards respectability despite the MtGox disaster (which I think surprised even the more cynical observers), and the technical possibilities continue to be explored (I particularly like sidechains and Truthcoin).
The black-market scene saw dizzying turnover as markets continued to rise and fall in the post-SR1 vacuum (although in many cases, the fall was no less than merited) with 42 new markets and 46 closures.
Monitoring them all, much less scraping them, has proven to be quite a challenge, but I now have fairly complete archives which I have distributed to a number of academics; with luck, I can do a public release in 2015.
This all drew some media attention as well; I did interviews in person or over email with Mike Power, the NHK, and Erica Fink.

My dog died on 6 February. He was old and nearly blind but it was still sad. I got a new cat in June from the pound after considerable travails with local animal rescue groups. I named him Oolong - like the tea, his fur color shifts between brown and black.
I spent time weatherproofing / sealing my apartment's doors and windows (blacking out the bedroom windows and putting springs on the doors while I was at it), and upgrading the antique DSL Internet to a cable modem; while still pathetic by any First World country's standards, it helps a lot.
I also have been learning to bake sourdough bread - when I visited my sister in San Francisco, I really enjoyed the Bowdoin sourdough bread, and there seemed no reason I couldn't learn to bake some myself.
Some home improvements worked, others didn't (the hammock seems to be a summer-only thing; and my data logger shows the humidifier was completely unnecessary - rather, excess humidity is causing mold), and the jury is still out on others (installing much brighter CFL light bulbs to counteract winter dimness).
