- ["Autism As a Disorder of High Intelligence"](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2016.00300/full), Crespi 2016 (Seems to overemphasize the role of common variants and underplay all the severe de novo mutations discovered in autism cases.﻿)

Politics/religion:

- ["Preparing for the Possibility of a North Korean Collapse"](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR300/RR331/RAND_RR331.pdf), Bennett 2013 (I didn't know many of those details about how the East German collapse was able to go so smoothly, or that Kim Jong-Il had intimidated his subordinates during the '90s famines with footage of impoverished East German elites.﻿)

AI:

- ["Assessing Human Error Against a Benchmark of Perfection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04956) (Difficulty of a chess endgame position predicts mistakes far better than time constraints or chess ability. Not necessarily surprising - as chess AIs demonstrate, humans only span a fraction of the possible range of objective chess playing ability, so individual human differences in ability won't matter much.﻿)

Fiction:

## Film/TV

Live-action:

Anime:

- [_Yurikuma Arashi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurikuma_Arashi) (another peculiar Ikuhara production. It carries over much of his style in coloring and background and inscrutable symbolism from [_Revolutionary Girl Utena_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena) & [_Mawaru Penguindrum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguindrum). YA is far more inscrutable through to episode 5, where finally enlightenment begins; then everything is explained to an extent unusual for Ikuhara. Stated baldly, his thesis of true love saving the world is not nearly as interesting as the fancy garments he cloaks it in. Combined with the irritating characters, I suspect this may partially account for why YA was unsatisfying & unpopular.)
