Everything is heritable:

- Human evolution:

    - ["Divergent Ah receptor ligand selectivity during hominin evolution"](http://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/2016-hubbard.pdf), Hubbard et al 2016 (Evolution to tolerate smoke poisoning, 350-45kya)
    - ["Genetic Markers of Human Evolution Are Enriched in Schizophrenia"](http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223%2815%2900855-0/pdf), Srinivasan et al 2016 (Our evolution is not yet complete: evolution is still working out the kinks. Fortunately, we don't have to wait for it to finish the job.)
    - ["Genetic Associations Between Personality Traits and Lifetime Reproductive Success in Humans"](http://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/2016-berg.pdf), Berg et al 2016 (contemporary selection for personality traits)
    - ["Humans Never Stopped Evolving: The emergence of blood abnormalities, an adult ability to digest milk, and changes in our physical appearance point to the continued evolution of the human race"](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46651/title/Humans-Never-Stopped-Evolving/)
- ["Identification of 15 genetic loci associated with risk of major depression in individuals of European descent"](http://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/2016-hyde.pdf), Hyde et al 2016
- ["Sweet Taste Perception is Associated with Body Mass Index at the Phenotypic and Genotypic Level"](http://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/2016-hwang.pdf), Hwang et al 2016

Politics/religion:

- ["Evolution is Not Relevant to Sex Differences in Humans Because I Want it That Way! Evidence for the Politicization of Human Evolutionary Psychology"](http://www.evostudies.org/pdf/GeherVol2Iss1.pdf), Geher & Gambacorta 2016
- ["Science Is Not Always "Self-Correcting": Fact-Value Conflation and the Study of Intelligence"](http://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-cofnas.pdf), Cofnas 2015 (scientific endorsement of the Noble Lie)
Academia, liberalism, and propensity to blank slate beliefs like believing hens & roosters differ due to nurture:
- ["Insane. Invisible. In danger. Florida cut $100 million from its mental hospitals. Chaos quickly followed"](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/florida-mental-health-hospitals/)

AI:

Statistics/meta-science:

- ["How Multiple Imputation Makes a Difference"](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ranjitlall/files/pa_website_version_1.pdf?platform=hootsuite), Lall 2016 (many political science results biased & driven by treatment of missing data)

Psychology/biology:

- ["Heads or tails: the impact of a coin toss on major life decisions and subsequent happiness"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22487), Levitt 2016 (You can randomize anything if you're sufficiently clever about it - even having babies, quitting jobs, moving, or starting a business. Arguably, like computer chess or 'comfort zone expansion', this suggests humans may be too risk-averse: the people on the margin, the 6% who apparently could be swayed by a coin flip, should be making these decisions more often, suggesting a bias towards the status quo.) TODO: track down fulltext, the NBER copy has gone full paywall

Technology:

- ["Strategy Letter V"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html) (Reminder: Android vs iPhone, Oculus vs Vive, Microsoft vs Apple, Facebook vs media, Twitter vs API users, Amazon vs anything - everything in SV is ruled by 'commoditize your complement' and low marginal costs.)

Economics:

Philosophy:

Fiction:

Misc:

- ["Detailed Discussion of Legal Rights and Duties in Lost Pet Disputes"](https://www.animallaw.info/article/detailed-discussion-legal-rights-and-duties-lost-pet-disputes), Berry 2010 (lost/abandoned pets are surprisingly complex legally)
