Statistics/meta-science:

- ["How Multiple Imputation Makes a Difference"](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ranjitlall/files/pa_website_version_1.pdf?platform=hootsuite), Lall 2016 (many political science results biased & driven by treatment of missing data)

- ["Heads or tails: the impact of a coin toss on major life decisions and subsequent happiness"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22487), Levitt 2016 (You can randomize anything if you're sufficiently clever about it - even having babies, quitting jobs, moving, or starting a business. Arguably, like computer chess or 'comfort zone expansion', this suggests humans may be too risk-averse: the people on the margin, the 6% who apparently could be swayed by a coin flip, should be making these decisions more often, suggesting a bias towards the status quo.) TODO: track down fulltext, the NBER copy has gone full paywall

Technology:

- ["Strategy Letter V"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html) (Reminder: Android vs iPhone, Oculus vs Vive, Microsoft vs Apple, Facebook vs media, Twitter vs API users, Amazon vs anything - everything in SV is ruled by 'commoditize your complement' and low marginal costs.)

Philosophy:

Fiction:

Misc:
