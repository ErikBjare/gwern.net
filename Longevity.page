We all want to live longer, but I find most discussions of available interventions unsatisfying because they tend to ignore any consideration of whether the intervention is too expensive (as the joke goes about veganism, you may live longer but will you want to?), and be simultaneously too gullible (nutrition research; looking at any health parameter which improves) and too narrow-minded (I don't care if an intervention has _p_>0.05 if that still means a 90% probability of benefit).

What I would like to see is a practical guide, taking a decision theory perspective, which follows a procedure something like the following, in taking interventions which:

1. reduce [all-cause mortality](!Wikipedia),

    ACM is the end-point of choice for life-extension because it is both closest to what we care about (additional life) and it is the hardest of all end-points - it is difficult to cheat, miscount, or not notice, and by being simple, consistent, and unambiguous, avoids many failure modes such as subgroup hacking or dropping outliers or tweaking covariates (either a larger fraction of the controls are dead or not). It also can typically be extracted from most studies, even if they otherwise fail to report much of the data.

    From a benefit point of view, average reduction in all-cause mortality is excellent for  ignoring any zero-sum tradeoffs: it's no good if reported benefits are only because the doctors writing up a trial kept slicing deaths by different categorizations of causes until they finally found a _p_<0.05 or if the gains only appear by excluding some deaths as 'irrelevant' or if the gains in one cause of death comes at the expense of another cause (is it really helpful to avoid death by heart attack if the intervention just means you die of cancer instead?).
    For example, one primate study of caloric restriction found benefits only if it [excluded a bunch of deaths in the CR group](http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2009/07/calorie-restrictive-eating-for-longer.html) and defined them as not age-related, ignoring "monkeys who died while taking blood samples under anesthesia, from injuries or from infections, such as gastritis and endometriosis." (Even in the [followup paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140401/ncomms4557/full/ncomms4557.html "'Caloric restriction reduces age-related and all-cause mortality in rhesus monkeys', Colman et al 2015") several years later, the all-cause mortality reduction is much smaller than the "age-related" subcategory.) From a life-extension perspective, it is irrelevant if an intervention reduces some kinds of diseases while making one much more prone to dying from routine causes such as injuries or minor operations under anesthesia (especially since, in modern societies, one is guaranteed to be operated on at *some* point) - it either reduces all-cause mortality or it doesn't.
2. as estimated in randomized trials,

    [Correlation is not causation](/Causality) and correlates only rarely turn out to be usefully causal. With aging, the situation is especially severe since aging is the exponential increase in mortality with time as all bodily systems gradually begin to fail; one cannot simply take a correlation of some chemical with aging or mortality and expect an intervention on it to have more than a minute chance of making a difference, since almost *every* chemical or substance or biomarker will change with age (eg papers on magnesium levels often note that surprisingly, blood levels of magnesium *don't* change substantially with age). Worse, over more than a century of concerted effort and tinkering with a bewildering variety of thousands of interventions from injecting embryos to consuming testicles (or crushing one's own) to yogurt to yoga, it can safely be said that (almost?) all tried interventions have failed, and the prior odds are strongly against any new one.
3. on healthy adult human populations

    Studies of interventions in the sick are also unhelpful, as (hopefully!) the benefits observed may come from their particular disorder being treated. Animal studies are also unhelpful as [results cross-species are highly unreliable](/DNB%20FAQ#fn95) and model organisms may age in entirely different manner from humans, who are unusually long-lived as it is. One challenge for this criteria is studies done in elderly populations: because death rates are so high, they offer higher power to detect reductions in mortality; but because that death rate is pushed so high due to the aging process, they will tend to have many chronic conditions and diseases as well. Do we ignore studies recruiting from, for example, 70-90yos who all inherently have health problems? I would say it's probably better to err on the side of inclusion here as long as subjects were not selected for any particular health problem.
4. for which there are enough trials to do a random-effects/multilevel model, so one can extract a posterior predictive interval of the benefit,

    It's important to include heterogeneity from population to population as part of the uncertainty. One of the subtleties often missed in dealing with modeling is that a 95% CI around a parameter is not a CI around the outcome or result.
5. letting one compare mortality reduction against intervention cost,

    For making decisions, the costs of the intervention must be taken into account. A taxing exercise regimen may be proven to increase longevity, but is that of any value of the regimen takes away much more of your life than it gives back? It may be that no matter whether our certainty is 99% or 99.99% that it works, we would never choose to embark on that regimen. On the other hand, for a cheap enough intervention, we may be willing to accept substantially lower probability: baby aspirin, for example, costs \$7 & <10 seconds each morning / <60 minutes a year and we might be willing to use it if our final probability of any benefit is a mere 50%.
6. then yielding an expected value of the intervention (and if <\$0, perhaps further analysis about whether it has a reasonable chance of ever becoming profitable and what the Value of Information might be of further trials)

If an intervention passes all these criteria, we can be highly confident that we will gain life, rather than lose it.

Of course, these criteria are stringent: we can, for example, exclude almost everything which might appear in an issue of _Life Extension Magazine_ for being too small, conducted in animals, conducted in sick patients, not being a randomized experiment at all, or reporting benefits only on an extremely specific biological endpoint like some cholesterol-related metric you've never heard of.
Medical journals don't offer rich pickings either, as they understandably tend to focus on experiments done in sick people rather than healthy people (apparently there's more funding for the former - who knew?).
And when a randomized experiment *is* done in healthy adult humans, the experiment may either be too small or have run for too short a time, since annual mortality rates for many participant groups are 1% or less; for any sort of effect to show up, you want (very expensive, very rare) studies which enroll at least a thousand subjects for a decade or more.
It would not be surprising if we must intone the ritual ending to all Cochrane Reviews, "there is insufficient evidence for a recommendation".

Fortunately, I do know of a few plausible candidate interventions.
For example, baby aspirin has been tested in what must be dozens of trials at this point (generally turning in RRs  like 0.90 or 0.95 in the meta-analyses), is almost too cheap to bother including the cost, and has minimal side-effects (rarely, internal bleeding); it would not be surprising if a cost-benefit indicated the best decision is taking baby aspirin.

Unfortunately, no one has done this sort of thing before, so for my own use, while not an expert on any of the interventions or on health economics in general, I thought I might try to sketch out some such analyses.

    while SPRINT can't be generalized to healthy middle-aged people, having inclusion criteria for past cardiovascular problems or being high risk, they did have as one of their inclusion criteria be >75. and the total mortality HR for the <75yos was 0.77, and for >75... 0.68. not statistically significant, but certainly not evidence that the reduction of blood pressure has a lesser or different effect in the healthy >75yos than the unhealthy <75yos

## Exclusions

Examples of interventions which are interesting to me or often come up, but which can't be evaluated or wouldn't ever be profitable, and reasons for exclusion:

- [caloric restriction](!Wikipedia):

    promising, but current randomized studies are too short to show any effect on mortality (eg in ["A 2-Year Randomized Controlled Trial of Human Caloric Restriction: Feasibility and Effects on Predictors of Health Span and Longevity" (the CALERIE study), Ravussin et al 2015](http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/9/1097.full), no one died, so there is no all-cause mortality estimate)
- [castration](!Wikipedia "Castration#Medical consequences"):

    [often reported](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lm4/effects_of_castration_on_the_life_expectancy_of/) to increase longevity. But we can reject it as practical for a number of reasons: too serious a reduction in quality of life (going well beyond the loss of sex), social ostracism, probably must be done before puberty for any benefits (when informed consent is impossible), may not be legal, not verified in any randomized trials (a concern because not all historical eunuch seem to show life expectancy gains; [Egyptian eunuchs reportedly](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lm4/effects_of_castration_on_the_life_expectancy_of/cogu) had severe losses), and at least one of the proposed mechanisms may have lost efficacy in the modern setting (greater resistance to infectious diseases)
- [rapamycin](!Wikipedia):

    famous for life-extension results in animal experiments (especially mice), but the animal experiment environments may be unrealistic (raised under controlled, sometimes [SPF](!Wikipedia "Specific-pathogen-free") conditions) and rapamycin's primary use in humans is as an immunosuppressant and has been linked with bad outcomes. Rapamycin may never undergo clinical trials in healthy adult humans because the risks are too great.
- [alcohol/ethanol](!Wikipedia "Long-term effects of alcohol consumption"):

    "a glass a day" has long been noted to correlate with longer life anywhere one looks, but the confounds for moderate responsible drinking are too noticeable to put much faith in it and the debate continues to rage. [It's troubling](http://davidroodman.com/blog/2015/05/01/are-the-benefits-of-moderate-drinking-a-myth/ "Are the benefits of moderate drinking a myth?") that the economics literature seems to find health benefits to taxing alcohol, and that the more powerful [Mendelian randomization](!Wikipedia) design (while far from infallible) show harm rather than benefit. But the real issue is that despite seeming like the easiest experiment ever to run (hand out free booze), there apparently are no randomized trials.

    (I might do alcohol anyway to get an idea of what the profitability would be like and how skeptical one must be to erase benefits.)

# Definitions
## Value of Life

The valuation of one year of life I am using here [is $50,000](!Wikipedia "Value of life#Life Value in the US"), due to its commonness and conservativeness (some valuations would be much higher, and so tend to favor the use of interventions).

## Population survival curve

To work with life expectancies and changes in it, I take a standard [Gompertz curve](!Wikipedia) model of age-related mortality, using a fit of the modern Dutch population given in [Cramer & Kaas 2013](https://www.uva.nl/binaries/content/assets/subsites/amsterdam-school-of-economics-research-institute/uva-econometrics/dp-2013/1303.pdf "Mortality hazard rates and life expectancy").

~~~{.R}
S <- function(t, RR=1) { exp(-((RR*0.000016443)/log(1.1124) * (1.1124^t - 1))) }
plot(sapply(0:120, S), xlab="Age", ylab="Fraction surviving")

# the `min` is because past age 104, hazard>1 which is wrong, so need a ceiling
H <- function(t, RR) { min(1, (0 + (RR*0.000016443)*1.1124^t)) }
~~~

![Population survival curve](/images/longevity/survivalcurve.png)

It is also useful to draw random samples from a Gompertz-distribution of age-at-deaths, which can be used for generative model-related things like power simulations:

~~~{.R}
rgompertz <- function(n, RR=1) {
    ageHazards <- sapply(0:120, function(t) { H(t, RR) })
    # for each possible age, randomly sample a life event according to that age's hazard;
    # then the subject dies at the age at which their first FALSE is found.
    # So `TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE` ~> died 4yo.
    deathAges <- replicate(n,
                  Position(`!`, sapply(ageHazards, function(h){sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), 1, prob=c(1-h, h))})))
    return(deathAges) }
## example uses:
mean(rgompertz(1000))
# [1] 77.705
mean(rgompertz(1000, RR=0.50))
# [1] 84.219
~~~

### Converting risk reduction to average life expectancy gain

However, interpreting an RR/OR/STR isn't as simple as "probability of death is reduced in each time period by 15%, we have average life expectancies of ~80, therefore, X will make me live an extra $0.15 \cdot 80=12$ years".
(The intuition here is that death rates increase so much with time that a one-off reduction in each period doesn't make a huge long-term difference. You can see that any constant intervention moves the curve up a little bit but does not flatten it.)

The Gompertz curve hazard can be multiplied by the RR to give a particular trajectory with that change in risk, and the mean can be obtained by integrating over a lifetime (more efficient than estimating by simulation using our `rgompertz`).
Doing two such integrations, one with a baseline RR of 1 and one with the new RR, then gives the two different life expectancies, and subtraction indicates the net gain/loss:

~~~{.R}
lifeExpectancy <- function(RR, age1, age2) { integrate(function(t){S(t, RR) / S(age1, RR)}, age1, age2)$value }
lifeExpectancyGain <- function(RR, startingAge=0, endingAge=Inf)
                        { lifeExpectancy(RR, startingAge, endingAge) -
                           lifeExpectancy(1, startingAge, endingAge) }

# visualize:
gainsVsRR <- data.frame(RR=seq(0.5,2,by=0.001), Gain=sapply(seq(0.5,2,by=0.001), lifeExpectancyGain))
plot(gainsVsRR, ylab="Gain (in years)")
~~~

![A graph of how many additional years a given change in RR causes.](/images/longevity/rr-vs-lifeexpectancygains.png)

If we plot a lot of samples of RR vs gain to get some intuition, it looks like a logarithmic curve, and indeed a linear model turns out to fit  extremely well (r^2^= 0.9999), certainly good enough for our purposes, so if we needed better performance we could replace two integrals by 4 arithmetic operations:

~~~{.R}
summary(lm(Gain ~ log(RR), data=gainsVsRR))
#         Min          1Q      Median          3Q         Max
# -0.00110357 -0.00095014 -0.00049523  0.00025105  0.39525452

lifeExpectancyGainLogApproximation <- function(RR) { 0.0009609580 + -9.3742723770*log(RR) }
lifeExpectancyGain(0.85)
# [1] 1.523915331
lifeExpectancyGainLogApproximation(0.85)
# [1] 1.52445767
~~~

Anyway, with this conversion of risk to years of gained life, we can see how much bang we get:

~~~{.R}
lifeExpectancyGain(0.90)
# [1] 0.9879195324
lifeExpectancyGain(0.85)
# 1.523913984
lifeExpectancyGain(0.85) - lifeExpectancyGain(0.85, startingAge=30)
# [1] 0.02529745239
(0.02529745239 /  1.523913984 ) * 100
# [1] 1.660031515
lifeExpectancyGain(0.85) - lifeExpectancyGain(0.85, startingAge=60)
# [1] 0.2763949673
~~~

The back-loading of mortality means that a constant reduction in mortality risk like an RR of 0.85 would not deliver the naive expectation of 12 years but far less: ~1.6 years.
On the plus side, this also means that if we wait to use an intervention until what might seem like 'late' in life (like age 30), we have not suffered an opportunity cost (of ~40%) like one might think, but much less (~1.7%).
The gains are minimal early on, and the opportunity cost only begins to really mount starting in one's 50s or 60s, which has the important implication that such interventions will benefit younger people much less (at least when it comes to interventions which offer only a constant reduction in risk and do not affect the acceleration of mortality caused by the aging process itself) and so the risks are more likely to make interventions profitable.

#### Maximum possible profit

More generally, it would be interesting to get an idea of what is the most profit possible for any particular reduction in ACM, by granting the most favorable possible assumptions: certainty that the RR is exact, that the intervention is side-effect-less and free both to start and continue, and it can begin at birth if need be.
For the plausible range of RRs, 0.5-1.0:

~~~{.R}
profitByAge <- function(t, RR=0.85, yearValue=50000, annualCost, startCost, probabilityPenalty=(1/3)) {  (lifeExpectancyGain(RR, startingAge=t) * yearValue * probabilityPenalty) -
                                        (annualCost*lifeExpectancy(RR,t,Inf) + startCost) }

rrs <- seq(0.5,1,by=0.025)
startAge <- 0
data.frame(RR=rrs,
           Years=sapply(rrs, function(r) { lifeExpectancyGain(r, startAge) }),
           Maximum.Profit=sapply(rrs, function(r){profitByAge(startAge, RR=r, annualCost=0, startCost=0, probabilityPenalty=1)}))

This provides upper bounds, and can help gauge plausibility of interventions for various variables - for example, if we were a 90-yo man considering embarking on caloric restriction, we might note that the upper bounds look like

~~~{.R}
# ...
# 13 0.800 2.0924464396   104622.32198
# 14 0.825 1.8038691126    90193.45563
# 15 0.850 1.5239153307    76195.76654
# 16 0.875 1.2520850389    62604.25194

# 21 1.000 0.0000000000        0.00000
~~~

Then we have to take into account the uncertainty that caloric restriction works at all in the extremely elderly (a halving is probably optimistic), the high probability its reduction in mortality will be relatively modest and in the 0.9s, the large financial & time costs of safely doing such a stringent diet (easily thousands of dollars in time and higher-quality food ingredients), the need to learn new recipes and count calories, the possible side-effects like increasing [frailty](!Wikipedia "Frailty syndrome") & [muscle loss](!Wikipedia "Sarcopenia")...
Given that the upper bound for plausible effect sizes is merely 1 year/\$50k, it strikes me as extremely unlikely that such a man could justify CR.

### Power analysis

How many subjects does it take to detect a specified RR? This is useful for planning clinical trials but also in interpreting them.
We can do simulation power analyses by using `rgompertz` to generate a number of subjects' death dates for different RRs (eg 0.85 vs 1.0), counting how many deaths in each group fall within a specified followup period of years, and running some sort of analysis based on that data.

~~~{.R}
gompertzSimulation <- function(RR, n1, n2, startingAge, followupYears) {
    experimental <- Filter(function(deathDate){deathDate>=startingAge}, rgompertz(n1, RR))
    control      <- Filter(function(deathDate){deathDate>=startingAge}, rgompertz(n2, 1))

    experimentalDeaths <- Filter(function(deathDate){deathDate<=(startingAge+followupYears)}, experimental)
         controlDeaths <- Filter(function(deathDate){deathDate<=(startingAge+followupYears)}, control)

    df <- data.frame(RR=RR,Start=startingAge, Followup=followupYears,
                     N1=length(experimental), N2=length(control),
                     N1.deaths=length(experimentalDeaths), N2.deaths=length(controlDeaths))
    return(cbind(df, data.frame(RR.observed=(df$N1.deaths/df$N1) /(df$N2.deaths/df$N2)))) }

gompertzPower <- function(RR, n1, n2, startingAge, followupYears, iters=100) {
    library(parallel)
    library(plyr)
    ldply(mclapply(1:iters, function(i) { gompertzSimulation(RR, n1, n2, startingAge, followupYears); }))
 }
~~~

# Metformin

[Metformin](!Wikipedia) is a standard drug prescribed to diabetics since the 1950s, known for helping control blood sugar while being cheap and safe; it has been used by scores of millions of people.
Alongside the blood sugar benefits, there appear to be other benefits relating to cancer and cardiovascular health, and possibly even all-cause mortality.
There is enough public interest that I heard of it, and as it passes the sniff test, I decided to look into it further.

Overall, metformin is promising and under my set of assumptions, profitable for people aged >=45yo to use.
This, however, entirely hinges on one's evaluation of the credibility of the correlational evidence and ability to tolerate the surprisingly common & unpleasant side-effects like diarrhea.

### Causality

Metformin not been much tested in healthy adult populations, although a good deal of media attention has been given to a trials being launched in 2016: "Targeting Aging with Metformin" (TAME; [profile of proponent Barzilai](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/09/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging "The man who wants to beat back aging: Nir Barzilai hopes to persuade FDA to bless the proposed anti-aging trial, which is unconventional in its goals and design."), [interview](http://healthspancampaign.org/2015/04/28/dr-nir-barzilai-on-the-tame-study/), [_Nature_ article](http://www.nature.com/news/anti-ageing-pill-pushed-as-bona-fide-drug-1.17769 "Anti-ageing pill pushed as bona fide drug: Regulators asked to consider ageing a treatable condition")^["Plans call for the trial to enrol 3,000 people aged 70–80 years at roughly 15 centres around the United States. The trial will take 5–7 years and cost US\$50 million, Barzilai estimates, although it does not yet have funding." There is also the Metformin in Longevity Study/MILES, but the [pre-registration](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02432287) indicates it will be aimed at gene expression changes and too short-term for mortality differences.]).
There are some meta-analyses of past clinical trials of diabetic patients, which include estimates for ACM.
Interpretation is difficult due to generally small numbers of deaths, differences in what metformin was being compared to, and the generally diseased subjects, but the picture looks mixed:

1. Saenz et al 2005, ["Metformin monotherapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002966.pub3/epdf/standard); withdrawn by the Cochrane Collaboration (apparently due to obsolescence)
2. Selvin et al 2008, ["Cardiovascular outcomes in trials of oral diabetes medications: a systematic review"](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414585)

    Metformin vs anything, RR=0.81.
3. Lamanna et al 2011, ["Effect of metformin on cardiovascular events and mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials"](/docs/2011-lamanna.pdf)

    RR=0.97 in active-comparator trials and 1.074 in placebo trials; overall, too underpowered to detect ACM of the plausible effect sizes but did find a trend towards larger reductions in longer trials.
4. Stevens et al 2012, ["Cancer outcomes and all-cause mortality in adults allocated to metformin: systematic review and collaborative meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials"](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ambady_Ramachandran/publication/232280792_Erratum_to_Cancer_outcomes_and_all-cause_mortality_in_adults_allocated_to_metformin_systematic_review_and_collaborative_meta-analysis_of_randomised_clinical_trials/links/0046351edfcba31994000000.pdf)

    ACM was split by comparison to placebo and comparison to another diabetic drug: 0.97 & 0.94.

Some of the biochemical & [animal experimental background](/docs/2011-bulterijs.pdf "'Metformin As a Geroprotector', Bulterijs 2011 [review]") suggesting benefits may be generalizability to healthy people, [with](http://impactaging.com/papers/v4/n5/full/100455.html "'Metformin in obesity, cancer and aging: addressing controversies', Berstein 2012") [proposals](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3906334/ "'Metformin: Do we finally have an anti-aging drug?', Anisimov 2013") that metformin is mimicking [caloric restriction](!Wikipedia) by subtly reducing efficiency of mitochondria, making the body think it is in a food-scarce state.
TAME seems to be prompted in part by Bannister et al 2014, ["Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without? A comparison of mortality in people initiated with metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy and matched, non-diabetic controls"](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guntram_Schernthaner/publication/266679685_Can_people_with_type_2_diabetes_live_longer_than_those_without_A_comparison_of_mortality_in_people_initiated_with_metformin_or_sulphonylurea_monotherapy_and_matched_nondiabetic_controls/links/53eb336a0cf28f342f451c33.pdf), a very large but nevertheless correlative result.
There also appears to not be much consistency in the correlation results, with competing meta-analyses on various permutations of comparisons.

So I will apply my proposed correlation!=causality correction of 33% to deflate the expected value.

## Benefit

We know metformin won't increase lifespans by 40% like some mice or make one live to 120, and probably also offers only a constant reduction in risk without decreasing the acceleration of risk, if for no other reason than hundreds of millions of people have taken metformin over the past century yet no gerontologist has ever noticed a massive overrepresentation of diabetics among centenarians.
The actual effect size estimates from the abstract of Bannister et al 2014 (emphasis added):

> We identified 78 241 subjects treated with metformin, 12 222 treated with sulphonylurea, and 90 463 matched subjects without diabetes. This resulted in a total, censored follow-up period of 503 384 years. There were 7498 deaths in total, representing unadjusted mortality rates of 14.4 and 15.2, and 50.9 and 28.7 deaths per 1000 person-years for metformin monotherapy and their matched controls, and sulphonylurea monotherapy and their matched controls, respectively. With reference to observed survival in diabetic patients initiated with metformin monotherapy [survival time ratio (STR) = 1.0], adjusted median survival time was 15% lower (STR = *0.85*, 95% CI 0.81–0.90) in matched individuals without diabetes and 38% lower (0.62, 0.58–0.66) in diabetic patients treated with sulphonylurea monotherapy.

STR isn't quite an RR but it's similar:

> The log-logistic model resulted in the best fit in terms of AIC, and the adequacy of this distribution was further assessed by plotting appropriately transformed non-parametric estimates against time. The log-logistic survival model provides beta coefficients that equal the difference in log survival time between groups or for continuous predictors. Exponentiation of the beta coefficient gives the ratio between median survival times, known as the survival time ratio (STR), or acceleration factor. STRs less than 1 represent a decrease in survival time; values greater than 1 represent prolonged survival.
>
> ...In total, there were 7498 deaths, corresponding to an unadjusted event rate of 18.1 deaths per 1000 person-years. Unadjusted event rates were highest in the sulphonylurea group and lowest in the metformin group (50.9 vs. 14.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively; _p_ < 0.001; Table 2). Unadjusted event rates were higher in sulphonylurea-treated patients than in their matched, non-diabetic controls (50.9 vs. 28.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively; _p_ < 0.001) but, surprisingly, were lower in those treated with metformin than in their matched controls (14.4 vs. 15.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively; _p_ = 0.054). Unadjusted event rates were lowest in people aged <60 years at index date and highest for people aged >70 years for both diabetic and control subjects.

So I think if we wanted to convert to something else, STR has already done the denominator for us and we just divide $\frac{14.2}{15.2}$ to get the raw RR of 0.93, which is not as good as the quoted STR of 0.85 (0.81–0.90), indicating that the covariates do differ a bit systematically? Looking at table 1, the metformin group seems to have been previously treated for many more disorders, explaining why the models think metformin is so good (because the metformin users *should* be dying off faster yet have a similar death rate as the healthy controls)
Table 2 gives overall figures for all-cause mortality: _n_=78241, 2663 deaths in metformin ($\frac{2663}{78241}=0.03403586355$); _n_=78241, 2669 deaths in their controls ($\frac{2669}{78241}$=0.03411254969) ($\frac{0.03403586355}{0.03411254969}$=0.9977519669).
Pooling in the sulphonylurea controls as well: _n_=748 deaths plus the 2669 other controls, total controls _n_=90463, total deaths 3417 ($\frac{3417}{90463}$=0.03777234892) ($\frac{0.03403586355}{0.03777234892}$=0.9010788188). So that verifies the RR of 0.93 since the difference between 0.90 and 0.93 is probably due to the differences in total followup years.

An RR of 0.85/0.90 gets us around a year, which converting to dollars:

~~~{.R}
yearValue <- 50000
lifeExpectancyGain(0.90) * yearValue
# [1] 49396.02263
lifeExpectancyGain(0.85) * yearValue
# [1] 76195.76654
~~~

Or \$50k-\$76k.

## Cost
### Financial

Metformin is said to be very cheap. How cheap is cheap?

Bannister et al 2014 doesn't give dosages or look for a dose-response curve but since it's drawing on clinical records, the diabetics must be using conventional dosages.
[Drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/dosage/metformin.html) gives a maintenance dose of 2000mg/daily; the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metformin-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20067074) says not usually more than 2000-2500mg/daily; the anti-aging quacks tend to suggest ~1000mg/daily for non-diabetics; the MILES protocol calls for 1700mg/daily.
I'll use 2000mg/daily here, which is 4x500mg doses.

[GoodRx](http://www.goodrx.com/metformin) says that a number of large American chains, including Walmart & Target & Sam's Club, will sell 60x500mg for \$4.
It's unclear if this includes sales tax, so I will tack on an additional 5% for that.
This is 15 days' worth at 2000mg/daily, so a month's supply is \$8.4, and an annual supply is \$102.
For the time/effort of regular consumption, I'll estimate it at half a minute a day and \$8/hr. (Metformin has [a shelf-life of 5 years](http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/23244/SPC) so at least in theory one could buy large batches and then the shopping time is trivial.)
If we start at age 30, then without any discounting, we can expect to pay for metformin for a number of years (increased, of course, by our metformin usage):

~~~{.R}
unitDoses <- (60*500) / 2000
unitCost <- 4 * 1.05
annualPurchases <- 365.25 / unitDoses
moneyCost <- unitCost * annualPurchases
timeCost <- (0.5/60) * 8 * 365.25
metforminAnnualCost <- moneyCost + timeCost
metforminTotalCost <- metforminAnnualCost * lifeExpectancy(0.85, 30, Inf)
metforminTotalCost
# [1] 6164.222177
~~~

<\$6k is around an order of magnitude smaller than the more conservative RR estimate, giving a gain of \$69k for 0.85.

### Side-effects

The direct monetary cost of metformin is so minimal that it's almost certainly outweighed by the inconvenience of purchasing & regularly using it, and by any side-effects one might experience.
[Side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin#Adverse_effects) are a more serious concern: while considered safe and a net gain from the point of view of all-cause mortality, that just means the side-effects are *relatively* rare or nonfatal but metformin might still be unpleasant enough, or produce long-lasting reductions in quality of life which negate much of the gain.
(It would not be much of an improvement to halve one's risk if, in exchange, one becomes a quadriplegic.)

[Drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/sfx/metformin-side-effects.html) provides some percentage breakdowns after noting that many problems can be avoided by gradual increases in dosage or go away spontaneously

Most of these seem to be relatively minor or temporary, and the GI problems can be reduced by splitting up doses & taking with food; if they persist, a prophylactic user could simply discontinue metformin.
(The [FDA prescribing information](http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/02/May02/053102/800471e6.pdf "Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets") notes in one trial, 6% of the metformin subjects had to stop because the diarrhea was so bad. Net attrition/dropout rates in metformin studies vary so much that they're not helpful and not all of it will have to do with metformin reducing the daily quality of life through side-effects, but overall they look like 10-40% would be a reasonable guess.)
Discontinuation would be too bad since then one doesn't gain the benefits, but one won't have lost too much besides perhaps a few weeks of severe diarrhea and a month or two of wasted metformin pills, so it's not *too* bad.
You might think we would have to incorporate a penalty of 10-40% to the expected value - if there's a 10-40% chance the metformin is useless, shouldn't we multiply the mortality benefit by 0.1-0.4? - but that's only if we have no way of knowing the metformin is useless and we are considering the scenario in which we take it for the rest of our life even while it's useless. In this case, because we know quickly if we can handle metformin or not, we only need to consider the upfront cost of the month of diarrhea.
(So more formally: the expected value is lower, but the Value of Information is higher because once one starts metformin and the GI problems either turn out to not be so bad or to go away, the expected value then increases substantially now that one knows one can take metformin without problem.)

The main side-effect mentioned as potentially fatal is [lactic acidosis](!Wikipedia) - for example, of the [12 New Zealand cases 1977-1998, 8 were fatal](http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUarticles/5.htm "Metformin and Fatal Lactic Acidosis") & the FDA prescribing information estimates 50%, which does not sound fun.
On the other hand, lactic acidosis seems to be an acute disorder whose primary effect would be killing you, so it should already be taken care of by working with a reduction in all-cause mortality (that is, even if you are more likely to die by lactic acidosis, the metformin must be sparing you even more gruesome deaths and on average it's still helpful).
And the lactic acidosis rates (2-9 per 100,000 person-years, so at 50 years of usage as prophylactic, a risk of $\frac{9}{100000} \cdot 50 \cdot \frac{8}{12}$=0.003) may simply reflect the pre-existing morbidity of diabetics and not caused by metformin, and so not a concern at all.

So for side-effects, I think we can sum it up as a month or two of diarrhea, which is unpleasant but not that big a deal. I wouldn't pay more than \$50/day or so to get rid of some diarrhea, which over two months is \$3000, but that's somewhat unlikely.

## Cost-benefit

Bringing it all together for a 30yo considering metformin:

~~~{.R}
benefit <- lifeExpectancyGain(0.85, startingAge=30) * yearValue * (1/3)
cost <- metforminTotalCost + 3000
benefit - cost
# [1] 15812.74246
~~~

So metformin use is probably profitable for our 30yo.

### Optimal age

What about other ages? In fact, is there an optimal age at which to start, or should we be feeding little kids metformin too?
Rewriting to generalize it, we can compute the profit for if we started at all ages:

~~~{.R}
ages <- sapply(1:120, function(startingAge) { profitByAge(startingAge, RR=0.85, metforminAnnualCost, 3000, (1/3))}); ages

Apparently there *is* an optimal age - and it's not 30yo but 45yo (metformin is profitable enough that starting too early, rather than never, is still a good idea).
So quite aside from waiting for better information like the MILES results, our hypothetical 30yo still should wait a long time before starting to use metformin.
Also unsurprising is that ~90yo, mortality rates become so high that the metformin reduction yields such a small absolute gain of time that it can no longer offset the fixed absolute cost of metformin.

While \$18k may not sound like that much on an individual level, it's substantial (<\$1.42t over all people currently 55+) on a societal scale:

~~~{.R}
## multiply maximal benefit by the total number of
## Americans >=55yo according to http://www.indexmundi.com/united_states/age_structure.html :
ages[which.max(ages)] * (19309019+20720284+20304644+25874360)
# [1] 1426091932050
~~~

## Sensitivity

We can also use the formula to ask how small (close to 1) the RR must be before, given the specified purchase & side-effect costs, there is no longer any age at which metformin is profitable:

~~~{.R}
rrs <- seq(0.85,1,by=0.01)
data.frame(RR=rrs,
 Maximum.Profit=sapply(rrs, function(r){max(sapply(1:120, function(t){profitByAge(t,RR=r)}))}))
#      RR Maximum.Profit
# 1  0.85  16542.3957583
# 2  0.86  14832.4764343
# 3  0.87  13151.9204186
# 4  0.88  11501.5626452
# 5  0.89   9883.2197752
# 6  0.90   8295.4160347
# 7  0.91   6744.2697401
# 8  0.92   5230.8482349
# 9  0.93   3762.0437695
# 10 0.94   2344.8834221
# 11 0.95    989.5406473
# 12 0.96   -283.0060740
# 13 0.97  -1437.7229939
# 14 0.98  -2399.0603044
# 15 0.99  -2970.9252342
# 16 1.00  -3021.2570816
~~~

The boundary is around 0.95.
So if one doesn't believe the true causal ACM RR is <=0.96, then it doesn't look like metformin is ever worthwhile.

## TAME power analysis

Using the previously defined `gompertzPower` function, we can ask a question like:
assuming a clinical trial is investigating a claimed RR of 0.85, plans to enrol 3000 people aged 70yo, so presumably 1500 in each arm, and will followup for 5 years (a trial which bears a certain resemblance to plans for TAME); how often would the observed RR<1.0?

~~~{.R}
df0.85 <- gompertzPower(0.85, 1000, 1000, 50, 10, 100)
table(df0.85$RR.observed<1.0)
# FALSE  TRUE
#   22    78
~~~

Let's consider something more plausible like the baby aspirin or some metformin estimates, an RR of 0.94:

~~~{.R}
df0.94 <- gompertzPower(0.94, 1500, 1500, 70, 5, 1000)
table(df0.94$RR.observed<1.0)
# FALSE  TRUE

76% power is likewise still acceptable. But just because a clinical trials *plans* to enrol _n_=3000 doesn't mean they will succeed, as there is always attrition, and attrition can be severe depending on how unpleasant the side-effects are; for metformin, for example, the attrition could easily be 30%:

~~~{.R}
df0.94attrit <- gompertzPower(0.94, 1500*0.70, 1500*0.70, 70, 5, 1000)
table(df0.94attrit$RR.observed<1.0)
# FALSE  TRUE
#   254   746
~~~

Knocking us back to 74%. So under more realistic assumptions about attrition and effect sizes, there's a good chance that there would not be a correct signed result.
Finally, we could consider the probability that we would get both a RR in the desired direction and the difference would be large enough to be statistically-significant at _p_<0.05 when treated as a two-proportion problem:

~~~{.R}
df <- df0.94attrit
pvalues <- sapply(1:nrow(df),
            function(i) { prop.test(c(df[i,]$N1.deaths, df[i,]$N2.deaths), c(df[i,]$N1, df[i,]$N2), alternative="less")$p.value })
table(pvalues<=0.05)
#
# FALSE  TRUE
#  890   110
~~~

So it is highly unlikely (~10%) we could expect the realistic trial to deliver a statistically-significant reduction in mortality.
(This lack of power for statistical-significance on ACM may be why the TAME investigators talk primarily about looking for reductions in cancer/heart attacks/strokes: as more common events than death, reductions will show up more clearly there, as they do in past metformin trials.)
We don't necessarily care about statistical-significance, since this is a decision-analysis approach: our question is whether the gained data shifts the posterior probability enough to change the optimal decision.
But it's good to have an idea of power in that sense to make it easier to interpret the research article & media reports (eg the trial might be a 'failure' from the point of view of statistical-significance, even as it increases the profitability of using metformin).

    > We identified 18 independent randomized controlled trials, including 57 311 participants. A total of 4777 deaths from any cause occurred during a trial size–adjusted mean of 5.7 years. Daily doses of vitamin D supplements varied from 300 to 2000 IU. The trial size–adjusted mean daily vitamin D dose was 528 IU. In 9 trials, there was a 1.4- to 5.2-fold difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D between the intervention and control groups. The summary relative risk for mortality from any cause was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.99).

    > The IPD analysis yielded data on 70,528 randomized participants (86.8% females) with a median age of 70 (interquartile range, 62–77) yr. Vitamin D with or without calcium reduced mortality by 7% [hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88–0.99]. However, vitamin D alone did not affect mortality, but risk of death was reduced if vitamin D was given with calcium (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98). The number needed to treat with vitamin D plus calcium for 3 yr to prevent one death was 151. Trial level meta-analysis (24 trials with 88,097 participants) showed similar results, i.e. mortality was reduced with vitamin D plus calcium (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–0.99), but not with vitamin D alone (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.06).

    > Vitamin D therapy significantly decreased all-cause mortality with a duration of follow-up longer than 3 years with a RR (95% CI) of 0.94 (0.90–0.98). No benefit was seen in a shorter follow-up periods with a RR (95% CI) of 1.04 (0.97–1.12)

    Zheng does not report the pooled RR of all studies. Pooled experimental arm death rate: (1175+3693)/(8809+33752)=0.1143770118, control death rate (1118+3880)/(9193+33712)=0.1164899196, RR=0.981 p=0.33 (`prop.test(c((1175+3693), (1118+3880)), c((8809+33752), (9193+33712)))`)

   > Vitamin D decreased all-cause mortality (1854/24,846 (7.5%) versus 2007/25,020 (8.0%); RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98); P = 0.009; I² = 0%; 15 trials; 49,866 participants; moderate quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors.

> For the re-analysis conducted in the original report, they excluded 5 of 18 trials in the Autier 2007 meta-analysis: One trial was on patients with congestive heart failure,206 one was published only in abstract form,207 in one trial the controls also received supplementation with vitamin D, albeit with a smaller dose,208 and two trials used vitamin D injections.209,210 One additional eligible RCT (Lyons 2007)185 was identified and included in our meta-analysis....Three RCTs from the previous systematic review [based on Autier et al 2007?] and an additional C rated RCT were included in our reanalysis. Three used daily doses that ranged between 400 and 880 IU, and one used 100,000 IU every 3 months. Our meta-analysis of the 4 RCTs (13,833 participants) shows absence of significant effects of vitamin D supplementation on all-cause mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.02; random effects model). There is little evidence for between-study heterogeneity in these analyses.
