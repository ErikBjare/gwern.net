# ICON 31 / 2012
## Thursday, 29 March

I did not expect ICON 2012 to be better than [ICON 2011]() or [ICON 2010]() for me; my car caught on fire and burnt to a crisp 2 weeks before the convention (I do not know why, nor does my little sister who was driving at the time) which substantially complicates transportation & limits times, and none of the guests were connected to my own interests as opposed to last year where there was [Tiffany Grant](!Wikipedia).

Regardless, I showed up as usual on Thursday at 5 PM sharp (sans sister, who had returned to college upstate and was missing ICON). I was immediately struck by how much of the work had already been done: tables spread out in piles and some chairs as well. I signed in, grabbed gloves, and got to work.

We were already in the table setup stage, so we did that relatively quickly while I took stock. Many of the staffers were the same - Liz was doing registration as usual, the big fat guy with the mohawk was running construction, the paunchy bald guy popped in from time to time, although not Bill etc. (One thing I was struck by: the use of tablets as well as laptops. I know the iPad is insanely popular and all, but deep down I believe they are toys.) There were also some of the same volunteers as before, like the tall guy Kevin (who for some reason I thought was gay, perhaps due to his glasses and _My Little Pony_ t-shirt, but I may or may not have been told the next day by an Asian Dr. Who cosplayer that I was mistaken about that) and a few of his associates. But mostly new faces. Not many new faces, though: while there was less work, I had the feeling that there were less people as well.

As we unfolded tables, the feeling grew stronger: there were less *tables* as well. There was more space between the aisles, and arranging them was easier. (When we got to the adjustment phase after dinner, it was fairly easy and not insanity-inducing. Why? I assume the margins were more generous this year...)

When the table-folding died down and I got tired of standing around waiting for tables to need moving a few inches, I switched to the cloth stalls. The blue cloth stalls? Also fewer in number, with actual leftover poles & drapes. I was sure there were more last year, bigger clusters. What happened? From the economics I know, 2011 was a worse year than 2012, so one would expect more dealers or at least the same number, and not fewer. When I brought it up, no one mentioned any increase in dealer fees and it's hard to imagine that the elasticity of dealer demand is such that the nonprofit did better by leaving slots in the gym wasted.

(Random thoughts during the night: sliding the drapes onto the poles was best done like the drape was a condom. The shadows cast from the smallest structure by the many gym lights formed a reversed swastika. What on earth is all the construction Stony Brook is doing in between the sports complex and the Student Union and how much is being paid for on the backs of the undergraduates?)

Dinner came at a pleasing time; the subways were OK, but the chocolate cookies were better than your usual catering and I enjoyed the pasta salad. Continuing the disturbing feeling of smallness, there were plenty of leftovers and I stuffed myself with 3 plates or so. (Well, it would go to waste if no one ate it...)

The post-prandial activities were much the same as before, although we soon switched to hauling chairs around and moving tables into the draped booths. At 8 PM, we were told to clear out. A giant line formed to check out (I took the opportunity to eat some more, since the line was going nowhere fast). I asked when to come back, and was told 10 AM the next morning. Well. I'd try.

Vital stats:

- number of steps recorded by [pedometer](!Wikipedia): 10,981 (average: <6,000)

    I only recently began wearing a pedometer; I wasn't surprised that I had doubled my daily average working since my feet were a little sore the next morning, but I was dismayed that it was only 11,000 steps - since 10,000 is the [recommended amount](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/walking/2012/04/why_don_t_americans_walk_more_the_crisis_of_pedestrianism_.single.html "The Crisis in American Walking: How we got off the pedestrian path") and the healthy [Amish clock in](http://www.huffinesinstitute.org/Portals/37/Bassett_MSSE_36_04.pdf "'Physical Activity in an Old Order Amish Community', Bassett et al 2004") with averages like *18,000* steps. Clearly I have a ways to go.
- [sleep score](Zeo) that night: 92 (average: ~94)
- mood (1-5): 3.5 (average: 3)

## Friday, 30 March

As expected, my ride wasn't doable until noon. After the usual long wait at the crowded volunteer desk in the SAC, I learned there was no work and I should come back ~3-4 PM. Well, fine. I could kill time in the library, or better yet, the SF Forum! I didn't know if they were open, but if I was wrong, it was a short walk to the library.
