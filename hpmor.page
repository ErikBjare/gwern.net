blood/Atlantis/origin of magic basically wrong http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5543

someone will be mentioned or shown using the Imperius curse on themselves (or consenting to another's use on them) to supplement their willpower (dieting, working hard, etc.)

Humans can be permanently turned into house-elves
    and this will be revealed in chapter 80 http://predictionbook.com/predictions/6109

### Objects

The 5 Voldemort Horcruxes are where Harry suggested putting hidden things in ch46

There are >7 Voldemort Horcruxes

Philosopher's Stone...
    requires human sacrifice http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5420
    to be mass-manufactured by Harry or at his behest

A Deathly Hallow besides the Cloak will appear in the possession of a character in the present-day at some point.
    the Master Wand is already in the possession of a character
        and it is Dumbledore
        and it is Quirrel

The diary is
    Voldemort's diary
    both Voldemort and Roger Bacon's diary
    a Horcrux
        made by Quirrel
            when he killed Rita Skeeter
    a diary with indefinite owners but no intrinsic magical properties http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5610

Azkaban Island is the last remnant of Atlantis

The purpose of the golden wibblers device in Dumbledore's office will be revealed before 2017 http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5802

### Creatures

Dementors
    either copy minds or store souls for later resurrection

There will be at least one character whose Animagus form is another human

## Events

Peverell tombstone alluded to http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5122

### Past

Quirrel was Voldemort's master or teacher, a power behind the throne

Lily Potter did not give Petunia a magic potion, but actually Imperius'ed her.

Lucius Malfoy was, at least initially, Imperiused into becoming a Death Eater

#### Prophecy & Attack

Voldemort did not intend Harry's death http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3237
    Voldemort voluntarily retired from Dark Lord, doing something else involving Harry

The Prophecy referred to Neville Longbottom and not Harry

Dumbledore deliberately arranged for Voldemort to learn of the Prophecy http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5550

The Prophecy was faked

#### Rita Skeeter hoaxing

Who did it?
    Quirrel
    Dumbledore
    Fred & George...
        and they used Polyjuice Potion to submit the hoax article under Rita Skeeter's name
        and they gave false memories via Pensieve to Rita Skeeter
        and they tricked her into writing down the story and then Obliviated her; she trusted her notes and published
        and they used Muggle technology to forge the documents
        and they magically modified the memory of the witnesses Rita relied on to write the article

### Future

A ritual will restore Voldemort to a body
    and Bellatrix Black will be used

Harry will stay at Hogwarts during Easter and his parents will visit him

## Characters

Dumbledore, Quirrel, Voldemort, Santa Claus, and Mr. Hat and Cloak are all the same person.

### Harry

Harry is...
    Voldemort http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5073
        a backup copy of Voldemort which either has developed differently or not awoken
    a Horcrux

Harry's disturbed sleep is a clue to some unrevealed secret (and not just a time-turner excuse)

Harry will invent some form of 'metamagic' (eg. a self-replicating spell or magical construct/artifact)
    Harry will create a superintelligent AI using magic or magical objects
        and it won't be Friendly, killing many/all

Harry will learn Latin
    and will translate a nontrivial portion of the diary

Harry will bite a teacher
    who bite him first
        and is Quirrel

Harry will become an Animagus who turns into
    a creature which doesn't age (eg. a basilisk)
    a phoenix
    a human

Harry will steal the Philosopher's Stone at some point

conditional on humans being transformable into house elves, will be so transformed
    before chapter 85 http://predictionbook.com/predictions/6110

     die fighting Voldemort
        by ch100 http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5016
     have Hermione killed with Harry as a witness

is...
    Voldemort
        a younger version of Voldemort, a damaged backup from many years before (like the diary Riddle)
    the fused personality of Voldemort + original Quirrel
    original Quirrel possessed by Voldemort (a la _Philosopher's Stone_)
    a Horcrux as well as anything else
    a basilisk http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5419
    Harry (future)

and plans to...
    manipulate Harry (already a Horcrux) into making a Harry-Horcrux of Quirrel so neither can ever die
    satisfy Draco & Hermione's wishes by
        making Slytherin & Ravenclaw tie for House Cup
        getting Draco and Hermione into the same House, which wins

knows...
    that Harry's stone is the Resurrection Stone (and it is)

zombie-mode is
    about spending time at the Pioneer probe perspective

killed his parents

### Dumbledore

The rock he gave Harry is or contains a real:
    Philosopher's Stone
    ordinary rock
    James Potter

Intended to estrange Lily and Severus by writing those notes in her potions textbook

### Voldemort

All his horcruxes except the Pioneer probe will be destroyed, and Voldemort is doomed to wander the cosmos forever
    and this outcome will be either planned or permitted by Harry

Harry is a Horcrux and Voldemort knows this

is Quirrel's wand or is contained within it

Learned how to make Horcruxes from a book despite the Interdict of Merlin

    by someone other than Dumbledore
        but Dumbledore did claim he did it http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5418

            and he fooled Lucius into thinking Dumbledore claimed it (possibly to gain his loyalty)
        by her own hand
            accidentally, eg. by Fiendfyre (analogous to Goyle)
        by Amelia Bones
    by Dumbledore http://predictionbook.com/predictions/5417 and he killed her...
        by accident
        because she was a Voldemort Horcrux
        to send a message to the Death Eaters to stop attacking Order relatives

### "Cloak & Hat"

    Sirius Black http://predictionbook.com/predictions/3236
