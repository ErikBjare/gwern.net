<h2><center>About Your Personality Report</center></h2>
<p align='left'>Your responses to the previous questions have been used to generate the report below.  The results are grouped here into five categories: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness.  These categories represent the way that most people talk about personality and may therefore reflect cultural or social biases.</p>
<p align='left'>While many or all of these categories may look like words you typically use (even ones that often are accompanied with
a value judgment) it is important to understand that these five factors are really labels used by psychologists
to describe differences between people.</p>

<p align='left'>This is not psycho-analysis; the results presented here were created directly from your responses to the items.  For that
reason, it is unlikely that there should be a mis-match between our descriptions and how you or others view themselves.
<p align='left'>The descriptions used here are borrowed from <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/" target="_blank">John Johnson</a>, who hosts a <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIPNEOdescriptions.html" target="_blank"> page of descriptions </a>.

Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and often experience positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals who are likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.</p>

<p>Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and disengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression; the introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers to be alone. The independence and reserve of the introvert is sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.</p></p><p text-align: left><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests for the sake of others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.</p>


<p>Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.</p>


<p>Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.</p></p><p text-align: left><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

People see you as tough, critical, and uncompromising.</p><hr><h3 align="center">Conscientiousness Report</h3><p text-align: left><p>Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad; occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful, fun-to-be-with, and zany.</p>


<p>Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts not only harm other members of society, but also can result in retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job, hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually destroy one's health.</p>


<p>Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively does not allow for the consideration of alternative courses of action, some of which may be wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.</p>


<p>A hallmark of intelligence -- an attribute that is often considered to separate humans from earlier life forms -- is the ability to evaluate likely consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of counter-productive impulses. The idea that intelligence involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means both wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.</p>


<p>The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics. Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded as stuffy and boring. Unconscientious people may be criticized for their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and they will never be called stuffy.</p></p><p text-align: left><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

People regard you as reliable and hard-working.</p><hr><h3 align="center">Emotional Stability Report</h3><p text-align: left><p>Emotional stability is the opposite of emotional reactivity, which is the tendency for one's emotional state to be highly responsive to both negative and positive situational cues. People low in emotional stability are emotionally reactive. They respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more intense and consuming than normal. Low scorers are generally more sensitive, emotional and prone to feelings that are upsetting, such as anxiety or guilt.  Their pattern of experience can be described as an 'emotional rollercoaster'.  They often experience swiftly fluctuating emotions and are easily perturbed from a neutral state toward emotional extremes, such as elation and excitement or anger and agitation.  These problems in emotional regulation can diminish one's ability to think clearly, make rational decisions, and cope effectively with stress.</p>


<p>At the other end of the scale, individuals who score high in emotional stability are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that high scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; frequency of positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain.</p></p><p text-align: left><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>

Open people are intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. Compared to closed people, they tend to be more aware of their feelings. They tend to think and act in individualistic and non-conforming ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience; consequently, this factor has also been called Culture or Intellect. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of Openness to Experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.</p>


<p>Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or performing arts. People with low scores on Openness to Experience tend to have narrow, common interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change.</p>


<p>Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who are often themselves Open to Experience. However, open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and a number of service occupations.</p></p><p text-align: left><center><b>Score at a Glance</b></center>
