I am an outspoken proponent of modafinil and would miss it if it were unavailable. I do find it weaker than Adderall on balance, but far safer for long-term use and with far less health concerns. "

"22" "Modafinil has been a godsend in my life. I am currently seeking diagnosis for Narcolepsy (without cataplexy), have been diagnosed with ADD, and have experienced much depression in my life; which in my opinion is related to the ADD and Narcolepsy.
I still take Adderall everyother day for my ailments opposite of my Modafinil. Though I find the Adderall less effective (despite it's 'punch'), my country only prescribes Modafinil for Narcolepsy (which I have only recently come to realize I most likely have), so it's still too expensive as an everyday medication for me. Positively, I am less worried about becoming addicted to Adderall along with a skyrocketing tolerance.

It is because of all this, I would like to thank you in your efforts in illuminating the experiences of Modafinil users, and what I can only assume as being their success with such.

Have a lovely day!"

"49" "I have two friends who always get GI-issues like my own (squirts) from modafinil at even just 100mg. I only get them with frequent usage.  Neither of them have any issues from armodafinil.

Once-weekly usage results in no long-term tolerance, once every 3-4 days builds up tolerance over a few months, in my experience.

I have also used DMT, metacetin, 5-meo-mipt, psilacetin, Semax... and most importantly PRL-8-53 and IDRA-21.

PRL-8-53 seems to massively potentiate modafinil and I never combine the two because it's incredibly stimulating for 5-6 hours and then I crash really, really hard. Hard enough that the first time I combined the two I was super stimmed out, then started to crash and left work early... by the time I made it home (8 minutes later) I was able to just open the door and fall on the floor.  It was really agonizing.  I later tested this by dosing 3mg PRL-8-53 with 25mg modafinil and that actually worked okay, but again I crashed too hard to be useful.

IDRA-21 doesn't really do anything for me when combined with modafinil, great by itself but just seems to make me more tired than usual ~36-hours later."

Modafinil does not have the \"tweaky\" side effects with paranoia, sweating, racing heartrate etc. But it gives focus, alertness, and for me, mood elevation for the entire day.

It does indeed impact sleep, so I don't even split up my dose, typically. Take it all as soon as you wake up, or it will substantially impact sleep (only useful on the uncommon nights that I go to a live music show.)"

I always get 8 Hours a Night in Bed, however I do not get the Required REM Sleep that people without Narcolepsy get each Night.

I awake after 8 hours and still Am Yawning and cannot get alert until I take modafinil, then is 10-15 minutes I feel the energy to get up and start my Day. I take one 200 MG Modafinil in The Morning and then another 200MG Pill around 1pm Early Afternoon. This Schedule has helped me the past 5 years be able to stay alert enough to live a Semi Normal Life. I still cannot Drive Long Distances as The Danger of Falling Asleep at the Wheel prevents that. I have experienced over 8 Auto Accidents since my Teens, falling asleep at the Wheel due to Excessive Daytime Sleepiness. 5 of the 8 Accidents totaled the Vehicle and the other 3 caused severe Damage to the Car. The Fact that I was \"Asleep\" may have spared me as I have survived all auto Accidents.

Modafinil is a Blessing for those of us with Narcolepsy and EDS, it is unfortunate the Big Pharmaceutical Companies in the United States have made the Drug Out of Reach \"Money Wise\" for the average Person without Medical Insurance. Last Time I tried to Private Pay Provigil it was $20 Each Pill at a Name Brand Pharmacy here in United States. The Online Pharmacies Worldwide have leveled the Playing Field and I can Now Purchase Modofinil for approx. $1.25 each 200mg Tablet! Thank You online Pharmacies \"Such as ModafinilCat\" for this much Needed Source for patients like myself. I applaud the Hard work and Dedication you put forth in providing this medication to those of us in need.

All the Best,

"403" "I find modafinil much more powerful and noticeable than armodafinil.

Armodafinil is much more subtle but seems to keep me awake much longer than modafinil. I only rarely use it now as I don't feel the desired 'smart drug' effects.(disappointed really after it was promoted as more powerful, everyone else I gave it to reacted similarly.)

Half a pill of modafinil gets me going.

Half a pill of armodafinil does nothing.

I've experimented with different ways and times of using the drug. If you pull an all-nighter you can take a modafinil right before you inevitably crash and will wake up refreshed in a fraction of the time.

Taking with turmeric(combined with coconut oil as it is fat soluble) relieved headaches and possibly enhances the cognitive effects.

Other anti-inflammatory supplements may work.

I'm doing more experiments. Let me know if you have specific interests you'd like tested."

"462" "Modafinil - As someone who has been called 'gifted', or at the very least have realized that my cognitive abilities are already acceptable and my comprehension and pattern recognition levels are higher than average - my reason behind taking modafinil (modalert) was to stay awake during my overnight shift.

I don't feel 'smarter' when I take it -- I do feel as though my mind becomes 'yoked'. It looks for tasks to complete, and I feel satisfaction in completing them. There's a level of 'leaning' towards intellectual thought rather than emotional thought that happens, though, and I think that's probably why people think it makes them 'smarter'. This comes with a downside - You lose some of your creativity in problem-solving. Answers come quickly enough, but I seem to lose the affinity for alternate solutions.

But, surprisingly, I found two effects that aren't much referred to. If someone takes normal amphetamine type wake aids, there's a measure of 'time compression' that happens. You look up and time seems to have melted as you work, you don't seem to feel the passage of time. On modafinil, there's no time loss.

Second, it reduced my dysthymic tendencies without the usual side effects -  I felt depressive episodes weren't able to get their usual foothold.

Anyway, that's just an opinion of a person using the drug. It's not a scientific study. "

One day I'll be productive, energetic, and talkative, and the next day I'll be lethargic and activities as simple as stringing together intelligible sentences proves to be beyond my grasp.

Over the past year or so I've been trying different daily doses anywhere in the 50-600mg range and experimenting with different brands (Sun, Intas, and HAB).

I've found that I get the most consistent results at 100mg/day using Sun Pharma modafinil. Intas seems very inconsistent and I've only had a week or two of experience with HAB so I can't speak for them. It is sometimes necessary to scale up to 200mg towards the end of the week but if I take breaks on weekends it seems to lower my tolerance enough that 100 is effective again.

That being said, it is hard for me to stay at 100mg despite ever-increasing tolerance and decreasing effectiveness. Currently I think my average daily dose is 200mg and I've recently brought armodafinil into the mix. Considering armodafinil only from now on, as I've been fairly pleased with the results."

Many people have different circumstances which give them unfair playing grounds when studying; some have to work full time, some have mental illness, some have attention issues. Some were born with better genetics to be smarter then one another, is that unfair?

Armodafinil has allowed me to live a normal life despite various health and financial setbacks and does so without the deleterious effects attendant to traditional stimulant use: there have been no increases in heart rate or blood pressure seen in results of regular bloodwork and,  unlike Adderall and Ritalin, this drug does not inhibit creativity - whatever creativity means. The drug was extremely tolerable and the higher  doses are disincentivized by diminishing returns from a tolerance rapidly built up. However, I am inclined to think permanent changes to my cognitive functioning are occurring. The abuse potential is minimal but not zero. I submit that we'd do well to consider it a greater risk to not increase awareness of its safety and potential as a world-changing and life-altering drug not only for otherwise healthy populations, but due to its invaluability as a treatment for its existing indications.

On and off brand was unnoticeable difference. I have recently tried Armodafinil and they are a significant improvement, in both duration and intensity.

We used to be prescribed Amphetamines (tabulated speed for all intents and purposes). Significantly more intense, shorter duration, and the need to 'be' distracted was much higher than with an afinil."

Being inherently anxious about participating in social events, my brain was often clouded by negative thoughts ranging from how others responded to how reserved or inadequate I felt when talking to someone.  After taking modafinil, I noticed a huge difference in my cognitive abilities to perform actions and focus on my thoughts, that I no longer feel obsessed about how others view me.  I'm now able to fill that portion of what I thought was lacking in my life, and I owe that to the use of modafinil.  Thank you."

They took care of me and noticed that 200mg was probably the cause of it, and lowered my dose. I have struggled for years of trying to learn to program but could never seem to comprehend what was going on overall in a project. After taking modafinil around the second time, I somewhat acquired 'abstract thinking' and helped me how to approach coding programs.

One last thing, is modafinil really made me realize many things. One of the most drastic was how I noticed I havn't been that focused since I was younger. I started looking into different nootropics but ended up on the whole side of the spectrum what may be causing my overall loss of focus. Pornography.

I have now been on the nofap challenge and it seems like it has been the root cause of all of these years of loss of focus. Modafinil really brought back the memories of before.

Once I tried adderall in college though, I suddenly realized how different my life could have gone before that had I been given the correct treatment. Finally at 27 I realized it was really effecting my work. So, I found a doctor, but after having three separate doctors send me to \"specialists\" for more testing, I gave up. Shortly after that though, I found modafinil, and I wanted to try it. I ordered some online, and I couldn't be happier I did.

Modafinil is not something that can't be used and abused; whether I take 200mg or 600mg (besides side effects) it offers no other cognitive enhancing effect. Further, I have found that Moda is a 'booster' and not so much a 'pick me up' in that its effects work better when my physical and mental health is inclined and vice versa in that it seems to have little to no effect when physical and mental health is declined along with other factors such as sleep deprivation.

I usually like to skip a day between doses otherwise I get irritable and headaches. Sometimes I get irritable anyhow.

But as a full time project manager and full time student modafinil has certainly made life easier.

And it helps my memory I seem to retain more even after the physical effects have worn off.

Modafinil kept me awake and made me able to go to class or study when otherwise I would be too hungover or sleepy. Mainly my usage of Modafinil was to overcome bad planning or other vices which were influencing my capabilities to reach my academics goals. It more or less worked even if it didn't much for motivation. Doesn't fight procrastination like amphetamines do.

Interesting side effects were a distinct odor of my pee and more sexual drive. Also that is hard to predict when you're going to be affected. Being able to sleep, then wake up all wired. Not like caffeine etc in this respect which are pretty predictable.

I stopped taking Modafinil because it was just enabling me to binge drink and take too many drugs without many consequences academically. I did slip on that slippery slope and discontinued all my usage of recreational or non-recreational drugs with exception of coffee and tea. Another reason to not take it as a coffee substitute is that it was making my HPPD worse. Plus I grew tired of the, fun experience, nootropics/research chemical/drug usage of my 18-20."

"1224" "Though it's possible that the amount of outliers who have taken modafinil for less than a month is small, I am actually one of them but I didn't see a good way to indicate this in my responses to the questions.

I don't think I checked \"rash/itches\" when asked about \"sever side effects,\" though I have experienced very mild itching (less mild and more pronounced with adrafinil, based on limited experience). I didn't check the box because it was not severe in my case.

Itching is something I was very concerned by, especially in view of the statistically unlikely though severe risk of SJS, which appears to manifest in subtle allergic-reaction-esque symptoms before all sorts of fun body decay happens. It seems to me that based on the reported cases, the auto-immune reaction (SJS) isn't really obviated by discontinuing the drug. In other words, it seems like you'll have gotten on the SJS ride without knowing it, and by the time you do know it, you've been raised to the top of that 90' drop and proceed to fall. Quickly.

I think it would be interesting to survey users about their knowledge/awareness of negative modafinil side-effects. Additionally or alternatively, it may be interesting to learn the perceived likelihood of those side effects and maybe even the degree to which those side effects would deter them from using modafinil more frequently.

Great job, this was fun."

Maybe it is just an important day at work or often it's a long day at work followed by a meetup at night. Unfortunately I cannot currently tell whether it is because of what I do on a typical day in which I take Modafinil or whether it is because of the Modafinil itself but I always sleep terribly when I take it. I think I need to experiment by taking it on some \"normal\" days too. It also has a quite strong laxative effect on me. "

I wanted if i could get 1/10th of the effects of \"limitless\" it would be able to help achieve more out of life. In reality when first using Modafinil i think i had a huge placebo effect of completing things by convincing myself that the drug was making me do it. And thus over time this blind motivation died down. What i do have left to say does it work? Yes, is it a cognitive enhancer? Yeah it makes my mind work harder and faster, but doesnt always give the beautiful concise answer that your normal mind (not on anything does.

Big issues i find is that modafinil is a great start, but you run into the problems of brain fog, etc so you need to start educating yourself on further supplimenting your life which is long term rather scary. I find that after using modafinil for several days back to back the day off makes me feel like ive drained the life out of me so i could be on point on those  days i was on.

Other things: this stuff (when in my system) has made me extremely logical and critical, it can in a sense short circuit my social behaviour: ie  understanding and drawing connections to a concept before other people, and trying to continue on... which can result in people thinking you are being arrogant or rude etc, approaching life in a logical fashion which can cause tension. It overall makes me more ambitious/aggressive in a sense i would draw the analogy to the bad guy/s in karate kid who are focused on their karate and are overally aggressive.

"1484" "It would be interesting if the survey was divided between armodafinil and modafinil as the effect of both are different. For me armodafinil has less side effects with the same focus and concentration that gives modafinil. However when in lack of motivation I prefer Modafinil with the same focus and concentration of Armodafinil. In addition the side effects and intensity depends on the brand. I've also tried Adrafinil with a lot of side effects so I suspended and never bought it again since January 2014. After that I've taking Modafinil and lately becoming exclusive on using only Armodafinil with exceptions like when in lack of motivation I prefer Modafinil. The dose is one 200 Modafinil or 150 Armodafinil one hour before breakfast, taking it one day and 2 days off which helps me diminish tolerance. Finally I keep record in a spreedsheet of every time I take a pill, brand, amount, stacks, descriptions of effects and side effects in order to check results, tolerance and other variables which has helped me a lot improving the effects."

Underwhelmed and disappointed at the drug's inability to dissolve all my problems (just kidding).

I got interested in modafinil after realising I had inattentive-type ADHD (in the process of formal diagnosis) and thinking the 'tunnel vision' effect would be useful, but I actually find that standard ADHD medication does that a lot more - modafinil makes me feel generally more observant of everything around me, but I can choose what to focus on, which I actually much prefer.

Your average American does not have enough sense to come in out of the rain. I am not among that ilk.

That being said, Modafanil and Armodafinil are fairly potent with respect to creating anxiety. I find that using clonezepam occasionally with Modafanil has very positive results if taken correctly. The same applies to low dose administration of cannabis extracts. Small amounts of CBD have a positive effect when using modafanil in cases where neurological damage is indicated. THC has an adverse effect (heightened anxiety)

I would never tell any other American about other drugs that can assist modafanil, because %97 of the American drug taking populace would run to the pharmacy and take an additional drug until they needed rehabilitation. Americans have very little self control when it comes to any pharmacological methods. Just my two rubles.

"1659" "I would like to stress the importance of a couple things I have discovered while being treated for chronic pain and taking -finil. First, Tramadol/Ultram seriously negates effects of -finil where a very high dosage is required for normal effects. Also and of great importance, I had surgery for my L4/L5 lumbar disc herniation that did not relieve neuropathic pain. By pure accident I discovered that modafinil will completely eliminate this constant burning I feel down my left leg as well as occasional stabbing pain in my left foot.  This pain is left over nerve-root stimulation/damage from the herniation. I tried to find similar experiences from people but it appears no one has reported similar findings. I would encourage the medical community to look into this as a source of pain relief as Gabbapentin and Lyrica, the usual treatments for neuropathy, were completely useless to me and had awful side effects.  I have been on all kinds of opiates; hydrocodone, hydromophone, methadone, oxycodone,  tramadol, and morphine that at best would dull the pain a little, even on extreme doses. None came close to the absolute cessation of the pain that -finil provides and its a shame that I essentially have to break the law to obtain it, as nueropathy is not even considered an off-label use of modafinil and I can't find a doctor who would write a script and even if I did, insurance would never cover it."

"1820" "Around the time I started using modafinil, my performance at work improved dramatically, and I suddenly felt I was achieving my potential. I had spent a year with very low output, and was considering leaving my career and retraining as a high-school teacher. Since taking modafinil, I've published important papers, and have come to be seen as a leader in my field.

After reading about modafinil, I wanted to try some. I decided to try a simpler experiment, first. I went around the corner to a supplement store, and bought a \"pre-workout\" powder, which I'd heard had a distinct effect. The ingredients listed what looked like phenephylamine pre-cursors (the brand name was \"Crave\". Later it was found to contain N,α-diethylbenzeneethanamine (or phenylisobutamine), described as a methamphetamine analogue). My idea was that if this stuff helped me work, I should definitely try better options.

Results were very positive: I immediately started lifting out of a nine month slump.

I don't know whether I \"have\" ADHD, a form of depression, or some other precise alignment with a common condition. All I know is Modafinil is good for what ails me. Before taking Modafinil, I would always feel nap inclined during the day, and would find excuses to procrastinate. Over time I would lose momentum, and I'd enter aversive spirals that made it more and more difficult to be productive.

I've had up to two months off modafinil at various times, depending on the details of getting supply. There's no acute withdrawal, but I do return to \"baseline\", and productivity is likely to slip. I'm less happy when this occurs.

I find armodafinil about 30% more effective for me, over the medium or long term, because I find I build less tolerance to it.

"1824" "Very useful for trips abroad. Long flights (+12hrs) usually leave me quite sleepy for a day or two which makes it difficult to get straight into work. With modafinil I can get straight into work and keep it going for a week by taking 2 x 50mg doses spread throughout the day, and I can still get to sleep at night & it doesn't affect my appetite. The nice thing about modafinil is you don't feel the drug (like with an amphetamine), but rather a lack of tiredness. Makes it easy to carry on with work.


That said - I'd be hesitant to take it consecutively for longer than a week.

Found modafinil was primarily useful in moderating / balancing my sleep patterns, plus clear improvements in concentration and motivation most days. Experienced mild headaches perhaps 3/10 times testing dosages of 200mg+. During self testing over the 3 months, found my optimum usage was typically 100mg per dose per day, taken 4 days per week (with occasional variation up to 200mg on an isolated day, and up to 5 days in a week). Regular usage seemed to bring on some mild tolerance, which was apparently mitigated by taking 2 to 3 days off/week -- hence conclusions about my optimum usage pattern."

"1967" "While I've never been tested for it, my theory is that I am sleep deprived and could very well benefit from a sleep study and probably a CPAP device to improve my sleep.  For years I would sit in afternoon meetings (important ones even) and could not stay awake, especially if I had eaten a lunch. Modafinil in my mind returns me to a normal level of functioning, since others aren't falling asleep all afternoon.  However, I have never been  able to use modafinil on a daily basis without my body protesting by developing a cold or early signs of bronchial distress and what I believe would actually turn into ammonia if I push it. Because of this there are times I go weeks or months without modafinil, thinking it's not in my best interest to distress my physical body. For the last year or two I've developed a two to three times a week habit that seems to be working for me.  Finally before I forget, there is one more, important at least for me, side effect of taking modafinil.  It makes me more talkative, but almost always in very positive ways, better able to sell, better able to socialize, more persuasive in arguments, more thoughtful and in depth, often way beyond where others will go. Once I've gone without modafinil more than a couple of days, I return to normal levels of all the above. I guess this is the cognitive benefit for me, and is perhaps more important than I answered on the survey."

I've used modafinil to skip sleep once, maybe twice, in the last year, but I use it more more often in the day time. I skipped sleep on modafinil much more often when I started it.

Hard to answer questions about \"typical\" modafinil order, how often, etc. because I haven't been using it for that long (and try to order what I expect will be a year's supply at a time).

Not sure if I've developed tolerance. I'm partial to the hypothesis that modafinil \"tolerance\" is often just missed sleep catching up with people, which is a major reason I now generally avoid skipping sleep with modafinil.

I said I could quit cold turkey, though I wouldn't want to. If I forget my morning modafinil dose before going to work, I feel drowsy and unproductive, and typically end up trying to compensate by slamming energy drinks. I don't think this is addiction, though, as I had major issues with daytime drowsiness (and accompanying caffeine addiction) before I started using modafinil.

I put down a 1 for the effectiveness for vitamin D and creatine, because they don't have *noticeable* effects, but I take them anyway, because I think there's a decent chance they're correcting nutritional deficiencies.

I put down a 4 for the effectiveness of Adderall, because the one time I tried it the effects were huge and obvious, yet not quite what I wanted–developed obsessive focus on whatever was in front of me, not necessarily what I wanted to focus on. Modafinil seems much better at allowing me to focus on what I want to focus on."

I now sit down, and hammer out the work that needs to be done, which completely alleviates the guilt associated with incomplete or overdue tasks, which has also now led to me giving myself more time off, full days without touching work or feeling like I need to get caught up, therefore improving my overall quality of life by helping me stay on top of everything."

At 50mg (a quarter of a 200mg Modalert tablet), I have found the perfect dosege for improved focus. 100mg or 200mg leave me unpleasantly tunnel-visioned for the duration - like I'm unable to step back and assess the larger picture.

Combination with Yohimbine (10-15mg) increased the potency (subjectively) by 30-50% (felt like 100mg), and duration to 16hrs+.

1) I have a good and tightly regulated sleep schedule going to bed around 9-9:30 pm and waking at 4:45 to 5 am, everyday of the week (This is enforced by my work schedule, my workout/gym routine, and my nightly Melatonin / Chamomile tea combo).  I've always been a morning person who normally gets sluggish in the afternoon.
2) I have an incredibly fast metabolism and am really thin.
3) I rarely take Caffeine (once every couple months), only once used Adderall, and only experimented a few times with Nicotine gum/patches (which I promptly gave up because it made me really nauseous due to probably a too high dose and am really averse towards experimenting with it again).  I do also take 300 mg fish oil pills 3x/day, and have been doing this for years now, though I am not able to witness or come up with an experiment to test for any possible benefits.  I take them more due to daily ritual than anything else.
4) I eat rather healthy with no high carb meals making me have sudden swings in energy levels (like I experienced in undergrad).  I do eat lots of protein bars/shakes and 3 eggs a day (always been a big egg consumer since I was young), so I probably have a relatively high amount of daily choline.
5) I later suspected that Modafinil might not be helping me much because I might already be considered \"high functioning\".  This suspicion and belief might of framed my perceived results after 2 weeks or so and decreased any possible effectiveness (like a reverse placebo).  This might be made worse by the fact that I am academically neuroscience-trained (with an emphasis in neurochemistry) and am usually INCREDIBLY skeptical of \"nootropics\", athough I read a lot about them and continue to show a lot of interest.  I also work in the nutraceutical/pharmaceutical business doing wet-lab bench work, and that insider knowledge makes me skeptical of much of the \"science\" (pop marketing) literature written since they don't agree most of the time with what I find on the lab bench.  In summary, I acknowledge and would like you to be aware that my skepticism might be biasing or masking any possible beneficial effects.  I do continue taking it every now and then because I notice the lack of afternoon sluggishness / brain fog (or delayed rather).

(***By the way, I am an incredible fan of your writing.  Your long term empirical perspective is admirable.  Thanks for just existing and doing what you do.)"

Much more recently, I have been using Indian generics (both Modalert and Modvigil, both of which seem around equally effective) every few days and they do not seem as effective.  (Specifically, I always get energy/alertness, but only sometimes get improved focus, maybe 1/3 of the time.  This variation happens randomly and does not seem to be correlated with anything else, so I keep taking it in hope of getting lucky.)

I don't know whether this is (1) tolerance, (2) difference between generics and Provigil, or (3) some body/brain change in my in the last ~4 years.  I suspect it isn't (1), since I noticed the difference when I first started taking the generics, and taking holidays hasn't changed anything."

My body still gets tired and achey, though, and my cognitive abilities gradually decline into uselessness and paranoia after about 48 hours without sleep.

There are two side effects that convinced me to stop taking it.

1) Edginess: On modafinil, I do not get hungry, and eating is unpleasant. Not eating, though, eventually results in shakiness and misery as one might expect. It also puts my stomach on edge. Combined with a cup of coffee, my gag reflex is bizarrely elevated (even when I'm not doing anything that one would think would trigger gagging). I also grind my teeth and fidget more. I'd summarize this as general physical edginess.

2) Difficulty sleeping: Unless I'm really sleep deprived, I have trouble falling asleep while I'm on modafinil. Sometimes it causes me to lie awake for many hours and ruins the following day."

One thing I definitely noticed if I took too much or even if I took a regular dose on too little sleep, was that I felt almost mentally unfit for being out in the world and socializing normally, my self-consciousness was practically screaming at me about how autistic I must seem to everyone.

Modafinil allows me to have predictable wakefulness periods and provides the cognitive push to achieve things I never thought myself capable of. Waking up from deep sleep is still an issue for me, but since I started taking moda, I've become financially independent as an entrepreneurial designer/fabricator and keep my own hours and sleep schedule.

I had a few issues taking this survey:
1. I was not allowed to enter '0' for number of times purchased modafinil. I've only ever borrowed it from friends and have never purchased it myself.
2. The effectiveness question should allow N/A. For example, I've never tried using modafinil at night to skip sleep, so I don't have a way of rating its effectiveness for that.

Modafinil itself:
Definitely keeps me awake, but seems like an inferior version of adderall or lisdexamfetamine. Both of the latter keep me awake and help me focus, whereas modafinil keeps me awake but frequently makes me feel too nervous/anxious/distressed to focus. Modafinil also gives me a significantly elevated heartrate, hyperventilation, butterflies in my stomach -- gives me all the physical sensations associated with extreme anxiety.

Modafinil's first dose provided a euphoria \"limitless\" effect the first time I took at 50mg.  That quickly went away.  If something is uninteresting, modafinil probably won't help.  Not substitute for sleep.  Caffeine almost works better for that.  Prevents needing to nap if doing something interesting.  I actually think, if used regularly, you can decrease the \"need\" for sleep.  But if you stop, you'll feel the sleep debt."

"2537" "Modafinil is an interesting pharmacological substance. I will say that there really isn't, at least for me, any sort of 'inspirational' or 'motivational' boost that I receive from taking Modafinil. Instead, I find the greatest benefit of Modafinil to be the reduction in fatigue throughout the day, thereby allowing one to stay focused on the task at hand for longer, or at least to a point at which fatigue would have inevitably reduced both performance and willingness. Basically, it allows an unperturbed natural state of mental focus which is conducive to prolonging productivity, but don't be fooled in thinking that it is the substance which will raise one to euphoric highs and great motivation to get things done, it is much more subtle than that. Nevertheless, it is of great benefit to not always be tired, especially if the week has been rather stressful. A caveat to this vivacity is the potential abuse of one's sleep schedule, if one is not careful. This isn't something that should be taken at night (or whenever you schedule your sleep) as it will obviously keep you up and perhaps ruin your circadian rhythm. Having said that, taking it properly among rising, at a reasonable dose, day in and day out, I have been able to sleep reasonably well at night, a full 7-8 hours, but that is considering if one has already a good sleep hygiene and routine set up. Furthermore, I would like to say that, yes, I have felt my heart rate increase at moments and then subside in quick order (perhaps as little as 4-5 times a day, very subtle), but these have been when I had my first dose, and now I hardly, if ever, get that response. I also cycle this 1 week on and off, and despite the first day off on the cycle being more cumbersome than the rest, the following days were just back to normal, and I haven't had any sort of addictive issues with it. Hope this helps."

- Modafinil makes me euphoric. I see the positive sides of things, I'm confident in the future, I know things will work out and great things are ahead. I do not really get that feeling with adderall.

- Modafinil increases my creativity. I've come up with several important technical ideas when resuming modafinil after a \"holiday\".

- I built tolerance over the years. I started at 25 mg and now 100 mg s what I need. There is also a short term tolerance. If use it more than a couple times a week, it starts losing its efficacy. It'll keep me awake for sure, but I will have none of the euphoria or cognitive enhacements. I often stop taking it for weeks at a time.

- It allows me to skip meal, but it does not cut my appetite. It just prevents me from *noticing* my appetite. I may simply forget to eat lunch, but if for some reason I have to eat lunch, I will eat as much as usual."

Adderall is the best.  5/5.  Focalin/Ritalin is 4.5/5.  Modafinil is like a 3.5/5.  Coffee is 3/5.

Nowadays I just use Sudafed (pseudoephedrine).  It is about a 3.5/5 without the negative side effects of modafinil, and it is easier and cheaper to get in any supermarket.

"2607" "I absolutely depend on Modafinil because I am Bipolar (type 2) and suffer from ADD.

One thing I did not see canvassed in the survey - detailed information on medical conditions and other medication. I imagine my scenario is not uncommon.

My bipolar medication (daily Lamotrigine and very occasionally Olanzapine)  make me foggy and fatigued. Dexamphetamine was highly effective in treating ADD however contributed to extended manic episodes that developed on one occasion into psychosis requiring hospitalisation.

I can no longer take any traditional stimulants (including Methylphenidate) to treat ADD symptoms. My doctor will not allow it due to the risk of inducing mania.

Aside from Modafinil, I have tried Strattera and a number of non-stimulant medications to treat ADD. None of them were effective.

Modafinil is the only drug I have tried that works to treat ADD just as well as traditional stimulants - but without any impact on my mood or inducing mania.

Without Modafinil I could not function at work. I have a good job in the technology sector requiring long periods of extended concentration.

As a side bonus, I no longer have any desire to take illicit drugs (amphetamines were my drug of choice as a shotgun approach to self-medicating ADD symptoms). I have been clean for 3 years. So modafinil is filling whatever neurochemical hole I used to plug with other substances. "
"2608" "I'm narcoleptic and, from reading about it, modafinil seemed like a lifesaver. Now that I'm taking it, I realize that higher doses mean more side  effects, but also make me more wakeful. It's a bit disheartening to transition from a life of constantly being tired to having a life of mostly being tired plus headaches."
"2609" "After experimenting with Modafinil over a few months (weekly rather than daily usage) I mostly avoid it now. As a generally healthy person who looks after themselves, I don't need the enrgy burst and jitters that come with Modafinil.

I became more outgoing, less fearful, made friends, bettered my life, fitness, grades and results at work. I learned that I could be and do pretty much what I wanted if I set my mind and my state of mind to it.

I have since stopped taking it and destroyed everything out of legal concerns, but would definitely recommend it to anyone able to get it legally.

Now I have gone back to legal alternatives, Nicotine (vaping with no other additives) and Caffeine, which have more side effects and work much worse, but at least won't get me jailed,fined or prevent me from being able to travel places or work certain jobs.

In my experience, the perfect combo with Modafinil was at 50mg (1/4th of Modalert 200) with 400mg Suntheanine, 5000 iu of Vitamin D3 taken upon wakeup, and occasionally some coffee."

Caffeine + modafinil seem to work well together, especially after the half-life of modafinil, but seems to have greater potential for rapid heart rate effects.

Would be interested in data on specific rather than general cognitive enhancement, for example I have the most creative ideas while using modafinil.

Would be interested to hear how the market shutdowns affect the buying habits of modafinil."

However, even when I only take 100mg in the morning it leaves me with insomnia that night. After a few days of consecutive use I am able to start falling asleep again, but by that point I am running on 3 days of terrible sleep, so the benefits are long past. Also, it often gives me headaches, which I find to be strongly correlated in strength with how sleep deprived I am. So although it is great at getting me to be able to focus when I otherwise would not be on those days when I may be running on very little sleep, the headaches make it rarely worth using for such a case when I could instead take a small dose of Adderall."

"2680" "Although I get the desired effects from modafinil (awakeness, feeling mentally \"fresh\", cognitive enhancement), modafinil when used on its own is a bit too \"edgy\" for me. This is not entirely fair; i usually use it in combination with low doses of caffeine, which is know to cause anxiety. Even when I don't plan on using caffeine, I usually still drink a cup of coffee or take a slow release caffeine pill (200 mg). I guess this is the dopamine talking (\"MORE!\"). Therefore, I usually take either a moderate dose of phenibut when I take modafinil. The two compliment each other nicely when not overdone. I should mention I am prone to anxiety, because I have aspergers syndrome. When using the two aforementioned substances together, I feel the positive effects of my Aspergers (i.e. analytical thinking, eye for detail, ability to hyperfocus,  all very useful as an organic chemist) get enhanced, while the negatives ((social) anxiety, overload of impulses) are greatly diminished."

"2900" "I find modafinil to be analogous to 'slow release caffeine'. It is like the alertness that caffeine would provide over 8-10 hours rather than the 30-60 minutes that coffee would give.

As far as I understand, it has a 15 hour halflife so daily dosing will slowly increase residual levels in the blood to a steady state and I find that it just becomes an impediment to good sleep rather than providing any benefit.

Overall, modafinil does not make you 'smarter' than you already are. It lets you perform at your own 100%, not more than what you could otherwise do on a well rested and 'good' day. Second point - daily intake results in impaired sleep which significantly negates any benefit of the drug. I have found alternate day dosing to be most effective by allowing one good night of sleep and drug free period in between."

I used Modafinil about 7 years ago for 6 months.  It was very helpful for school and motivation. After that it became hard to find legit vendors. I hadn't used it until recently when I discovered Modafinil Cat. I also had never tried armodafinil. I find armodafinil much more effective and with less side effects. It wakes me up and gives me motivation and focus. The only issue I've noticed is every once in awhile it can trigger hypo mania. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it helps pull me out of depression. I take adderall for ADHD/motivation, mood support, but after 3 years I noticed it quickly losing effectiveness. So I switched to armodafinil and now I rotate between the two to keep my tolerance in check."

3 times a week is average, although in quiet periods it goes down to once a week and in busier times up to every 2 days. I have tried taking 100mg every day, but after a week found that it stopped being effective.

Modifinil and the other brands don't have the normal adderall side-effects, which is the reason that I can stop taking it a few days and not have to worry about how long before I'll get more, if I were taking adderrall.  Plus overall side-effects are less dramatic when taking modifinil.

"3189" "Random comments about modafinil usage:::::

As a daytime user, I stabilized at a dosage of 200mg daily. I've tried upping this, but found that of 200mg, 300mg and 400 mg doses, that this was the best trade off relative to side effects.

Dosage: At 200mg I've found that the wakefulness effect is subtle on its own, but combines synergistically with caffeine. Judging by productivity, this is probably the most effective stack I've tried. Adding to this to attempt to forgo sleep has been ineffective, due to side effects, and the fact that I can sleep through the 200mg dosage somewhat easily

Side effects: None were very bad. Definitely notice more small red bumps at random places if I stop taking modafinil for a few days then start up again; At higher doses, even after certain dehydration and at the point the body has nothing left to give so to speak, the 'have to pee' sensation oddly remains which I found incredibly annoying; this seems to stimulate the bowels even more so than traditional strong stimulants

"3200" "Initially, I had a good experience with modafinil and employed it extensively during times of sleep deprivation. I noticed minor improvements in motivation and attention, as well as some noticeable improvements in the speed at which I responded to events. I led a demanding, fast-paced life  which meant that having a couple of \"off days\" was not an option. This hectic lifestyle led me to take the drug virtually everyday, and that's when the negatives of the drug began to outweigh the positives. Most significantly, the drug's long half-life coupled with my everyday use caused havoc on my sleep schedule and sleep quality. To be fair: I was advised against taking modafinil everyday, but in the end, I was looking for something that I could take almost everyday for enhancements in my productivity and attention; it became clear after a few weeks of continuous use that modafinil was not what I was looking for. Eventually, I gave up the drug for -in my opinion- a far better alternative: adderall, and I haven't looked back ever since.   "

I have trouble falling asleep on modafinil even if I take melatonin though, which is problematic and deters me from taking it more frequently.

I also don't feel like modafinil improves the quality of my cognitive function. If anything it is worse. The feeling makes me think of how Bilbo describes the Ring's effect on him in the LoTR movie - \"like butter scraped over too much bread\". I find modafinil to be most useful when I need to get a lot of mundane things done, but not as helpful when I need to do something that's very intellectually demanding. "

I took it around 10:00 this morning, stacked with caffeine (woo working on different receptors, even if we don't understand *finil's mechanism!); I studied with 100% engagement for 10 hours, only stopping to pee three times and once to put on pants when it started getting a bit colder. The whole time I was borderline giddy, although that's the state I usually get in when I work math problems sufficiently hard that I can barely do them.

I'd take it until tolerance set in, except I'm looking to ubersleep, so no stims."

"3271" "I wish half life is shorter"
"3272" "I used modafinil a few dozen times over a period of a couple years, beginning about 5 years ago; I think it was mostly Modalert but sometimes Spier brand. On one occasion half a 200mg tablet of Modalert made me sleepy, and the other half had the same effect on a colleague, so I assumed it was just a dodgy tablet, or maybe a reaction with something we'd eaten. On every other occasion (including on tablets from the same packet) it had the desired effect, plus common side-effects like mild headache, irritability and inability to sleep for about 24 hours after taking it.

I didn’t use it for a year or two after running out, partly because of the difficulty of obtaining it where as I was living and partly because I didn’t need it so much (fewer deadlines). Then I got some Modalert about 6 months ago (from a different supplier), and it had paradoxical effects, making me sleepy and ‘foggy’ and unable to work. To test if it was just a dodgy batch, I ordered 2 different brands of modafinil, plus some armodafinil, from a different site (Modafinilcat). However, they all have pretty much the same effect. Once or twice (out of maybe a dozen tries) I had great focus and productivity several hours after taking it, once the fogginess had worn off, but usually I didn’t even get that.

It seems unlikely that all of these are fake, especially since they give me the same side-effects as the real stuff I had before, so I guess there was some change in my ‘brain chemistry’ in the period between my early uses and now. I was on bupriopion for about a year for depression, and low-dose haloperidol for a few months to control tics (not psychosis), but I don’t know of any reason they would affect it.

I also have paradoxical/unusual reactions to a few other drugs, e.g. paracetam and sulbutiamine make me tired, foggy and restless (but they did this even during the period when I was taking modafinil successfully)."

One suggestion. Please show somehow that your Modalert is pure. Get it independently tested for safety and purity. My only worry ever is being given the wrong drug or a bad batch, which could harm me."

"3373" "i hope really hope that it doesn't become a controlled substance, as i would no longer be able to use it. it is not an addictive substance, and not a substance for abuse, so i can't comprehend why it would ever be restricted. Also, i believe that it can help so many people. a majority of people i know suffer from fatigue. it could really help them, as visiting the doctor etc and taking iron supplements in the case of anaemia is expensive/time consuming and may not be effective. also, it has helped with my depression, by giving me the energy/motivation to do things. i'm no longer depressed and i really believe that modafinil was the only thing that helped when i was. lethargy is a symptom of depression, but inactivity may also be a cause of depression. it's a cycle, and if you are tired- you don't want to do things, you get stuck in a rut, you become lethargic due to forgoing responsibilities,, you may become depressed, and depression may lead to exhaustion emotionally/physically or due to medication. i cannot emphasise greatly enough how modafinil has changed my life. also, the difference between prescribed antidepressants and modafinil is the frequency of use and side effects. common meds for depression require every day use, and have various side effects. also there are numerous interactions between antidepressants and various other substances- medications, alcohol, food or otherwise. The prescribing of modafinil for depression should be one of immediate consideration. "

"3425" " Before I start taken modafinil and then switch to armodafinil I found myself not being able to wake up in the morning anymore. I lost a lot of the will to want to wake up and do anything. It was like I was stuck in a big cloud.  I also have ADHD real bad and was prescribed Adderall and Ritalin most of my life I decided to stop taking it because they just didn't make me feel good and had bad crashes. I did a lot of research on this and this just seem like a miracle drug and I had to try it because I was very skeptical. My surprise the first time I tried it  I immediately felt bright and awake and alert within just 15-30 minutes. I got a painting done that day  and sold for $200. Then I started noticing that it made me want to get up early in the morning and actually do things that bettered myself. It made me want to go to work and have conversations with others. I was starting to feel more confidence around others again, which was really great. It  kind of made me feel like the old me again made me feel like it brought me back. All of the sudden I started caring about what people are saying ( not about me but what was going on in their life) and retaining the information they are telling me. And remembering all the things that I've forgotten about my life.    All of the sudden I started being on top of my game coming up with ideas better than what I was before and now I've become self-employed still got a ways to go but I'm on a cool wave ready to roll. That being said I take breaks from doing it I haven't done in probably about 30 days and I still am able to get up and do my thing  and not have much of a problem. My organization skills are still there I still feel the need to clean and just to take care myself now granted some mornings I'm starting to feel tired again after months of not taking it but I never once experience withdrawal from it or the need to take it  when I dont uhave it. I have a very addictive personality and I've been taking this for seven months to a year and I've never once felt addicted to it. I went three months no problem without. I believe this is safer than coffee to drink and technically when it comes down to it, it cost less than the coffee cup a day. My suggestion though.  Do not start upping the doses keep to your regular regimen wake up in the morning take it wait about 15-30 minutes eat two eggs go about your day take another quarter or a half a one in the middle of the day if you still need to stay up for a little while but don't go past that. And if you start feeling tired take you a 20 minute nap wake up it kicks right back in your ready to roll again. Sleep and a healthy diet is good thing. If u don't practice this then u can feel upset from time to time( stomach mild headache and fatigue). Cuz just because ur mind is still going your body and soul still need to rest. Rest is a good thing. But I suggest everybody try this out  if they experience these problems of waking up without energy and slight depression it breaks your right out of that. Thanks for listening.

I decided to go back to University at n40 and although kept m,y own in the first couple of years I realized that no sooner had one essay been finished, that there was a ton of research to be examined and cataloged so that to conduct the next one, My head wanted to explode there was no ending.

At this point when studying for a lecture I discovered smart drugs and the one that kept catching my eye was th of Modafil and once I received my order my essays are in on time, no last minute rushes, a motivation to get up in the morning and get started so that I could rest and go to bed at night not worry about the closeness of the deadlines and what not.

"3636" "I found modafinil to have greatest effect on focus if taken whilst preparing for or doing a task, such as revision. In such cases modafinil would allow me to \"super focus\" at the task at hand and the dry textbooks didn't seem so difficult anymore. If I took (at least a small dose) \"willy nilly\" then either no effect would be felt (except difficulty sleeping, if taken late in the day) or I would find something to focus on however inane, like cleaning my room.

Additionally, whilst completing my thesis and running out of time I \"overdosed\" and took over 1200mg in a 6-7hr period. After this my concentration did not feel improved (but I had pulled an all day session on little modafinil followed by an attempted all night session with heavy modafinil use). I noticed no anxiety or anything of the sort, but in the peripherals of my vision as well as dark incompletely resolved (to the eye) areas like shadowy book cabinets and dark windows I did notice hallucinations, and at one point I felt a presence alongside these hallucinations outside of my window. I felt no fear and I knew these were hallucinations from overdosing and lack of sleep, but nonetheless they occured."

"3678" "Do not underestimate the possible side-effects.
Dependancy is likely to occur with daily usage and a tolerance will be built up. I am currently studying pharmaceutical sciences (what an irony) and I am using modafinil almost daily.
I quit cold turkey for 6 weeks around 2 months ago and experienced heavy fatigue for 7 days and loss of motivation.
Modafinil will nevertheless be used by myself, since its benefits so far outweigh the side effects.
This being said, do not buy your medication from indian sellers.
Get a prescription for your local pharmacy, or if you really know your chemistry, synth it on your own.
The indian meds often contain various precursors and intermediates making the final product quite hazardous to the health.
I have tried indian generics bought online once and have found them to be causing a strong allergic reaction upon usage.

Using my selfsynthesized product, as well as pharmaceutical modafinil obtained in a pharmacy did NOT cause this adverse reaction.

therefore I highly advise against buying medication over the internet."

I find the lower dose (@ 50 mg) to be effective for my long term use pattern of @ 4x per week with no side effects. A full pill would result in some of the side effects listed in this survey.

Modafinil gives me a lot of focus but sometimes I end up with a headache.
Walkalert improves my focus but also gives me a good mood and general happiness (and energy). On the day I take Walkalert sometimes I get irregular heartbeats (I would say about 2-4 episodes in one day, each lasting up to 7 seconds). About 25-30% of times (on either pill) the next day I have an emotional low triggering depression. Going through my divorce after 14yrs with my wife doesn't help with the emotional balance either, but for me the good days on the pill are worth the risk.
I normally take one pill a day (half in the morning and half around 1pm) for a max of 3-4 days. Then I take a break of at least the same amount of days. Been using it for the last 7 months (only when required for max productivity) and so far no signs of tolerance.
All in all, my experience is very positive.
After a more than 20yrs in IT, I struggle to sit at the computer and be productive for more than 2-3 hours a day. With the pill I can easily sit at the computer for 6-10 hours. The pill also helps me increase the time between breaks."

Effects last from 7-12 hours after oral ingestion. Dissolving modafinil in water prior to consumption in addition to consuming on an empty stomach dramatically increases the onset of desired effects.

This survey was incomplete in its scope; it failed to ask users what specific negative side effects were experienced, glossing over an important aspect of the product in question."

"3730" "Amazing product. I love it. No negative side affects aside from smelly urine. No crash. No addictive-tendencies. Can pick and choose whenever I take it--it will work when I take it and I don't take it when I don't need it and have never  had cravings etc. Never had headaches. Can sleep easily after dosing--I just don't feel the NEED to sleep, but I still sleep like a baby. Overall the most phenomenal product I've ever had the luxury to try, I much prefer it to my 30mg instant release adderall; it has a far nicer mood enhancement quality to it, far more motivational, no crash, no jittery feelings. I found this product as a Senior in high school when I was struggling through calculus (which thanks to modafinil I 4.0 and was able to conquer that class which was the last obstacle between me and graduating valedictorian. I also tested COMPLETELY out of math upon entering college, almost done with semester 1 of my sophomore year and I won't ever take another (required) math course again). Overall, I prefer armodafinil to modafinil, however I can get the same affects of armodafinil via modafinil by taking 300-350mg of modafil (comparable to 150mg of armodafinil). Plus my source for modafinil is unrealistically cheap, but he cannot source armodafinil and every vendor i've found charges far too much for it.

Overall i LOVE modafinil and will continue taking it as long as I could because it has only been a positive addition to my life with absolutely no negative side affects after a full 2 years of using it. I absolutely love it to the point where I think they should put this stuff in the water supply (only slightly joking; I understand the ill affects this may possible cause but you get the point)."

"3834" "I was originally prescribed Provigil for excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. At the beginning, it was a miracle drug. Once I learned that there was a reason for being tired all the time and then began to treat my condition with a CPAP and Provigil, it was like the disappearance of a fog I didn't know had been there, the scales falling from my eyes, walking out of Plato's cave for the first time, etc.

Unfortunately, the effects did not last. After a few months, my sleep doctor upped the Provigil dosage, and then continued to do so steadily over the next several months or a year.

After that, he switched me to Nuvigil. Again, the effects returned (though not nearly as strong as they had been originally). However, the effects once again diminished steadily over time.

Nowadays, I'm prescribed Adderall (20 mg up to 3x day), but I still keep a stock of ar/modafinil on hand to take occasionally, but always after a long layoff in between. Even then, I'd still only rate the current effects of either as a 2.

I wish I had SNP data to contribute, because I am very interested in learning whether there is a genetic component to efficacy/tolerance.

Regardless, I look forward to seeing the results of the survey. Cheers!"
