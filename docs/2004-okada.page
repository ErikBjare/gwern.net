customers who demand high standards. As a producer of video and manga magazines, I was keenly aware of their standards and thought, "They make me work really hard because they won't fall for cheap tricks."

## Generational Debate

`Takashi Murakami:` I have to confess, I don't think I fully understand the _moe_ sensibility.

`Toshio Okada:` The _moe_ generation is mostly made of _otaku_ 35 or younger.

I myself belong to the previous _otaku_ generation, so frankly I don't understand _moe_.

The generational shift is abrupt. Some people below a certain age know what _moe_ is about. But those of us above that age can't figure out why they like _bishojo_ so much. It seems to us that they like anything involving beautiful young girls.

There is a general debate. The liveliest topic in the _otaku_ world these past few years has been this generational debate.

Among themselves, _otaku_ refer to belonging to this generation or that.

`Kaichiro Morikawa:` I'm not that interested in the generational debate. Once you have a clear definition of _otaku_, then you can have a generational debate. But there is no generally accepted framework for understanding _otaku_. So it's futile to subdivide _otaku_

`T. Okada:` Morikawa-san, what is your definition of _otaku_?

`K. Morikawa:` If you track the central focus of so-called _otaku_ through the generations, Okada-san's generation focused on science fiction, followed by a generation that favored anime, which was in turn followed by another interested in _moe_ anime and _bishojo_ games. How did this evolution take place? Manga provide a handy example. Before I was born [in 1971], college students reading manga on the trains were considered a serious social problem.

Back then, manga were for children. Grown-ups were supposed to watch TV dramas. Foreign TV dramas were better than domestic ones, and films were even better than that. And European films were considered more sophisticated than Hollywood

[pg175]

movies. There was a clear cultural hierarchy, and manga were at the bottom. The spiteful label of _otaku_ was attached to grown-ups who had unacceptable tastes and still enjoyed kids' stuff.

As far as society is concerned. today's _otaku_ taste for _moe_ is more repugnant than watching porn. Eroticism is not the only motivation that informs their fascination with _moe_. They have a strong urge for what is unacceptable.

_Otaku_ who buy _Weekly Dearest My Brother_ not only feel affection for toy figures, but also enjoy being the kind of people who "buy embarrassing, tasteless things."

`TO:` _Otaku_ are bashful. They are intelligent but so bashful that they're more comfortable with children's anime than with regular movies. They can shed their reserve if a serious idea is filtered through a "Made for Children" label. I suspect that people who love toys and figures, manga, and anime love them because they can see the world through this filter of reticence.

_Otaku_ consume this stuff because of the twist that indulges their shyness.

At any rate, I have never seen an orientation toward the unacceptable among _otaku_.

For example, _Space Battleship Yamato_^[_Space Battleship Yamato_ (_Uchu senkan Yamato_; broadcast in the U.S. as _Star Blazers_) was a breakthrough TV anime series, first broadcast in Japan in 1974. See pl. 27 and Sawaragi's essay.] dates from the first half of the 1970s, followed by _Mobile Suit Gundam_^[_Mobile Suit Gundam_ (_Kido senshi Gandamu_), first broadcast in 1979, was a TV anime series that spawned a long line of sequel series. See pl. 30.].

Now, Morikawa-san, would you say _Gundam_ was more unacceptable than _Yamato_? I don't think so.

The more examples I show you, the less solid your theory becomes.

`KM:` Well, let me repeat myself. Being no good, _dame_, doesn't mean the quality is poor. On the contrary... the quality is very high, but it's a matter of self-consciousness on the part of _otaku_. They are concerned that their self-indulgence appears socially unacceptable.

`TO:` Well, then, do you mean from the mid- to late 1970s, things got progressively more unacceptable from _Yamato_ to _Gundam_, and then _Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind_?^[_Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind_ (_Kaze no tani no Naushika_; modified and released in the U.S. as _Warriors of the Wind_) first took form in 1982 as a serialized manga epic (serialized through 1994), created by Hayao Miyazaki (see note 20), who went on to direct the 1984 film based on the manga. Princess Nausicaa, who grows up in a safe haven insulated from the polluted world a thousand years after a great war, uses her intellect, heart, and courage to protect everything she loves.] I don't think so.

An inclination for _dame_ appears to exist because _otaku_ have shifted to _bishojo_ these past few years. Within this limited context, you may have a point, but veteran _otaku_ have to disagree.

`KM:` Generally speaking, I see a downward spiral.

Aum Shinrikyo^[For Aum Shinrikyo, an armed cult group that released deadly Sarin gas on Tokyo subways, see Sawaragi's essay.] was influenced by _Genma Wars_.^[_Genma Wars_ (_Genma taisen_), a story about people with supernatural abilities who fight Genma (Phantom Demon) to protect the Earth, originated as a series of books by Kazumasa Hirai. The novels were adapted by Shotaro Ishinomori as manga, and were subsequently made into an anime film in 1983 (released as _Harmagedon_ in the U.S.).] In the 1980s, _otaku_ dreamt of Armageddon; they fantasized about employing supernatural powers to create a new world after the end of the world.

But Aum's subway attack in 1995 thoroughly shattered the post-apocalyptic _otaku_ dream of creating a new world in which they would be heroes.

After their apocalyptic fantasies collapsed, they steadily shifted to _moe_. Before their Armageddon obsession, there was science fiction, which provided _otaku_ with an alternative to the actual future. In the broadest terms, _moe_ has replaced the "future".

`TO:` But your definition of science fiction is narrow. In Japan, science fiction was viable as a literature of alternative futures only through the 1930s. From the 1960s onward, science fiction became socially conscious, a lens into alternative societies.

In Japan science fiction was associated with the future only during the brief period between World Wars I and II. As you know, _Japan Sinks_^[For the science-fiction novel _Japan Sinks_ (_Nihon chinbotsu_), see Sawaragi's essay.] by Sakyo Komatsu, a blockbuster in 1973, wasn't a story about the future. Futuristic science fiction never took off here.

[pg177]

`T. Murakami:` Morikawa-san, how do you define the "future"?

`KM:` The future is not merely a time yet to come. It's a vision of the world based on scientific understanding.

`TO:` Again, that is true only through the 1940s. Even the visions of the future presented by Robert A. Heinlein and Isaac Asimov were discredited by the harsh attacks from the New Wave movement.^["New Wave science fiction, characterized by its philosophical bent, arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Representative writers include J.G. Ballard in the U.S. and Koichi Yamano in Japan." (Okada)]

Whether we're talking about science fiction or anime, our views are so divergent. I don't see things the way you do, Morikawa-san. Not at all.

`KM:` You mean, we have an unbridgeable gap?

`TO:` Not necessarily. I am sympathetic to your observation that _Expo '70_^[_Expo '70_, held in Osaka in 1970, was the first World's Fair in Asia. Under the theme of "Progress and Harmony of Mankind", it featured a wide range of technological triumphs as well as projections for the future - from space technology (the U.S. pavilion exhibited a moon rock and an Apollo spacecraft) to a monorail, moving  sidewalks, and electric cars, to computer-linked information services.] prefigured an _otaku_ landscape, and that today's _otaku_ are fascinated with _moe_. But as far as your definition of _otaku_ is concerned, I think you are wrong. Because we are reading different "texts".

`TM:` I'm beginning to see a crucial generation gap between Okada-san and Morikawa-san. Speaking from my generation, I, too, find _otaku_ more compelling than _moe_.

`TO:` Murakami-san, I know you are preoccupied with _otaku_, but I don't think _otaku_ will generate anything more interesting than _moe_.

I belong to a group of model-tank makers. When I meet with them, I can't tell them apart from the guys who obsess about _moe_. They carry backpacks and wear sweatsuits. They look like stereotypical _moe_ enthusiasts, but you never know which toy figure - _bishojo_ or model thank - they're going to pull out of their backpacks.

If we refer to them as a "tribe", they all belong to the same tribe, but the model-tank guys are never into _bishojo_. Actually, they hate _bishojo_.

`KM:` How are they different from _mania_?

`TO:` To answer your question, I have to go back to my own definition of _otaku_. The sole difference between _mania_ and _otaku_ is their social acceptability. _Otaku_ are _mania_ who are socially rejected. Conversely,

[pg178]

[Caption top left: _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_ 2004 Film poster]

the hobbies of _mania_ are those that are socially accepted.

For example, the moment girls decide that motorbikes aren't cool, motorbike _mania_ become motorbike _otaku_. It's just a matter of societal labeling. That's the only difference between _mania_ and _otaku_.

`KM:` Doesn't that mean they are oriented toward the unacceptable?

`TO:` No, it doesn't. Even if a motorbike _mania_ suddenly becomes a motorbike _otaku_, he doesn't become an _otaku_ because he is unacceptable. He only becomes unacceptable because society says he is.

Let's use an extreme example. It's possible that one day the Japanese people will suddenly be defined as unacceptable. Say we become the enemy of the world for some reason.

Would you then say we Japanese are inherently unacceptable? I don't think so. It boils down to the question of societal labeling.

`KM:` In that case, let's suppose that one day anime is legitimized and enters school textbooks. Would _otaku_ obsessed with anime today still love anime then? I think not. That's not plausible.

Okada-san, if we accept your definition, _otaku_ should love anime regardless of how society values it.

If anime became so wonderful that schoolteachers recommended it to their students, would _otaku_ still seek out anime? I seriously doubt it.

`TO:` I can prove you wrong. Some _otaku_ works are socially accepted, others are not. Anime films by, say, Hayao Miyazaki or Mamoru Oshii are respected. Have _otaku_ lost interest and quit watching them? No.

I don't think societal labeling affects what they are attracted to. In fact, many _otaku_ support Mamoru Oshii's latest animated film, _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_.^[Oshii's _Innocence_ (2004, released as _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_ in the U.S.) was nominated for the Cannes Film Festival in 2004.]

Morikawa-san, when you talk about _dame_, the unacceptable, aren't you talking about "literature" (_bungaku_)? For practitioners of _jun-bungaku_^["As opposed to popular and mass literature, _jun-bungaku_ (pure literature) aspires to achieve the purity of art, eschewing popular tastes and a wider reception. Within Japan's literary establishment, _jun-bungaku_ often means the 'I' novel, which focuses on the author's private experiences and feelings. Representative writers of _jun_bungaku_ include Yukio Mishima and Osamu Dazai." (Okada)] [literally, "pure literature"], literature was about becoming unacceptable. After _Evangelion_^[_Evangelion_, commonly known as _Eva_, is shorthand for the TV anime series _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ (_Shin-seiki Evangerion_, or "New Century Evangelion"), first broadcast in 1995-96, and its cinematization (1997), both created by the anime studio Gainax. See pl. 33.] came out as a TV anime series in 1995, everybody fell in

[pg179]

[Caption top right: _Masked Rider_ 1971-1973 TV anime [??? --Editor] series]

love with _dame_.

Until then, literature was relevant only within the realm of pure literature. Some rock musicians may have liked it a bit. But, thanks to _Evangelion_, ordinary people, young people enthusiastically embraced it. _Eva_ made it OK for the main character to be pathetic. By the standards of conventional anime, it's inconceivable that _Eva_'s main character doesn't try harder. But that's precisely what makes him so appealing today. While literature used to shock and surprise us in the past, anime shocks and surprises us today. A _dame_-orientation is not a new thing; in the old days, a _dame_-orientation was called literature.

`KM:` Don't you think _Gundam_ got a similar reception? The main character was a computer geek.

`TO:` In _Gundam_, one thrust of the story was the main character's desire to be recognized by others. So _Gundam_ and _Eva_ are completely different.

`KM:` As I said before, the 1980s-era fascination with the apocalyptic was shattered by Aum. I think _moe_ emerged as an alternative, to fill the void.

`TO:` I see. To me, _Eva_ was all about "Since I can't do anything about changing the world, I will do something about myself." Don't you think "robot anime"^["Robot anime" is a popular genre of anime that features powerful or otherwise extraordinary robots as protagonists or the central theme of the story. The very first robot anime was _Astro Boy_ (_Tetsuwan Atom_), which was also the first anime TV series in Japan, broadcast in 1963. In recent years, robot anime has become "giant robot anime", the most representative example of which is _Mobile Suit Gundam_ (see pl. 30).] is all about "trying to change the world"?

Morikawa-san, you talked about the apocalyptic. One step before that is "social reform" (_yo-naoshi_). One of the key concepts for understanding _otaku_ is "a child's sense of justice". The reason grown-ups are enthusiastic about _Kamen Rider_^[_Masked Rider_ is a TV special-effects series, first broadcast in 1971-73. The heroics of the title characters, who are "altered humans" battling against the evil organization Shocker, have been perpetuated by spin-off Riders in subsequent series, which continue to this day,] and the "warrior team" genre (_sentai mono_)^[The "warrior team" genre, which originated in the special-effects TV series _Himitsu sentai Gorenja_, or "Secret Team of Five Rangers" (released in the U.S.n as _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_), has enjoyed tremendous popularity in Japan since _Gorenja_ was first broadcast in 1975. The "team" concept, derived from the "double riders" scheme of _Masked Rider_, customarily allows the inclusion of one female fighter.] is because that basic sense of justice, which we abandoned in society long ago, is still meaningful in the world of these TV shows.

Of course, there's also the terrific monster designs and _pan-chira_ [the fleeting display of girls' panties], but that's not enough to keep the boys interested. That basic sense of justice worked until _Eva_. But with _Eva_, it became clear that no one could save the world. And _Eva_ complicated the whole thing, raising issues such as "Maybe I should at least save myself" and "What's wrong with me, thinking only"

[pg180]

[Caption top left: _She, the Ultimate Weapon_ 2002 (original TV broadcast) DVD of TV anime series (cover)]

"about saving myself?" _Eva_ marked a turning point. Whatever we discuss today, we cannot avoid _Eva_.

`KM:` After _Eva_, a genre called _sekai-kei_ [literally, "world-type"] emerged, and it's very popular now. In this genre, private feelings and emotions are directly linked to the fate of the world.

`TO:` _She, the Ultimate Weapon_^[_She, the Ultimate Weapon_ (_Saishu heiki kanojo_) originated in 2000 as a serialized manga by Shin Takahashi (translation published as _The Last Love Song on This Little Planet_). It was made into a TV anime series in 2002, and adapted as a game in 2003.] is the definitive _sekai-kei_.

`KM:` And _Eva_.

`TO:` Reading just a couple volumes of _She, the Ultimate Weapon_ will give you a sense of the _sekai_-type sensibility.

In the typical logic of _sekai-kei_, the same weight is assigned to one's private emotions and the end of the world. In _She_, the world comes to an end. The main character witnesses the annihilation of the world, which happens to be caused by his girlfriend. His love for her and his despair over the destroyed planet are expressed through the same emotion.

But making a _sekai-kei_ ends artists' careers.

`KM:` You mean, like Hideaki Anno,^[Hideaki Anno is a screenwriter and director whose best-known work is the TV anime series _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ and its cinematization (se pl. 33). After _Evangelion_, Anno shifted his interest from anime to live-action films, and in 1998 directed the feature film _Love & Pop_, based on Ryu Murakami's novel; he created his first special-effects scenes in his 2004 film, _Cutie Honey_.] who created _Eva_?

`TO:` That's right. Anno-san has been in rehabilitation ever since [by getting away from anime and working on live-action films].

## By Way of Conclusion: _Otaku_ and Art

`Takashi Murakami:` While listening to you, it dawned on me that _otaku_ is much like Pop in the art world. There are many kinds of Pop, each of which is generationally defined.

The _otaku_ Okada-san believes in is comparable to the serious medium of "painting" in art, while the _otaku_ defined by Morikawa-san is akin to my work, as a "failed _otaku_".

`Toshio Okada:` Right. Murakami-san, you marketed _shokugan_^[Contemporary _shokugan_ originated in _gangu gashi_ (literally, "toy candy"), first introduced in 1922, which were candies packaged with small toys and targeted at children. In 1999, the _shokugan_ boom was launched by Furuta's "Choco Egg", a chocolate shell containing elaborately detailed plastic animal and insect figures manufactured by Kaiyodo, which set the standard for things to come. The extremely high quality of today's _shokugan_ has made them objects of adult - and _otaku_ - fascination, as demonstrated by Murakami's _shokugan_ series, _Superflat Museum_ (2003).] [literally, "food toys"] last year. I think the toy figures of _Weekly Dearest My Brother_ are far more _otaku_ than yours, precisely because you are a failed _otaku_. Their work is more creative, whereas your _shokugan_ are very commercial. If you ask me

[pg181]

[Caption right bottom: _Takashi Murakami's Superflat Museum: Convenience Store Edition_ 2003 Plastic figures and figure assembly kits packaged with gum, brochures, and certificates.]

which is "art", I would say those of _Weekly Dearest My Brother_.

But the problem is that your work is more recognized socially as art - which makes it so hard for me to understand art.

`T. Murakami:` In today's discussion, a few things became clear: the huge gap between those who know _moe_ and those who don't, as Morikawa-san told us; the generational debate among _otaku_; and the three different positions we have - that is, I am in art; Okada-san, in _otaku; and Morikawa-san, in _moe_.

`Kaichiro Morikawa:` Okada-san, I don't know if it's a fair categorization, but generationally speaking, your _otaku_ experience was from a time when people respected _otaku_ for their achievements.

I had the opposite experience, belonging to the generation that suffered _otaku_-bashing.^[In 1989, a landmark event turned _otaku_ into a household word: the serial murders of young girls by Tsutomu Miyazaki. When the ever-curious mass media discovered that the alleged murderer's room was filled with numerous volumes of manga and thousands of videotapes of anime and other genres of popular culture, the whole nation was stunned by his obsessive nature. The world _otaku_ was closely associated with Miyazaki's profile - a weirdo unable to form meaningful relationships with grown women or distinguish reality from fantasy. The mass media went on the attack against _otaku_, and children interested in anime and games were frequently harassed and ostracized at school.] In our discussion, I emphasized the unacceptability of _otaku_, and you said I was "completely wrong". I wonder if this reflects our contradictory experiences.

`T. Okada:` For argument's sake, let's assume you define _otaku_ as the self-proclaimed fans of _gyaruge_^[_Gyaruge_ is an abbreviation of "gal games". It is a subcategory of _bishojo_ games (see note 22) that does not contain sexual content, and is thus available to people under eighteen. The most representative example is _Tokimeki Memorial_.] and _bishojo_ figures, who are about thirty or younger today. If you say this group of people have such and such _dame_-orientation, I would have to agree.

But I don't think _otaku_ are limited to this group. _Otaku_ encompass many diverse types. That's why I can't agree with you. And this brings me back to my initial statement, which is that I quit _otaku_ studies, because I thought that there were no more _otaku_.

`TM:` We'll have to reconvene some other day to discuss more about the relationship between _otaku_ and art. Morikawa-san and Okada-san, thank you so much for today's discussion.
