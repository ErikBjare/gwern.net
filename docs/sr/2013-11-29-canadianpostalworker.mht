				Hello,<br>This is a throw away account, and no PM's will be answered or=
 even checked. I am using multiple reflectors to get to this forum beyond=
 simple TOR.<br><br>Background (bear with me):<br><br>I am a CBSA (Canadian=
 Border Service Agent in a CCRA/ Canada Post clearing house. (the Candian=
 version of the IRS in the USA). My job is secondary inspection, and I am=
 what's called a team lead (first level management inside the government hi=
erarchy).<br><br>Three years ago, I was in an accident, the nature of which=
 I will not disclose for security reasons. My rehab took over a year of exe=
rcise and a steady diet of Demerol (Meperidine) (50mg) IM, and Ativan (1mg)=
 at least twice a day.=C2=A0 Eventually the Demerol was switched out for Di=
laudid (Hydromorphone).=C2=A0 My physical health is better, but I have deve=
loped a nasty dependence on Opiates and Benzo's since that I have been unwi=
lling/unable to kick.<br><br>This was not a problem, as I had a friendly do=
ctor, but lately the OXY scare has made even the most liberal MD switch peo=
ple off to things like Toradol (Ketorolac) and Talwin (Pentazocine) in orde=
r to avoid the hassles from the CMA (Canadian Medical Association.) and los=
e their prescribing license.<br><br>I know all the ER shopping tricks, and=
 ER nurses and doctors do too. That is a pointless endeavour.=C2=A0 I have=
 acquaintances who are B.R.M (if I have to explain that one, you don't need=
 to know), who hook me up occasionally, but they want unreasonable favors=
 in my official capacity as payment.<br><br>SR. Is a god-send.=C2=A0 The pr=
ices are terrible for somebody like me on a government salary, but some cre=
ative juggling has allowed me to control my habit.=C2=A0 I talked to severa=
l separate vendors who have expressed concerns shipping to Canada because=
 of our strict customs regimen. So my gift back to you international vendor=
s is some tricks of the trade to increase the likelyhood of you getting you=
r packages through.<br><br>1: Do not use brown bubble wrap envelopes with=
 pre-printed BS looking return addresses that do not match the postmark.=C2=
=A0 That's going to secondary.<br><br>2: Never pack glass. It tinkles, in=
 transit, even surrounded in bubble wrap, it's hard/impossible to hide it's=
 shape from our BSX scanners. We seize more steroids than any other drugs=
 because of this.<br><br>3: Do not try to use perfume/cologne/coffee/patcho=
uli/sage to hide tell-tale odours.=C2=A0 Our dogs love all those smells, an=
d again: Welcome to secondary.<br><br>4: If you ship more than an ounce of=
 anything, it will more likely get through if you make it look like a care=
 package from family.=C2=A0 Handwritten address, full return addresses, and=
 neat careful tape jobs with your product safetly placed in some more innoc=
uous container.<br><br>5:Powders andd pills leave a very distinct outline=
 on the outside of plain envelopes. Buy those cheap leather single credit=
 card holders and put them in something like that. We see packages all the=
 time with 20-30 little round punch-out looking holes in plain white envelo=
pes.=C2=A0 Welcome to secondary.<br><br>6: Watch countries.=C2=A0 =C2=A0The=
se countries are updated monthly, but the following are a giant red flag an=
d no matter how pretty the package, it's getting a second look:=C2=A0 Pakis=
tan, India, Netherlands, Greece, Afghanistan, Columbia, Panama, Portugal,=
 Serbia, Croatia.=C2=A0 Use- re-mailers, try to get your packages sent from=
 anywhere in the UK (with the exception of Northern Ireland).=C2=A0 Italy=
 comes and goes as a red-flag origin, but is usually safe.=C2=A0 If you mis=
t ship from these countries, ship small letter shaped/sized documents, post=
cards are best.<br><br>7: DO NOT SHIP LIQUIDS. I repeat, DO NOT SHIP liquid=
s.=C2=A0 They break, they leak, they condensate, they swish when you move=
 them.=C2=A0 We have a weight scale that rolls suspicious packages at 1.5Gs=
 RMS and it tells us immediately if there is liquid in the package.<br><br>=
8: Use exact postage.=C2=A0 It seems strange, but illicits usually over-pos=
tage their packs, apparently Ted Kaszinski did this too.. odd.<br><br>So th=
ose are your biggest hurdles shipping internationally into Canada.=C2=A0 If=
 you do it smartly, aren't overzealous, split your large shipments and avoi=
d Montreal, Cornwall, and Vancouver=C2=A0 clearing houses, I'd say you have=
 a=C2=A0 better than 90% chance of getting your product through un-molested=
.<br><br>Out.<br>

r>There was also a postal intern that posted here saying that handwritten=
 packages are more likely to be screened.<br><br>So its hard to know which=
 is the better info. <br><br>But basically, I cannot possibly imagine that=
 hand written packages are better. Here's why... It can't possibly be a thi=
ng of suspicion to notice a professional looking package with a printed lab=
el. No postal officer is going to say "printed label, well packaged - this=
 seems suspicious" - simply because, if you've ever ordered anything from=
 amazon/internet you would know that this is how 99% of packages arrive any=
way.<br><br>But a handwritten package? That instantly shows you that it is=
 unlikely to have come from a corporate source. Therefore it is either a fa=
mily thing/a small time company/possible suspicious package.<br><br>Whereas=
 a normal printed label package, is exactly the same as 99% of all the othe=
r corporate post there. Why would you write a handwritten address to make=
 it look like a care package, when a printed address will make it look like=
 99% of all other business post?<br><br>I am weary of people celebrating an=
ything written here from "LE" as instantly true. For all we know this guy=
 could just be sewing disinformation. Not making any accusations but we sho=
uldn't rule it out.<br><br>Vendors right now aren't having any trouble usin=
g printed labels. Over 99% of everything gets through and the ones that don=
't are typically either due to scammers lying/packages from dodgy countries=
/flukes. If people start reporting that their shit is getting seized more=
 then maybe we'd have to look at the protocol but right now it seems like=
 the conventional wisdom of printed labels being better stands up to the re=
al world evidence.<br><br>

				BTW you should try kratom. It is cross-tolerant with opioid and is cons=
