				Hey, I just wanted to share my recent experience with AAkoven and preve=
nt the same from happening to others.<br><br>I knew AAkoven was a top vendo=
r (98 rating) so I figured ordering speed from him would be pretty safe, bu=
t I ordered almost 2 months ago and have nothing to show for it.=C2=A0 Perh=
aps the problem does not lie with him, as most people are satisfied with hi=
s stuff, but rather with the reshipper.=C2=A0 His impossible-to-understand=
 messages did not help his case, though.<br>My full conversation transcript=
 will be included in the next post.<br><br>First off, I was a little worrie=
d when I noticed (after I ordered) that his listing said "i ship not usa,"=
 so I messaged him about canceling the order but he said he had already shi=
pped it.=C2=A0 <br><br>After waiting patiently for 20 days, nothing had arr=
ived so I asked for a reship.=C2=A0 He offered 50%, which is less than most=
 vendors but fair enough.=C2=A0 While waiting for the reship I did a little=
 research and found out that many people had qualms about his packaging:<br=
><br>"i couldn't believe it, that the customs didn't recognize what was ins=
ide... you could smell the reek of the phet from one meter distance through=
 the packaging"<br>http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3D4750.285=
<br><br>"the package was basically pills wrapped in newspaper and then pack=
aged, no vacuum pack, nothing."<br>http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?=
topic=3D19561.0<br><br>"I've got a friend who was fucked in USA cause of aa=
kovens packaging... knock and talk and shit for a couple pills...."<br>http=
://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3D19561.msg200169#msg200169<br><b=
r><br>22 days after reshipping, I still have nothing.=C2=A0 Obviously I was=
 a little irked.=C2=A0 I've had dozens of packages arrive from Europe (cohe=
rence, blaatzor, amsterdope, juergen, etc) on the first time.=C2=A0 No way=
 2 shipments get intercepted for no reason--I'm guessing it was the packagi=
ng issues mentioned.<br><br>I brought this up to AA and asked for a refund=
 (not full refund, obviously) but he sent back messages that made no sense=
 and ultimately refused to refund.=C2=A0 <br><br>So far, from my point of=
 view this was a terrible buyer's experience.=C2=A0 I paid in full, ended=
 up with nothing, and had to deal with nonsensical messages and cryptic cus=
tomer service.<br><br>Just wanted to warn people.=C2=A0 If you're in the UK=
 this most likely does not apply but you will still have to wade through hi=
s broken English.<br><br>I'll update if either of the packages end up comin=
g through.

				God damnit, I wish I didn't see this... Its been 17 days and still am=
 waiting for me package. AAkoven also told me that his reshipper had some=
 sort of Hard Drive crash which is why it's taking sooo long.<br><br>AAkove=
n keeps reassuring me though, that my package is going to come... each time=
 saying that it's going to be an extra day. I also agree with you that this=
 experience as a buyer is just terrible.<br><br>I've been financing my mone=
y the past few weeks assuming that my bulk order would arrive by now, I'm=
 broke as fuck now and dope sick. I had to pawn my $3000 saxophone and vari=
ous other things to not be sick this past week. I was really counting on aa=
koven's OC 40's to be here by now.<br><br><br>After reading this thread tho=
ugh, you finalized it for me- the fact that my package isn't going to make=
 it. I really can't go on just waiting for the mail to come only to find no=
thing. It's such a fucking tease, that it's almost better knowing that my=
 package aint going to be here versus wondering if its coming today.<br><br=
><br>I honestly would rather have AAkoven tell me that my package isn't goi=
ng to make it. Rather than saying "oh dude relax, itll be there... 2 or 3=
 days give it"=20

				hey, so the mail man just dropped off the mail and guess what? I still=
 haven't gotten my package which was guaranteed to be here yesterday or tod=
ay. <br><br>3 days ago he AAkoven said yea 2-3 days should be there.... the=
n 7 days ago he says oh yea 4-6 days should be there...<br><br>Then all of=
 a sudden his reshipper has a Hard drive crash breaks his computer...... Ok=
ay, so that will add a few days onto the wait time, but why AAkoven would=
 you tell me this after resolution?? I mean, if your reshipper has a comput=
er crash or whatever, don't you think that you should have told me this ear=
lier when you found out?<br><br>I'm not insulting or being unnecessary mean=
, I'm being honest and giving you constructive criticism for your business.=
 And right now, I regret spending the $1000 for 50 OC 40 mg's. I'm actually=
 very disapointed and unsatisfied with the turnout of this transaction so=
 far. I won't be back and wish I didn't deal with him in the first place.<b=
r><br>Maybe I'm being a little harsh on aakoven but $1000 is allot for me=
 and I've been -$1000 for 17 days... I owe people money now. WTF am i going=
 to do?

				One of the very first things I learned about the Silk Road based on my=
 lurking in the forums for about a month was that you NEVER order from the=
 Netherlands if you are in the U.S. It is not worth the risk whatsoever. Th=
e Netherlands is an automatically flagged country and the chance of that pa=
ckage getting to you is significantly diminished. I doubt this is all AAkov=
en's fault. Maybe he should have used better packaging, but the fact is tha=
t the Netherlands are already a poor choice to order from. Unfortunately yo=
u had to find this out the hard way. But at least you know for the future.

 to be honest, I have already given up hope that I'll get either one of tho=

				I'm in Australia and have ordered from AA without any problems at all.=
 I know it's not the US, but it's a very long way to send something. I got=
 my goods in 12 days (including weekends) and had no problems with communic=

 Ask for a tracking number if you want to know where your package is at all=
 times. If you are afraid of losing a package then ask vendor to ship in 3-=
4 separate packages over the course of a few days and pay a little extra sh=
ipping. Order from more than one vendor. Basically, don't put all your eggs=

ke 50% of the risk. It would have been smarter to get a 50% refund and buy=
 from another seller if you were unhappy with AA's packaging, his english=
 and anything else. <br><br>Drugs are still illegal. That means that no mat=
ter where you source them from, there is a risk involved. <br><br>I'm a 10+=
 year IV H user, i know that sometimes the drugs can try and own you. You=
 have to be patient AND smart when using.=C2=A0 Don't spend more than you=
 can afford to potentially lose. If you are buying for other people, make=
 sure they understand the risk of mail order drugs. If they don't, point th=

 him to the US for at least 6 months and haven't lost a single one. Maybe=
 I'm lucky but he's definitely one of the most consistent sellers here. You=

				AAkoven is right when he says that sr is diffrent now. i remember when=
 i joined 7 months ago people acted way different . there was a sense of lo=
ve here, and understanding. when im ordering from the netherlands and it do=
esnt arrive i eat the loss. these arent street dealers. if a package doesnt=
 arrive they have to pay for it too. its ridiculous how some people act her=
e now, leaving 3/5 feedback for crushed pills... and crucifying vendors whe=
n something goes wrong, its the buyers responsibility to be smart and choos=
e wisely who they order from. at this rate sr will fall apart. there are a=
 ridiculous amount of assholes here who take for granted the service they=
 are getting. I live in the USA and here the best ecstasy pills have maybe=
 60mg of mdma in them.. and "molly" is just a bunch of "roll like" rcs. i=
 for one greatly appreciate the service that is given to me here, and the=
 chance to indulge in some of the best quality drugs from all over the worl=
d. On another note i ordered 10 grams of mdma from aakoven and it arrived=
 here in 10 days...Do you know how many scammers he has to deal with every=
 day with his level of transactions? im sure its very hard to differentiate=
 between whos a scam buyer and whos not. hes an awesome dude and there is=
 no reason to slander him here just because you had a few issues. and after=
 a package didnt arrive you ordered it to the same address? thats your bad.=
 if you feel so strongly about this leave silk road and never come back. ju=
st my opinion... i dont mean any offense.=20

				Well as a new member to the forum I'm sure my post will be taken lightl=
y but I've just received an order (west coast) from AA in under a week incl=
uding Sunday =3D] <br><br>there is one thing I noticed (and I don't want an=
ybody to take this an accusation but rather an observation) there is no tra=
cking. And this leaves me believe there is a wide open window for people to=
 claim no shows on packages. Again I'm not saying this is what happens but=
 its a huge possibilty. I can easily see how one could exploit that. <br><b=

h blah I already hear you shut your fucking mouth)<br><br>Also, you keep fa=
iling to notice this dinstinction Aakoven, so perhaps I'll hammer it home=
 one more fucking time for you. You ready? Get google translate up if you=
 need it. Get your hearing aid, pull the strap-on out of your ass, wipe Nor=
iegas lips clean, and pay fucking attention. Why is it that out of all the=
 Dutch vendors, you and Noriega have the most US seizures? <br><br>Why do=
 I not see the same complaints about chemical brothers, or skyy, or halpern=
, or one of the MYRIAD of dutch vendors, using exactly the same postal serv=
ice as you?<br><br>So yes, you don't need to repeat for the 15 fucking mill=
ionth time that "if you send out a lot of orders, some get seized". Yes Aak=
oven, some get seized. Some get seized, and noone tells you about it. Some=
 get seized, and you get a customs letter. <br><br>Yet with your and Norieg=
a's seizures, NO-ONE has received a customs letter?<br><br>"Oh well sometim=
es customs doesn't contact you"<br><br>Yes, thank you for stating the obvio=
us there, but why has NO-ONE received a customs letter with one of your sei=
zures? Literally fucking noone at all, and I've been following all these th=
reads, and your feedback, as Noriega's, and the rest of the dutch vendors=
 like a fucking HAWK.<br><br>I don't deny that you do many legit transactio=
ns, and I suspect now that you know people suspect you that you will be com=
ing through with all your US orders and we will be hearing about it on the=
 forums, and suddenly everything is fine.<br><br>But you can't pull the woo=
l over a fucking hawk's eyes, and I'd bet my summer drug stash on the fact=
 that you and your buddy were selectively scamming the US (you even had it=
 on your vendor profile that US customs had upped their game.. Nicely done=
 there, nice). That is, before Noriega fucked off altogether. Yet I've been=
 paying attention this whole time and watching this situation very closely.=
 <br><br>And one question gives you right the fuck away, and I'll be shocke=
d, but not astounded if you can actually answer it - why was there a spell=
 of time over march-april where your US orders were getting seized at a RID=
ICULOUS rate (much much much much more than the 5% statistic you love to ta=
lk bout), but the other dutch vendors weren't having the same problem?<br><=
br>What was it, was it your packaging? Did your drops get identified? Or di=
d US customs just "up their game" for only you and your pal? Or did you tal=
k to each other and think "hey man we can claim these orders didn't arrive=
 and make an extra 30% markup"? And also, whilst I'm in the business of ask=
ing questions, where the fuck is your pal noriega? You know, the guy you kn=
ow, that owes thousands of dollars to people. I mean it's not a big deal or=
 anything, your connections to a known scammer, not your fault or anything,=
 not your responsibility, yeah. Keep telling us how it's nothing to do with=
 you, you never know, you're probably right. <br><br>Your story is nonsense=
. And I'm not the sort of person to make baseless accusations. So grats to=
 all the people in the US that are now receiving orders, but the damage has=
 already been done.

 people are accusing Aakoven is because he associates with the utter piece=
 of shit scammer Noriega (who still owes many many people product and doesn=
't even have the courtesy to explain himself) in real life and knows him.=
 (oh its not his fault blah blah I already hear you shut your fucking mouth=
)<br><br>Also, you keep failing to notice this dinstinction Aakoven, so per=
haps I'll hammer it home one more fucking time for you. You ready? Get goog=
le translate up if you need it. Get your hearing aid, pull the strap-on out=
 of your ass, wipe Noriegas lips clean, and pay fucking attention. Why is=
 it that out of all the Dutch vendors, you and Noriega have the most US sei=
zures? <br><br>Why do I not see the same complaints about chemical brothers=
, or skyy, or halpern, or one of the MYRIAD of dutch vendors, using exactly=
 the same postal service as you?<br><br>So yes, you don't need to repeat fo=
r the 15 fucking millionth time that "if you send out a lot of orders, some=
 get seized". Yes Aakoven, some get seized. Some get seized, and noone tell=
s you about it. Some get seized, and you get a customs letter. <br><br>Yet=
 with your and Noriega's seizures, NO-ONE has received a customs letter?<br=
><br>"Oh well sometimes customs doesn't contact you"<br><br>Yes, thank you=
 for stating the obvious there, but why has NO-ONE received a customs lette=
r with one of your seizures? Literally fucking noone at all, and I've been=
 following all these threads, and your feedback, as Noriega's, and the rest=
 of the dutch vendors like a fucking HAWK.<br><br>I don't deny that you do=
 many legit transactions, and I suspect now that you know people suspect yo=
u that you will be coming through with all your US orders and we will be he=
aring about it on the forums, and suddenly everything is fine.<br><br>But=
 you can't pull the wool over a fucking hawk's eyes, and I'd bet my summer=
 drug stash on the fact that you and your buddy were selectively scamming=
 the US (you even had it on your vendor profile that US customs had upped=
 their game.. Nicely done there, nice). That is, before Noriega fucked off=
 altogether. Yet I've been paying attention this whole time and watching th=
is situation very closely. <br><br>And one question gives you right the fuc=
k away, and I'll be shocked, but not astounded if you can actually answer=
 it - why was there a spell of time over march-april where your US orders=
 were getting seized at a RIDICULOUS rate (much much much much more than th=
e 5% statistic you love to talk bout), but the other dutch vendors weren't=
 having the same problem?<br><br>What was it, was it your packaging? Did yo=
ur drops get identified? Or did US customs just "up their game" for only yo=
u and your pal? Or did you talk to each other and think "hey man we can cla=
im these orders didn't arrive and make an extra 30% markup"? And also, whil=
st I'm in the business of asking questions, where the fuck is your pal nori=
ega? You know, the guy you know, that owes thousands of dollars to people.=
 I mean it's not a big deal or anything, your connections to a known scamme=
r, not your fault or anything, not your responsibility, yeah. Keep telling=
 us how it's nothing to do with you, you never know, you're probably right.=
 <br><br>Your story is nonsense. And I'm not the sort of person to make bas=
eless accusations. So grats to all the people in the US that are now receiv=
ing orders, but the damage has already been done.<br></blockquote><div clas=

 today 25 days later. He told me there were some mail delays during that ti=
me but I really thought it wasn't going to come through. VERY pleasant surp=

				You people need to wake the fuck up.. Actual elite and loyal vendors he=
re dont have this kind of controversy surrounding there names in the forums=
!!! It blows my mind how he is still referred to as a trusted seller. Just=
 because some idiots received there packages and enjoy getting buttfucked=
 by AA's scams doesnt make him reputable.=C2=A0 But i guess when you make=
 everyone FE it is pretty easy to slide by on false accomplishments. Please=
 smarten up people!! Putting 5/5 when you finalize early only targets you=
 for SELECTIVE scammers such as AA, and only encourages vendors like this=
 to make it a policy so that they can easily ship out FAKE product and act=
 like they were none the wiser that there product is pure shitttt, and that=
s if they even ship your order at all.. If it doesnt arrive, 90% chance the=
y didnt send it at all. And why would they "reship" if they didnt send it=
 the first time. And then your trapped in their 50% Refund bullshit. How do=
 you people explain his enormously higher rate for non received pckges than=
 other NL vendors who use the same mailing system and have 99% delivery rat=
e???<br><br>AA is by far the worst vendor I have ever had the misfortune of=
 working with. It doesnt take much searching in the forums to find that AA=
 fails to meet the standards of a Loyal vendor when it comes to PRODUCT, CO=
MMUNICATION, RESOLUTION, or even simple RESPECT. His speed is complete garb=
age( maybe get 20% actual product if lucky) and his ketamine was a COMPLETE=
 JOKE!! I did my full gram in one night just to see how bullshit it really=
 was, and let me tell you it was pretty clear there was 0% ket in there!!!=
 On top of scamming his costumers by sending them fake product, when confro=
nted with this information he acts like we are high school druggies that wo=
uldnt and couldnt know better. He treats his costumers with blatant disresp=
ect by acting like we are uninformed and dont know anything on the drugs we=
 choose to take. And continues to make an even bigger piece of shit of hims=
elf by pretending he doesnt have knowledge of the quality of his own produc=
ts. He even admits to getting scammed by his dealers!! Which means he was=
 in full knowledge when he passed on the scam to his buyers!!<br><br>If eve=
r confronted on any of this nonsense his english returns to a toddler level=
 and you will have no luck getting a reasonable or respecfull response. He=
 is absolutely spineless and spits in all of your faces with with his decei=
tful bullshit.<br><br>BEWARE buyers(especially US) This one is not to be tr=

				I'm from the East U.S and I have ordered from AAkoven at least 5 times.=
 I have received all of my orders from him except for one. The reason I'm=
 certain I didn't get it is because I sent it to someone's house and addres=
sed it with a name that didn't live there. Ever since I have been putting=
 the real address with the owners name I have had no problems. The first 3=
 packages I received were perfectly packed and he used an ironed bag. Two=
 of them were directly from the NL as well. The last one I received was re-=
shipped from the UK to make it less suspicious. I noticed though when I rec=
eived it the packaging was sub-par. It was only in a baggy with newspaper=
 in the letter. I'm glad I got it but if I had known it was sent like that=
 I would have been nervous. I have a feeling that it might not be AAkoven's=
 fault as much as the person re-shipping it. I have since talked to him and=
 he said that he does not re-ship anymore, hopefully for that reason but I=
 do not know. If you have any similar stories please share with the forum=
 so we can get a better idea on what is going on! <br><br>Thanks guys!=20

				Well I can't say that I'm glad I started reading this post...<br><br>I=
 recognize that I am a new buyer/poster, I have not had much reason for pos=
ting until this but have spent several hours browsing the forums.<br><br>So=
 I made my first order on the 7th, almost 3 weeks ago from one of the oldes=
t and most "trusted" vendors on SR for MDMA, Aakoven. I ordered 1 gram, fin=
alized early per his request, and waited anxiously by my mailbox in western=
 US. I remember before ordering that I checked to see that there was at lea=
st some form of refund policy and it stated that 50% refund is the most giv=
en, which is understandable for me I have no problem splitting the loss in=
 case of one. I understand the NL is a high profile country for the post an=
d shit gets picked up from there more often than most.<br><br>After the pac=
kage had not arrived by this Monday, I decided to let the vendor know and=
 voice my concern, as politely as possible, that it might never come. He ad=
vised me if it doesn't come in by Friday the 26th it probably won't. In the=
 unfortunate circumstance that my package didn't show up I asked what kind=
 of recourse he could offer me, i.e some sort of refund or resend. He quick=
ly instructed me "check my profile". I go to look and now it appears that=
 his refund policy has changed and will offer no sort of refund to US custo=
mers. I am now waiting a reply to my request of a 50% refund.<br><br>I am=
 still hopeful that the product will arrive and I make no judgement concern=
ing the vendor Aakoven yet. However, should it not arrive and the vendor st=
ops communication and doesn't offer any kind of refund, I can't help but fe=
el like a scammed first time buyer. Would it be offensive to suggest that=
 some particularly reputable vendors take advantage of first time buyers by=
 directing them to finalize early? I have another order in transit for LSD=
 from new seller Jannis that I did not have to finalize for and am looking=
 forward to that coming in.<br><br>Does anyone particularly in the U.S. hav=
e any successful experiences with Aakoven as a vendor? I understand how muc=
h work being a large scale vendor on the Road can be, but this amount of un=
delivered orders can't be normal is it?

				I am a new buyer and I orders 200 pills from AAKOVEN about 6 weeks ago.=
 The order totaled $1200.00. I know that you should not FE and I did not wa=
nt to! I requested to have my auto-finalize date extended through the resol=
ution center because I hadn't received anything yet and he messaged me aski=
ng me to finalize because I am a new buyer. I saw his rating was pretty hig=
h and I trusted that he had sent them so STUPIDLY I finalized! This was the=
 biggest mistake I have made in a long time.<br><br>I borrowed the $1200.00=
 from someone so that I could get this venture going so I could start makin=
g money off importing these pills. After 6 weeks I have received NOTHING!=
 He told me that he would send in two separate envelopes and neither have=
 arrived. I also orders 1g cocaine and 10 LSD blotters on the same day that=
 I orders the pills and both of those arrived after 3 weeks. They were both=
 waiting in my post box together. I do not believe that both packages were=
 stolen because that is just unfuckingbelievable! What are the chances that=
 both packages from the same vendor get stolen and everything makes it thro=
ugh fine? Absolute bullfuckingshit!!!!<br><br>I'm now sitting with a $1200.=
00 debt and I know that he fucked me over on this order! But what I don't=
 understand is why he would rip off someone who is making such a big order?=
 Clearly I was going to be a good customer but now that he butt-fucked me=
 I will most definitely not be doing business with him again and I recommen=
d that no else should either! If you do - STAY IN ESCROW!!!!<br><br>Through=
 my communication with him, he didn't even know where the fuck I was from,=
 after telling him TWICE before he still got it wrong, TWICE! Thought I was=
 from two different countries. I know he never sent them, just pocketed my=
 cash! He also told me that he will send me 10 pills as a tester to see if=
 they make it - I guarantee you they will get "stolen" again! He never fuck=
ing sent these ones either! Bet your fucking ass-off!!! Besides, like 10 wi=
ll make up for the $1200.00 loss I've now got!<br><br>FUCK AAKOVEN! I will=
 be much better off buying from someone else like SKYY in future! If this=
 was real-world I'd cut his fucking nuts off for this amount of money!!!<br=
><br>Anyway, I've accepted after 6 weeks of anxiously waiting that they wil=
l not be coming so now I'm just out to warn everyone about this fuck-tard!!=
!!<br><br>My order of $1200.00 should also impact his rating greatly, pitty=
 it was a custom listing so no one will be able to see my review!

				I hear yah guys same thing happened to me when i was new, saw aakoven's=
 cheap prices and outlandish claims about his narcotics then took it at fac=
e value, blindly trusted him and FE. 3 seperate packages were meant to have=
 been sent, 2 G Speed (x2) and 5G Speed (x1).<br><br>=C2=A0I first made the=
 order of the 5G and 2G at the time, i was hoping to make some fast cash fo=
r a developing opiate problem =3D/. Neither showed up and looking back i do=
n't know why i did it (live and learn i guess) Anyway when i told him and=
 pretty much was like What Now? He told me he would resend The 2G package=
 then asked for my address, about 3 months (i reckon it was more like 1-2=
 months) later i received a love letter saying 2G of unidentified powder ha=
d been seized.<br><br>Now first, you think aussie customs would know wtf sp=
eed looks like, especially if it was as good as this guy is claiming. I've=
 seen other love letters and they list what they believe the product to be,=
=C2=A0 the guys who caught mine obviously had no fucking idea what it was.=
 After research i learnt that its basically caffiene with little to no spee=
d in it anyway, now i understand exaggeration and how its used in marketing=
. But Caffeine? comon that's false advertising, your setting yourself up fo=
r a beating. Hell where i live people get stabbed with dirty fits for a hit=
, if he tried that in person he'd be fucking dead (i wouldn't do such a thi=
ng for speed, but these crazy crackheads...). People shoot this shit up you=
 fucking psycho! I admit it's stupid to shoot up, but i think it's arrogant=
 to give them dangerous drugs and expect them to conform to you ROA, its th=
ere fucking choice and if your speed is too shit to IV then fucking put it=
 in the listing.<br><br>But ofcourse the real mystery is why would customs=
 only pick up one of three packages? Aussie customs ain't what its cracked=
 up to be, i guess we just have a shit load of sniffer dogs (our countries=
 like a huge fucking backyard in some ways). Furthermore if they picked up=
 3 packages with the same name i think that would have been in the letter,=
 especially if they had been sent earlier =3D/.<br><br>Now i don't really=
 care anymore and i'm thankful that it happened early and in hindsight i on=
ly trusted him because speed is fucking expensive where i live (250 for any=
thing remotely okay), and i was expecting medium purity around 50-60%, so=
 the good deal made me jump like every desperate junkie does when they see=
 money. And i saw fat fucking dolla bills i can tell you. Oh and newbies,=
 the first 5 things i ordered never came. Relax, always use the forums and=
 if shit goes south. Well never invest what you can't afford, i know sucks=
 but better to learn sooner than later. Yeh i spent about $250 before i lea=
rned my lesson, but that was partly fucking Noriega disappearing act, manag=
ed to order just before people realized he'd fucked off and i had already=
 FE....<br><br>I learned eventually, doesn't matter which country you go to=
... Most of the time Its the criminals selling drugs or its the fuckwit wit=
h a habit and It's very rarely someone who has a business ethic. But we are=
 lucky enough to have some good uns here on SR, i won't mention any for fea=
r that putting them in this thread will make people think that I'm advertis=
ing for them, maybe i am, but thats how a lot of good business is run you=
 have to remember; "word of mouth". If people like what your doing they'll=
 shout it from the rooftops. <br><br>Anyway AA i'll leave the 5 i gave you,=
 no point taking it back now and its no longer listed seeing as all my succ=
essful orders seem to have pushed it off screen, whats one opinion in a sea=
 of FE anyway? I dunno if you did scam me but it is quite suspicious, but=
 then again who knows. Either way your getting plenty of business and i don=
't buy from you. Plus simple solution if your listening, don't sell to Aust=
ralian or US customers, you are obviously too shit to package things proper=
ly for us. <br><br>Yeh i know flagged country, thats a fucking excuse and=
 a half. Also your the only Netherlands vendor to be this notorious, i gues=
s that means your also the shittest. I'm being way to offensive for my own=
 good hear but ripping off a nice near-junkie(no offense, playful term wher=
e I'm from) like that $1200? If you can't confirm 100% on bulk then don't=
 do bulk, this ain't a game, this is peoples lives your screwing up. For mo=
ney talk about petty mate.<br><br>Oh and i recommend ignoring me AAkoVen,=
 i'm withdrawing like nothing else right now. I'm sure to within Europe peo=
ple appreciate your service and will for months coming, just don't bother=
 with AUS and US anymore please or at least AUS double Please. We only Wing=
e and bitch anyway, well thats what your opinion of us seems to be anyway.=
 <br><br>Although I've gotten ripped off with street drugs plenty of times=
 and in those situations i was not offered a 50% refund for the bunk shit=
 i received. <br><br>P.S. Ofcourse he has good MDMA guys, his in the fuckin=
g Netherlands, he would have to have crippling brain damage to get burnt bu=
ying mandy over there. Or be cutting it himself, but i doubt that. I think=
 the speed is probably bunk like the K is. I wouldn't get anything but MDMA=
 off him personally and i hate the shit so extra reasons to not bother!<br>

				okay perhaps 100% is a little high, but most good vendors state that bu=

 really not that hard either, if you don't have any ideas order from a vend=

				So um.. I'm not sure what you guys are doing wrong but I highly doubt=
 AA is a scammer. I have sent him well over 5k (FE, too) and received every=
thing perfectly. Printed labels, vac-seal etc. Some of his products might=

u're ordering controlled substances in the mail from an extremely high-risk=
 country you shouldn't immediately scream "SCAMMER SCAMMER" when it doesn't=
 arrive. Believe it or not, smuggling drugs is illegal...<br><br>Also, to=

nteed to buy at least 200 a week from you (and im expanding so it would be=
 a lot more in the next month or two), so really, you only fucked yourself=
 over, by making sure I never buy from your sorry ass again! I actually hav=
en't lost out, I worked a deal with another dealer here on the road for 50=
 pills and I'll start from there, again, like I have done before! Turns out=
 they're a lot cheaper than you as well! $3.80 each! So now im scoring more=
 profit in the end, thanks!<br><br>CUNT<br><br>Me: Oh, and by the way, I gu=
arantee that those other 10 aren't coming either. Once again you didn't sen=
d them! This will be your cover-up, because these once will get "stolen" ag=
ain. Funny though, I bought another two products same time as yours, also=
 from NL, both of them arrived quite fine, so don't fucking bullshit me abo=
ut this, I know you never fucking sent them!<br><br>Yes, rather stop talkin=
g you dishonest little fuck-face!<br><br>Me: Yeah, and considering that I=
 am the only E dealer in town, I would know if anyone else had them!<br><br=
>aakoven(91): lol, u show your true colors .<br><br>go for it , many sad th=
at before ..<br><br>U are a dumb cunt..Fact have a great weekend...looser.<=

 now..an done talking...stupid fuck..<br><br>Me: You're the asshole here!=
 Not me! Did I rip anyone off? NO! YOU DID! You and I both know very well=
 that you never sent me those parcels. Like I said, the chances of both fro=
m you happen to get "stolen". I'm not a fucking retard! I see many posts on=
 the forums about you selective scamming people so I'm not the only one! An=
d clearly your rating is starting to show it too! Enjoy my 1 you fucking pr=
ick! You won't be able to do this for much longer! I'm going to do anything=
 and everything I can to make sure you can't do this to anyone else! If it=
 means sending a PM to each and every person Silk Road I'll do that - thats=

br>aakoven(91): wait on the pills to come plz..<br><br>Me: Hi, could you at=
 least do a 50% refund so I can at least regain some of my loss. Please, at=
 least this will get me in the clear. I will really appreciate it and will=
 let everyone know that you help me out immensely! Thanks in advance AA!<br=
><br>aakoven(91): i will give u...25 % back..as i also sen u some pills aga=
in.!!<br><br><br>am sorry m8...<br><br>Me: Listen mate, could I just get a=
 refund. I don't want to risk loosing more than I already have. I just want=
 my money back so I'm not in shit with the diamond dealers that I borrowed=
 the cash from. I know it's not in your terms and conditions but you make=
 a lot of cash i'm sure so please could you help me out on this buddy! Plea=
se! I'm in so much shit here you don't even understand. The average salary=
 here is $200 just to show you how much $1200.00 really is here, that's 6=
 months of my salary and I've just gotten off the phone with these guys and=
 they're not happy with me. I thought everything would work out and now it=
 hasn't so I'm really fucked here unless you can help me. Please AA! I'm be=
gging you!!!<br><br>aakoven(91): let me know wen they arrive<br><br>Me: I=
 will let you know if they arrive anytime from now but it's not looking goo=
d, it's taken far too long for me to even keep some hope of them arriving..=
.<br><br>Me: Thats the thing, I don't believe that anyone has stolen them.=
 Everything else came through fine except those two packages which were sen=
t on different days so it doesn't make sense that both packages got stolen=
 from you?<br><br>aakoven(91): take it step by step...if u tell me Who stol=
e them...?<br><br>i can send again, but on your end , someone steal your pi=
lls buddy<br><br>Me: Okay so if I get the test will you send me more? At le=
ast if I can get 100 then I can make enough money to pay the guy back that=
 I borrowed from and I will be bale to buy another 200 from you so I can ke=
ep in business, with only 10 I can make $350 so that wont be enough to plac=
e another order or to pay the guy back... Please help me on this one mate!<=
br><br>aakoven(91): i have send a test..as all was Stolen.!!!<br>u think I=
 want to send again..before i don,t know it arrive..<br>Its not customs ..w=
ho fought them m8 <br><br>Me: Okay so how many will you be sending this tim=
e? I am at a huge loss here! Even if I get 10 it's not going to make up for=
 the 1200 that i spent. I cannot loose all this money. If you can send me=
 those 200 I will definitely be back, you may not make money from this lot=
 but neither will I if you don't help me out which means then that I will=
 not have more money to buy more from you in future. At least if I get thes=
e I will make some money and will buy more from you, even more than last ti=
me! Please help me out on this one. What can we do here?<br><br>aakoven(91)=
: U ask me last time 2x100 so i did......<br><br>lets try this.......<br><b=
r>AA <br><br>Me: No I am the one from *****. Did you send two packages each=
 with 100 to *****? Maybe someone is stealing but like I said everything el=
se has made it through fine so far. My address is:<br><br>*********<br>****=

. I borrowed cash because I am bringing them in for someone who is going to=
 re-sell them and I am making some money from it too but I didn't have cash=
 to get started so I borrowed money from an illegal diamond dealer to get=
 me started.<br><br>Is there anything we can do here to sort something out=
 because I'm in big shit if I don't get anything! Please! I will be a retur=

 out when I placed the order? It has been well over a month and no sign of=
 anything... I'm just trying to keep my hopes up here because im going to=
 be in a lot of shit if they don't arrive. I borrowed this money from someo=

				past 3 products recieved have been bunk. my mistake as I hadn't taken=
