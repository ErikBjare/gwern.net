				Placed an order for 25g of SDM's bubble hash on Sunday and got it on We=
dnesday. This was from his "bad batch" that people have been complaining ab=
out, yet I cannot complain. While it may not be as amazing as his other bat=
ches (this going off what I've heard only), it is still damn good hash, esp=
ecially for the price. I actually received over an ounce (weighed out to ar=
ound 32 grams). The packaging was stealthy and there was absolutely no smel=
l. The high is nice and clean and... yeah I'm too baked now to go into much=
 detail. His reputation speaks for itself; SDM is the man to go to for dank=
 hash. I'll be back for more, thanks!

				I was one of SDmans first sales awhile back and have continued purchasi=
ng using BTC and eventually just sending cash through the mail. He is the=
 best vendor with the best product for the best price on the road hands dow=
n. Give him a try and you wont be sad you did. What ohmygawd said is true=
 as well, i literally have no need to browse the road anymore. SDman is als=
o the only vendor that im not constantly checking the tracking and what not=
, very trustworthy and reputable.

 at the picture you posted vinnyg and that stuff is not very good looking=

				SDM is a cool dude. I remember when I saw he first came on, I missed ou=

 said, he of THE BEST SR vendors out there, i said it; THE BEST. I can't wa=

				Sourdieselman is fucking awesome! More than 7g overweight!! Holy shit.<=
br>Shipped tues. arrived thurs. FAST AS HELL<br>The hash is already pretty=
 damn good, not to mention the price he sells it for. White ash, catches fi=
re, and melts in a bowl, this shit is great. Tastes good and gets you high=
 as fuck.<br><br>STORY: My buddy and I packed one 1.5g bowl of this hash th=
e day we got it in my bong. We smoked it all in one night, and we agreed th=
at it was the highest we ever were in our lives. The next day we got more=
 hash and packed my friends little pipe. We could only finish just over a=
 half gram when we were baked and had to drive. The half gram lasted foreve=
r in the bowl, and we took tons of fat rips by turning it over. Then when=
 we got to my house my buddy had an idea. He went upstairs saw my bong, and=
 showed me i was a total idiot. There was at least a good 0.5g left at the=
 bottom of the bong. The shit cherried like crazy and it lasted so long tha=
t we had no idea there was more. It looked like all ash, but under the blac=
k carpet laid even more hash. We smoked the rest and needless to say I felt=
 like I was even higher than I was the other night.<br><br>Thanks SDM for=
 the two highest nights of my life haha

				Before you read my review. Please note that my first order was about a=
 month ago, and my most recent about a week ago, and is from the supposedly=
 "bad" batch. Rotten lunch meat? WTF? Not mine. My nose works and it has de=
tected no scent of flesh...???<br><br>I've had 2 orders with Sourdieselman=
 and both have been totally flawless. The only difference I noticed with th=
is batch is that it was a bit wet and some of the keif rubbed off on the pa=
ckage. That meant the hash was mushier and moldable, however the quality fo=
r me is either the same or better, but definitely not worse.<br><br>=C2=A0T=
hat's why I responded that way Vinny, plus you don't know how to upload pic=
tures to the onion uploader so naturally I'm sketpical of anything you say=
 about a quality vendor.<br><br>5/5 for SDM and I highly recommend his HIGH=
 QUALITY products. Seriously, this is the highest potency hash, or cannabis=
 produuct, period, that I've ever had.<br><br>Can't wait to get more of SDM=
's amazing cannabis products!!<br><br>

				Yeah the batch of hash he sent me seemed a bit out of character from wh=
at I've established. I've let it dry out a bit and it seems to have improve=
d a little quality wise. I feel bad for making as much noise as I did. He=
 sent my order the same day he made an update on his profile about quality=
 and I felt as if he was trying to pawn his lower grade on me or something.=
 I'm pretty sure he's somewhat pissed at me at the moment, and I apologize=
 for being rude and accusatory. Sourdieselman took care of the issue profes=
sionally and respectfully and I am now satisfied. I might have to shoot him=
 a PM sometime about some of his herbs if he'll still do business with me.=
 I wouldn't have an issue going out of escrow considering the circumstances=
, his stats, and the fact people send him decent sized amounts of cash in=
 the mail. <br><br>I would recommend Sourdieselman. He is a gentleman and=
 a scholar.=20

				Must have gotten one of the bad batches,=C2=A0 VERY DISAPPOINTED with=
 what was received.=C2=A0 I have taken my time to think about this review,=
 as i've had it for 5 days now.<br><br>This was a very crumbly kief, and ce=
rtainly had no bubble to it.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I'm very experienced with hash on=
 SR, so here are some details on this:<br><br>It broke apart very easily.=
 Just a little pressure would cause it to crumble to powder.=C2=A0 It was=
 very green (not blonde), and looked nothing like the picture in the listin=
g (which looks like hash).=C2=A0 It barely caught flame and would extinguis=
h itself as soon as the flame was moved away.=C2=A0 The ash left behind is=
 dark grey.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 This all tells me that there was A LOT of plant ma=
tter in this.=C2=A0 This might have been made with a bubble bag, but it doe=
s not deserve to be called bubble hash.=C2=A0 It smells nice, and obviously=
 came from a nice strain, but it was made from the lowest quality parts of=
 it.=C2=A0 "Trash into cash" as the phrase goes. I've had Christy Nugs=C2=
=A0 Blue Dream "trim hash" and her stuff was WAY STRONGER and lasted longer=
.<br><br>Good hash should catch flame quickly and stay lit. True full melt=
 bubble hash will sometimes have to be extinguished if a flame is near it=
 too long or if the skillet is too hot.=C2=A0 The ash should be very white=
 to non existent for true, full melt BH.=C2=A0 Good BH also makes me cough=
 my lungs out.=C2=A0 This stuff doesn't really make me cough at all.<br><br=
>EFFECTS:=C2=A0 Upon intake of it by itself, there is an intense high for=
 a few seconds, and then fades away quickly to what I will call an "Empty=
 High."=C2=A0 There is a buzz, but it's not "normal" as some others here ha=
ve described, and it's definitely missing something considering this is fro=
m a Sativa. That "deep in your skull" feeling is not there at all. Even a=
 friend who has tested some of the other Hash offerings from SR, stated the=
y were not impressed by this.=C2=A0 Smoking this straight with a clear head=
 lasted a total of about 50 minutes.<br><br>SERVICE: Shipping quality and=
 delivery time were just fine. I have no complaints there. Also came in jus=
t over 3 grams heavy.<br><br>VALUE: This stuff is cheap, so I'm not trying=
 to complain too much.=C2=A0 I feel I definitely paid retail for the qualit=
y of what was received, even with the bonus amount.=C2=A0 =C2=A0In 5 days=
 time, I've already been through over 8 grams. 7 grams of amateur nugs I ge=
t locally usually lasts me about a week.=C2=A0 The plan was to be able to=
 smoke less of this stuff, not more of it.<br><br>I can't ignore all the ot=
her feedback here about it being "FIRE", "best on SR", etc, but I can hones=
tly say this was not my experience. I really wanted to like this stuff, and=
 was excited the day it came.<br><br>Perhaps SDM has a QC issue?=C2=A0 It=
 was my understanding I ordered after the "bad batch" was gone, and the "is=
sue" that cause it was taken care of. Curious what he has to say.

				So, I'll say this about SDmans hash. I have ordered a total of half a=

 tinted rocks that people have described. Didn't bubble, but I wasn't upset=
 AT ALL with it. For the price, it was a great deal, and the smoke was amaz=
ing.<br><br>Second order: 200g. Ordered 200g a week later. Ordered Thursday=
, recieved monday... ya... Not to mention, this hash was simply amazing. Gr=
eat bubble to the hash, smoked forever, and tatsed amazing. THIS was some=
 top shelf stuff. <br><br>Third order: 200g. Same quick arrival. 4 days hal=
fway across the us. This batch was a mixture of the soft dark and hard rock=
s. This quality was somewhere inbetween the first two orders.<br><br>Overal=
l, the hash is absolutely worth the price, and if the hash becomes consiste=
ntly like the second batch, this shit is a fucking steal!! Can't beat it.=
 Highly recommended.

				Bubble hash by definition bubbles. If it isn't bubble hash then it is=
 "ice water hash". <br><br>Bubble hash is refined hashish that bubbles when=
 smoked. The name was coined by Bubble Man, the Canadian hashish innovator=
 who created a hashish sieving system that uses ice, water and multiple lev=
els of screening in order to remove the resin gland heads from the cannabis=
 plant material, and to further remove any impurities from the hashish leav=
ing a very pure resin. The use of only water and multiple levels of sieving=
 to isolate the concentrated material is ideal for health-conscious consume=
rs and/or medical patients for whom which chemical processing is un-desirab=
le or possibly a health risk. Ice water hash and ice water hash systems wer=
e available, namely from Mila of Amsterdam, but they used a minimal number=
 of screens.

 dude, and need to know every last detail before I go ahead with anything.=

				Just recieved qp of the "indoor and not to happy with product. Just goi=
ng to copy my message i sent to sour cuz i dont feel like retyping all my=
 issues.<br>"Just received my qp of "indoor" chemdawg from you, and its def=
initely not what i was expecting or the "highest quality" it was hyped up=
 to be. Firstoff the smell is just a mild tea smell, definitely not going=
 to impress any of my customers the slightest big, and not "chemmy" at all=
 like the strain would suggest. The nugs are all very dark green and extrem=
ely fluffy, not like any indoor ive ever had. The trim job on alot of the=
 nugs is lacking alot. Sorry to be a pain but it seems like there may have=
 been a mixup possibly? I just got greenhouse from another vendor that had=
 denser, far frostier nugs, and a stronger smell at a price a little cheepe=
r than your "indoor". it just seems to me like its greenhouse or outdoor.=
 Even at your sale price alot of your competition on here has you beet on=
 quality by a big margin. Now im sure you meant no wrong, as other customer=
s writing on the forums who received other strains seem to have gotten a ki=
ller product and are more than happy. Could there possibly have been a mix=
 up? Thanks"

				Yes I really can not tell you what strain you are going to get.=C2=A0=
 If you have a problem with that I am probably not the vendor for you. I bu=

 the best im not that picky about strain. I could be a vendor that tells ev=
eryone exactly what strain they are getting and keeps track of what strain=
 is going to who but I choose not to. That would take me an extra 2-3hrs a=
 day that I would rather not spend working, on top of the other 8-10hrs a=
 day I work.=C2=A0 Masteroffretts I am sorry you were unhappy with your ord=

 I am not the vendor for you. If you are in that 5% which masteroffrets mig=

 a deal for the PRICE. Then again I'm not the type of guy who counts hairs/=

 I would of bought every single gram, and lock it up in my personal stash.=
=C2=A0 <br><br>So someone ask why I kept going with SD, fuck, the guy intro=

 would not have a problem sending funds to SD for coins.=C2=A0 =C2=A0<br><b=

 of those, to include this order, was unhappy 5 times.=C2=A0 Completely unh=
appy twice.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I could bitch about a missing ounce from one order,=
 but only cause it was the GDP, he sent me plenty of extra ounces in other=
 orders before and previous.=C2=A0 The other times involved hash, but that=
 was SD's fault for setting the bar so high.=C2=A0 He came on the Road and=
 fucked EVERYONE up with Hash the was a gift from the Gods!!=C2=A0 =C2=A0So=
me of the other batches not as good, but not bad compared to what was on th=
e Road.=C2=A0 Ear Wax.=C2=A0 =C2=A0Sent me a ounce of that, but now that I=
 think about it, I do not remember paying for it, even though he claimed I=
 did--- so x that off.=C2=A0 So 4 bad trans out of 25.=C2=A0 That is not a=
 bad trans rate for what we were dealing with.<br><br>The two bad trans.=C2=
=A0 I already wrote about the seedy lb I got, and I think that was my last=
 dealing with him before this transaction.=C2=A0 Fuck, now that I write and=
 read this out, I really only feel shunted and pissed about two transaction=
s out of 25+.<br><br>Well SD, perhaps in the bigger picture of things, I am=
 not seeing things as clearly as others.=C2=A0 Yea, I am not happy about cu=
stomers returning product, but at the same time, those same people still ta=
lk about the GDP nearly a year later, and you know my feelings about your=
 Hash.<br><br>Yea, I know how much=C2=A0 you go through.=C2=A0 Yea, I know=
 a little about SR vending now, and I also know how much of a stress case=
 it would be filling your shoes.=C2=A0 Since I just wrote a novel complimen=
ting you more than sharing my displeasure about a past order, and this rece=

 couple cannabis purchases I have had on the Road coupled=C2=A0 with yours=
 just kicked my lid right off.=C2=A0 And though your reasonable SD, you are=
 most time very reasonable, the last thing I wanted to fucking do was come=
 and complain to you on my first order back.=C2=A0 You would of rolled your=
 eyes, and said fuck---even though, and a good chance you did not even see=
 what you sent me.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I get it, that much business, you have help,=
 as you could not fulfill orders and still answer messages, eat, shit, slee=

				I put it in there as buds.=C2=A0 During the process of vac sealing it=
 combined with postal workers throwing boxes around and barrying them under=
 other boxes etc buds can turn to shake. On top of that moisture leaves bud=
 over time causing the weight to be off. If you don't believe me. Leave a=
 pile of fresh weed out on the table for a few hours when you come back it=
 will be less than when you put it there.=20

				Hey guys I ordered a QP of the indoor as well and received it on Monday=
 but haven't had time to write this review until now! <br><br>Communication=
-5/5 SDM always messaged me back rather quickly and professionally. Before=
 I ordered I noticed that his other indoor postings were for snowcaps and=
 I just shot a message his way saying that I'd like try something other tha=
n snowcaps (I've had snowcaps aloooooot recently and like to switch it up)=
 and he said he would give me another indoor strain. Simple as that!<br><br=
>Shipping-5/5 This was by far the most stealthy packaging I have seen while=
 I've been on the Road. There was no odor in the package at all. It was shi=
pped on a Saturday and got to me on Monday. Very quick.<br><br>Product-5/5=
 Let me start by saying WOW. This bud is great. I got some of the indoor Bl=
ue Dream and before I even took it out of the last vacuum seal I could alre=
ady notice tons of shimmering crystals covering the buds! There were no sma=
ll buds, some smaller buds weighing in at .6 and many larger ones ranging=
 from1.4-2.5g. Upon smoking some the first thing I noticed was the taste!=
 sort of almost sweet I would say. I would say much more indica than sativa=
.<br><br>Overall I am extremely pleased with this order and am thinking abo=
ut placing an order for a HP as I've been looking for a solid bulk cannabis=
 vendor. Very pleasant transaction, Thanks SDM.

 about 10% of the whole bag!=C2=A0 I've ordered bulk from other vendors and=

g and the same stuff. The next few were lighter in color, almost looked lik=
e Moroccan Press, but was much headier. Then I got the blackish-green Chemy=
 stuff, that was some kind of crazy full-melt bubble, not sure how it was=
 extracted, as it had an unusual texture, but it melted into vapor on a dab=
, no ethanol taste, no watery taste, just good sour d/chemdawgy taste with=
 an incredible sativa high(pretty sure this was made from ECSD). That was=
 the best non-wax, non-oil concentrate I've ever had. The following batch=
 was pretty much straight kief. As stated, I didn't complain... I just made=
 mad edibles instead of selling the hash outright. Though, I did sell 2 oun=
ces of it to a friend, who just loaded bowls and bowls of it for months. He=
 loved it, but he also smokes mids usually, so it was an easy way to turn=
 his shitty bowls into great bowls.<br><br>But, imo, even the kief hash I=
 got the last time(right before SDM stopped listing it) was worth $850 for=
 120+ grams. Cheaper than most QPs of high grade weed... complaining at tha=

 i know they will be happy with what is currently being offered!!<br><br>No=

 all honesty, both those vendors are top notch!!!=C2=A0 =C2=A0Really-----So=
 anyone reading this, please read first!!!=C2=A0 Both Tweet and Humboldt ar=
e top notch vendors and are complete and utter assets to this community!!!!=
<br><br>That being said-------and I have to qualify for honesty, as its my=
 trademark---both good and bad:{:}<br><br>OK----Last batch I bought from Tw=
eet-----3 months ago.=C2=A0 Got a .5lb of some discount pot that made me a=
 lot of fuckin money!!!!!!!=C2=A0 On top I got a qp of hash.=C2=A0 =C2=A0<b=
r><br><br>SD's current hash---------as I have said , and from what I have=
 experienced-----(please know batches change), but from my assessment,=C2=
=A0 it goes SD=3D=3D=3DHumboldt------Tweet<br><br><br>This hurts for me to=
 label, cause I do not like fucking with vendor business!!=C2=A0 So I can=
 also say, that what I got from Humboldt and Tweet than is different than=
 now-----but SD now, is better than then.=C2=A0 Why..=C2=A0 =C2=A0One, less=
 harsh.=C2=A0 =C2=A0A bit fresher, I like hash to be soft, not brick hard!!=
!=C2=A0 Its got better appeal<br><br>That being said.....I have not got any=
 recent batches from Tweet or Humboldt.<br><br>I know with Tweet, and Tweet=
, this is not to be negative against your business, but more forthright, bu=
t Tweet changed his front page about bubble hash for all to read=C2=A0 base=
d on my reviews.=C2=A0 =C2=A0Do not call it bubble hash unless it bubbles!!=
=C2=A0 But from what I know from Tweet this is not always true?<br><br><br>=
I think SD has the best quality for quantity at the moment on SR.=C2=A0 If=
 you want a double or full melt, do not buy----spend the extra 40$ a g for=
 that. <br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botslice_q=
uote"></div></div>Hmm when i tried tweetbe's hash i thought it was great.=
 definitely bubbled and had a great taste and smell. Maybe when u got a bad=
 batch i got a good one. I was expecting you to say tweet's was better but=
 it sounds like your saying sd's is better? <br>IDK why you wouldn't want=
 to answer the question, why would comparing competing products offend the=
 vendors or w/e? I Love tweetbe and HF. Just curious about what to expect.=
 <br>honestly by your description of sd's current batch what Ive gotten fro=
m tweet in the past sounds better (which i expect cuz its at a higher price=
) but i guess all these opinions are all subjective. Maybe the hash u got=
 from tweet is the same i got but u just have very high standards. but i di=
gress, ill probably order regardless cuz im sure itll be a great product fo=
r the price no matter what. <br>Just hope SD will still not mind dealing wi=
th me cuz of our problem a couple weeks ago. I might be nervous about getti=
ng the right stuff if i was buying bud off him but im sure thered be no pro=
blems buying hash, as long as he doesn't start selling more than one type=
 at a time.<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botsli=

 developed a new method, known as lIght deprivation, or suppression grows=
 that has resulted in a similar quantum leap in potency. Unlike regular out=
door buds that must finish in less than ideal autumn temperatures and falli=
ng light, cannabis plants grown under light deprivation are tricked into fi=
nishing when the temperatures and light are still optimal. As a result of=
 using this new method, buds from a properly run suppression grow are huge,=
 dense, and heavily laden with sparkly dank resin."<br><br>I suggest you gu=
ys read a little more into it! I've been smoking the good herb for a few ye=
ars now, and I'm very accustomed to the style of growing around my parts be=
cause I Always bought local until this last summer where I worked with 2 ge=
nts in Cali. One fell off, and the other I have been working with to this=
 day: Sourdieselman. But anyway, the pot around here is very generic imo.=
 It's GOOD, but the growers are more concerned with aesthetics and yield.=
 The pot I get from SDM regularly is always Light Dep. His indoor is killer=
 killer, yes, but for the price you just can't beat the light dep in my opi=
nion. His light dep doesn't aesthetically look as good as the indoor(well=
 sometimes it does i.e. LD sour diesel), but when the growers use the light=
 dep technique the buds become SO resinated. Anyone who squeezes a nugget=
 of SDM's buds can attest to the high resin levels. <br><br>SDM has clearly=
 got this shit down pat in my books. And aside from him handling this crazy=
 volume of buds, he keeps his packaging safe. If you follow the rules to th=
e Mail Order Marijuana game, then you have little to worry about. With SDM'=
s packaging, the chance of interception is very low. And even if it does ge=
t caught, I wouldn't be too worried about a CD over a QP of weed. They will=
 throw that shit the fuck away and move on to the next package, because the=
y simply don't have the resources to stop anything but the worthwhile-sized=
 shipments out of Cali. I know of dudes who had 5 pounds of weed get stoppe=
d in the mail. And guess what happened? Nothing. No knock at the door. No=
 police surveillance. Nothing. Tracking went dead and that's it. Don't let=
 me fool you into becoming complacent though. Because at the end of the day=
, LE can still pin some hefty charges on your ass for ordering weed in the=
 mail. <br><br><br><br>TL;DR:=C2=A0 Fuck yea SDM!<br></blockquote><div clas=
s=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div><br>Wow, thanks=
 for the information! I knew what I received was light dep, but I guess I=
 just didnt connect the dots with the LD part lol. But yes, I agree, his bu=
ds are very resinated, pretty sticky, and has a decent smell to it...the bu=
ds are also very dense, my oz's look like half oz's in the bag, just becaus=

				Got some of the GH.=C2=A0 Packed well, could be slightly better for all=
 intensive cases but otherwise good.=C2=A0 A good amount ( 3.014) grams of=
 bare stems was pulled, a further amount of shake (weighed approximate whin=
ed about features over (+ ~4g) , whining not intended, blatant blunt honest=
y), not quite finished curing (will be fine), very light compression but st=
ill fluffy, nice structure under 20x optics. Taste improves with a few hour=
s of air drying or jar keeping, taste off the bat a bit harsh but if broken=
 up and left to sit in open air for a few minutes even, the taste improves=
 greatly. Overall, unquestionably worth it and great vendor.

				SDM - THANK YOU!! My first order from SDM and I'm still smiling days la=
ter. If you want good bud with great customer service, order from SDM.<br><=
br>Product - Excellent! Sour Diesel with a wonderful smell. Hints of lemon=
 and really strong overall. Buds were nice sized (but not huge) and trimmed=
 well. High is great and very heady. Fucking is very fun with this high and=
 my gal loves it. 6grams over on QP order.<br><br>Shipping time - Excellent=
! It was very fast even though I had sent an unreadable GPG message initial=
ly and had to resend address. Still 2 days from order to delivery - FAST!<b=
r><br>Packaging - Sufficient - triple layer and no smell. No worries at all=
 with the fast delivery. Looked like any other business package in the mail=
.<br><br>Communication - Excellent! Even with his busy schedule SDM was ver=
y responsive. <br><br>Pricing - Very fair! - For SR pricing SDM is very fai=
r and competitive. If I got this quality of bud every time I would say it's=
 an excellent deal.<br><br>I will be ordering again from SDM and suggest yo=
u do so as well. With the volume of business he does I'm sure the quality=
 with vary a little but when you do get orders like this it is way worth it=

				So back to reality.. Where is everyone going to start ordering their bu=

 prices were $800/qp for indoor and it was always available. I purchased at=
 least 10 qps from him and some were better than others but they were all=
 good. I never had a problem moving any of his indoor. So what do you guys=

				Think we know who SD was, and if correct, was locked up for short time=

				No need to post the message SDM supposedly sent out looks totally fake=
