 what's the best method to get an official response from SR? Do you need a=

 Do you send messages on the SR Site. Do any SR techies ( other than DPR)=

				Up until the new site layout was up you could simply go to account &gt;=
feedback and it would show a chronological list of=C2=A0 all of your purcha=
ses (including item,vendor, price etc). For me it went 9-10 months because=
 that is when I made my first purchase.. That single list gives virtually=
 the whole thing away (transactions are never getting deleted). A fairly st=
andard multi shopfront DB table layout would likely be being used. With sql=
 access you could get Total customers for a vendor, Total revenue by Vendor=
, Select all Sales transaction from vendor Bob, etc,

				My question is why would he have 9+ months worth? There is no reason to=
 keep it for say a week past finalization. It's a huge amount of data he's=

				I posted this in the other thread also but id like more peoples opinion=
s on my view...<br><br>Even if LE found "transactions" on your account its=
 still very hard for them to bust you because that isnt "proof beyond a rea=
sonable doubt" that you did infact recieve drugs. Maybe your just circulati=
ng coins with a vendor to leave positive feedback on their page...and in re=
turn they send you the btc you gave them as cash in the mail plus some prof=
it added for the service. See what im getting at? If they dont have you in=
 posession of the drugs or intercept the drugs coming to you then it makes=
 it very difficult for them to stick charges just based on account stats.=
 What kind of charges could they throw at you...not possesion, maybe intent=
 to purchase or some type of conspiracy to commit illegal activity...i dunn=
o??=20

ed.<br><br>transaction records, including feedback are kept for 4 months.=
=C2=A0 I said 3 in another thread, but upon double checking, it is 4.=C2=A0=
 We do this because the data contained in the transaction record, including=
 the buyer, is used to weight the feedback for that transaction.=C2=A0 Afte=
r 4 months, the age weight has pretty much reduced the weight to zero anywa=
y, so we no longer need the data.=C2=A0 If you want further explanation abo=
ut this, check out the wiki page and forum thread about the feedback weight=
ing system.<br><br>the accounting log is kept for 3 months.=C2=A0 Only 2 we=
eks are displayed so an adversary who gains access to your account won't be=
 able to see all of that history.<br><br>withdrawal addresses are not kept,=
 but everyone should realize that the time and amount of the withdrawal cou=
ld narrow down which transaction it was in the blockchain quite a bit, espe=
cially if it was an uncommon amount.<br><br>deleted items are kept for 4 mo=
nths.=C2=A0 this is to preserve the integrity of the link to the transactio=

				I've read the thread you linked to and im not entirely clear on what th=
e problem is. Ok, so SR retains a complete history of our purchases:<br><br=
>1. Unless you bought btc using a method that left a papertrail then theres=
 no way to link that wallet address to you.<br>2. Even if you did leave a=
 paper trail, there's no way to associate a wallet address with SR unless=
 the SR database gets compromised<br>3. Even if the SR database gets compro=
mised, there's no way to legally assert that you bought drugs unless you se=
nt your address in plaintext, or the seller was a cop<br>4. Even if all the=
se things happened, they still would have to prove that you received the dr=
ugs. <br>5. If all that shits happens, then you screwed up and are fucked.=
 <br><br>Yes i understand that since they store old addresses linked to you=
r account it only takes one papertrail to link you to the account, if the=
 site gets compromised. The thing is how are we supposed to know what data=
 sr is storing? They can say whatever they want, or configure the site to=
 make it appear as if they're storing less than they are, you have no way=
 of knowing. Assume they work like google and save everything in triplicate=
. <br><br>The thing is not to give them any data. Buy coins with cash, or=
 buy with a card and send it through the fog before going into SR. Encrypt=
 your address. Deal with the fact that its highly more likely the cops will=
 hunt you down after having found drugs in your mail than they will hunt SR=
 down and veritably demonstrate that TOR can be broken (something the highe=
r ups like the NSA would rather not do). It seems like SR is a huge target,=
 but there's been CP sites on tor hidden services for as long as tor has be=
en around and no LEO has ever taken one down (though hackers have DDOS'd th=
em to death). <br><br>If you're worried about the low hanging fruit making=
 these mistakes then petition to have the wiki amended with an emphasis on=
 this info. Demanding DPR do something you can't audit in the first place=
 isn't going to solve anything.=20
