				Thanks for the heads up SR. Personally I don't do business with anyone=
 without feedback, and even once feedback is established I'm wary because=
 there are people faking feedback. That's unfortunate that you've been gett=
ing threatened though. Has it been LE or just angry sellers who want to be=
 able to scam?(if you don't mind me asking, that is) Good luck and keep fig=

				@j789745: The whole site isn't a scam, but many of the users are. It do=
esn't offer an escrow service like SR does, so it's much easier to scam. Th=
ere are also people using fake identities with the usernames of reputable=
 sellers from SR (although these should be pretty easy to figure out via th=
eir public keys). I wouldn't write the site off completely, as they may exp=

 giving away your bitcoins. You're giving your address to a stranger!

 popular, and this guy said he was starting a new forum, so I went, and fig=
