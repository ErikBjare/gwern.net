				from what I had looked up about shipping acid I figured putting it in=
 foil would be extremely sketchy and very easily detected, I will try takin=
g a couple asap (might be able to tonight) and report back asap, to everyon=
e who bought, again, I am extremely sorry, you will all of course get a com=
pletely full refund and I really didnt think even for a second that these=
 could be bunk because of the source I got them from is very close to me
