				I have an order in with him that I've been waiting on for a week, but=
 I personally have no reason to doubt that it will show. I'm international=
 (US) and he didn't ask me to FE. Decent sized order too. Comm's have been=
 excellent so far, and his recent feedback on his vendor page is not filled=
 with FE requests. All of his recent feedback on his vendor page except for=
 one order to AUS was delivered and the feedback is great, product and deli=
very time as well. The one order that didn't get through based on his feedb=
ack page was issued a partial refund. <br><br>I just got burned by Noriega,=
 and so I'm on high alert, but this doesn't seem like scammer behavior to=
 me personally based on the previous patterns I've seen. Just sharing my ex=
perience and viewpoint here. We should always be skeptical, but lets just=
 give the man some time to respond. He's only been offline for a day or two.

 at the Canada end. <br><br>Let's get something straight - if MIN was a sca=
mmer, his listings would be up and he'd be trying to get everyone to FE bas=
ed on his rep, which is exactly what CFMF did. <br><br>Instead, we have som=
eone who is communicating and has taken his listings down. <br><br>Sorry bu=
t that doesn't seem like scamming. Its more like MINs run into a spot of bo=
ther and just needs some time. <br><br>Grey

				I'm really worried about what's happened to MIN. 4 days ago he messaged=
 me stating that he had just stocked up, the gear was a little more expensi=
ve than usual but supposedly really nice coke. He told me that he wanted to=
 try the coke out for himself before listing it on SR and that he would mes=
sage me when the listings were up. Haven't heard a thing since!=C2=A0 He ha=
sn't been on here now for 3 days which is not like MIN. Hope he is Ok and=
 everything is alright. Fingers crossed.

<br>Yep. This vehement opposition to discussing the consequences of SR comm=
erce reeks like a vagina full of week-old fish. I sometimes get the impress=
ion that SR mods are far more interested in protecting the image of SR rath=
er than giving a shit about the participants in its economy. Operation MINi=
mize is a PR campaign designed to ensure people don't get spooked and cost=
 SR commissions. My suspicions are that they're less afraid of LE (you moth=
erfuckers can go fuck yourselves -- I know you're reading you pieces of shi=
t) than they are a magazine or blog connecting MIN's bust to SR, creating=
 an indelible impression that SR isn't as safe as the admins tout it to be.=
 Like Monsanto going ape shit when people want their genetically altered or=
ganisms labelled.

 some big assumptions there. the news story said the father was an engineer=
 so i assume he worked and may have had little if anything to do with the=
 business. i could see a wife telling her husband she made an internet busi=
ness with their son and it turning out the internet business was selling ya=
y lol cool moms are cool<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div cl=

cede that. However it's still fucking dirt that they dragged their kids int=
o it. Fucking degenerates.<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div=
 class=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div><br>You're still making some assumpti=
ons here. In fact, I would tend to think quite the opposite, as I doubt thi=
s 47 year old mother would be savvy enough with both drugs and deep web to=
 find and establish a presence on SR. Here's what I think is more likely to=
 have happened.<br><br>The young, 22 year-old boy, curious about something=
 he read about, stumbles upon SR. He has coke connections, and he's already=
 fairly comfortable with his family &amp; coke (knows his sister did/does=
 it and mom did/does it). He then would be the one to introduce it to his=
 mom, who he knows is drug-friendly. Brothers and Sisters talk about everyt=
hing, and it'd be easy for the sister to learn of SR as well. There are num=
erous motivations for making money, so it's pretty feasible that if they th=
ought they could pull it off they even could have come up with it together,=
 however it's my suspicion that the kids were more ambitious to get started=
 than the mom. The only reason I picked the Son to be the initial is becaus=
e the article says "Mother and Son" in the beginning and nothing about the=
 daughter until later.<br><br>Also, because the mother faces the bulk of th=
e charges, that means she was probably the one delivering the packages. In=
 a multi-person operation, package delivery is on the low end, meaning that=
 was probably her contribution to the project, while the Son handled the co=
mputer stuff.<br><br>It's all speculation though, and you could come up wit=
h an infinite number of scenarios that would fit. It's just not worth getti=
ng your panties in a bunch over.
