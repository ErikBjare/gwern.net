				Just got my first VALID AND USED with T-Mart BTC address.<br>From what=
 I can see of it, the coins seams to had been split in two chunks. One is=
 rather small, about 5% of the whole amount, and headed to some busy place,=
 like looking at a SR or MtGox entry address.<br>The remaining about 95% we=
nt to a solo account filled up with big chunks. I need more samples to be=
 sure, but by the looks of it, it's T-Mart's main wallet. Last sending move=
ment was at 2012-04-29 09:10 and receiving 2012-04-30 00:09, so all it seam=
s that by 29th someone was still there to move coins out. By this time ther=
e was already no communication from Tony, who was last seen 25th.<br><br>If=
 I'm looking at the right address, the scam extent, just of T-Mart side is=
 of 5 832.80 bitcoins. A few more samples would help to prove it.<br><br>So=
rry for not pick my original thread, but I can't find it within this mess.<=
br><br>Edit: Also note, I'll not publish the addresses themselves until I'm=
 sure those can actually help and not harm who made the transfers to there.

				eeee. i posted in a thread yesterday where u were going on with your do=
omsday scenarios but u never answered me - you just said i didnt want to be=
leive or some nonsense. i will beleive you if you can explain in detail how=
 its possible to crack multiple layers of encryption and bring down SR - bu=
t you wont be able to explain because you're just a troll and not smart eno=
ugh.. oh and because its not feasibly possible to crack that much encryptio=
n!! i posted some very technical questions because I am very fucking IT sma=
rt myself and I challenge you to "geek" it out here and explain to me how=
 it's possible to decrypt multiple, multiple layers of STRONG encryption?=
 the "theoretical" cracking of regular PGP / AES/ SSL 2048 or 4096 bit encr=
yption would take years even with todays modern high powered cray super com=
puters and compute clusters. i think you've been reading WAY too many artic=
les about that NSA center they're designing. First off... ITS NOT BUILT YET=
!!! Also u mentioned how big n powerful it would be which made u look like=
 an idiot. U said they had tons and tons of storage which we all know from=
 the article but u mentioned SSD storage=C2=A0 like that made it even more=
 powerful and high capacity - you were trying to convince us that you are=
 IT smart but u clearly proved you're nothing but a poser and probably call=
s Geeksquad at BestBuy every time you get a virus from trying to download=
 free porn.=C2=A0 Let me explain how and why you're so stupid by mentioning=
 SSD as if it had any importance. First of all, nobody uses SSD for large=
 storage arrays!! it is primarily used for fast IO situations like in a RAI=
D array it can be used as a cache drive - using an SSD drive to cache the=
 data before its read/written to disk can significantly speed up IO operati=
ons on lower speed drives - larger capacity drives=C2=A0 =3D slower speeds.=
 thats why u dont see any 3TB or even 1TB, 10-15K SAS/Fiber channel drives.=
 secondly you're a dumb fuck. what difference does the type of storage make=
 in the doomsday scenario you were trying to paint? stop trying to sound sm=
art because having SSD disks doesnt make anything more "powerful" or whatev=
er the fuck. last, you dumb ignorant fuck, SSD disks are the WORST type of=
 drives for large storage capacity needs. If they are going to storage all=
 the worlds encrypted data, I recommend they use a shitton of 3TB enterpris=
e SATA disks. sure throw some SSD in as a cache for performance reasons but=
 thats it. the point of all this geek talk in a drug forum is that the supe=
r data center that isnt built yet isnt going to bring SR down. neither is=
 the encryption used here going to be cracked and expose us. there is simpl=
y too much encryption: TOR, hardware, software, database, internode, SR int=
ernal, PGP and possibly privnote cannot be all cracked. theyd be lucky if=
 they cracked one of those levels in the next 5 years... or life time. if=
 they cracked two levels they deserve a gold star! no no.. THREE gold stick=
ers!!! now im not saying shit isnt brewing in the DEA/FBI ... im sure it is=
, but if anyones busted it will be by taking the site down entirely and if=
 DPR revelaed all his encryption keys. highly unlikely though because the=
 man is a genious and probably has so many different sites in countries tha=
t would love to tell the USA to fuck themselves, even if they managed to cr=
ack some of Tor and get a real IP address. do u think DPR has actually setu=
p these servers in remote countries under his real name or any traceable pa=
yment? of course not. hes probably paying his datacenter bills in bitcoins=
 directly or cashing them to prepaid visas or something and paying that way=
. i am not too too worried about DPR. the man is fuckin smart.<br><br>what=
 i am worried about is you. Your native instinct to sell Tony out to LE wre=
aks of LE. You want that to happen so anyone assoicated with him gets burne=
d. I will admit I was very positive Tony wasnt scamming but i was clearly=
 wrong &amp; i suppose eeee was right from the beginning that tony was scam=
ming. but that doesnt change that eeee is a fuck tard and was wrong about=
=C2=A0 everything else and still is. <br><br>We all know tony is reading th=
is.. he's probably a bit nervous now that some of his trail has been follow=
ed by people much smarter then him... but he will never reveal himself beca=
use he clearly was a sociopath and a ballsless peice of shit.. probably mol=
ested by his step dad and neglected and beaten by his mother. but he's rich=
 now so what the fuck right? tony i/we all trusted u and this is how u rewa=
rd us and scar SR? the damage u have caused to SR is huge. not to mention=
 that one dude who said he was going to kill himself if he didnt get his or=
der. what if he really did kill himself because he lot alot, was WDing from=
 your "killer" H and couldnt afford anymore and just couldnt take the pain?=
 blood on your hands u fuck.<br><br>i hope u enjoy OUR money and bang alot=
 of hookers too.. and i also hope one of the hookers gives u an STD that ma=
kes your tiny dick burn like a muthabitch and your nuts have to be removed.=
 haha. Fuck you Tony. I trusted u and stood up for you while others were ha=
ting. Seriously, FUCK YOU TONY. <br><br>And to DaMan. Nice job tracking dow=
n some of the money like a fuckin boss! Kinda scarey actually though how ea=
sy that was for u. Im assuming it was only possible because it was thru T-M=
art right? I hope it wouldnt be as easy thru SR cuz theres supposed to be=
 a tumbler in place.<br><br>eeee you are a debbie downer and not welcome he=
re. after tonys burn (and from the looks of it noriega) we need all the lov=
e and positive vibes around here that we can get. if u have such concerns=
 and are really that smart why dont u provide us the community, and ultimat=
ely DPR with suggestions on any holes that you may have discovered and how=
 to fix them?=20

				eeee you are still a giant fear mongering troll but I have to admit tha=
t mtgox stuff is kinda concerning. What if a buyer has a balance in their=
 SR wallet, then transfers it back, tumbling or not, to Mtgox and converts=
 to USD currency and wire to their bank? Does that mean that someone would=
 be assumed a drug dealer? It certainly implies they are atleast a drug buy=
er which may not even be true cuz u theres other stuff besides drugs here=
 - even discount electronics! Or what about our actual non drug vendors who=
 are just selling small things like ebooks, electronics, guides, porn, etc?=
 they probably make a pretty penny from ppl trying to build their stats. ar=
e they going to be accused of being drug dealers too? Bitcoin is supposed=
 to be anonymous but if the guys at mtgox are going to hand over our info=
 to LE when we have not actually sold drugs but have no way to prove we did=
nt, then we are in trouble. I still stand by all my points about it being=
 nearly impossible to crack all the layers of encryption involved with TOR=
 and SR. but if mtgox or any other bitcoin exchange is going to be a sqeaky=
 wheel then we're in big trouble. I am hoping that not actually living in=
 the USA is to my advantage. <br><br>i think this is a serious concern that=
 should be brought up in another thread. regarding the bitcoin records that=
 DPR keeps. it is known that previous addresses are stored in a database an=
d can be used again. im not sure if that is indefinitely or for a period of=
 time but the fact is it's traceable data in a DB. i think this should be=
 removed completely. after 2 or 3 days previous addresses are purged foreve=
r. and any other bitcoin &amp; shipping address information is not stored=
 in any part of the DB any longer then 2 or 3 days after which will be purg=
ed forever.=20

 too worried about that, but boy would I hate to have LE knocking on my doo=

 you want to maybe write a tutorial on how a guy can give his coin a good=

				oh also one more thing.<br>I guess it depends on how sr manage the func=
tions, i guess many wallets must be in use. But i would have thought, if yo=
u can track bitcoins, the safety of sr is the fact they are tumbled and mix=
ed with everyone elses, coming out as bits and pieces.<br>But say sr only=
 used 1 sending address only. Once you knew that address, i guess you could=
 find any outbound transactions from sr, trace them to the exchange, and th=
e exchange identify the person.<br>So it's likely sr uses many wallet/exit=
 addresses. But say they identify say tony because of foolishly working wit=
h a third party service, could you not then identify his other bitcoins tha=
t came from sr, trace thier address back until you get the sr address, and=
 then watch that address?<br>I suppose it's hard to identify which of the=
 addresses in the sequence are the sr exit address, but presumably once you=
 know it, you could monitor it, and that given address would be compromised=
?<br>My guess is sr has many exit points, and would need to consider discar=
ding the potentially compromised exit addresses? I would also guess this ma=
y inherintly give away the sr tumble address nodes too.<br>I don't know eno=
ugh about it to say for sure, any comments?

				That's a good reason why single purpose markets can't exist, they would=
 be very easy to track down, what makes The Armory a very lousy idea unless=
 it shares the bitcoind with SR. You can get into SR's core but you can't=

				The risk of being identified by bitcoin is fairly low if you took any=
 precautions at all (such as moving the money through SR or buying anonymou=
sly).<br>I recommend everybody look into how to buy bitcoins completely ano=
nymously rather than using sites like MtGox. It usually costs a small premi=
um... but it is definitely worth it.<br><br>The real risk here is that Tony=
 does something irresponsible, gets busted, and all the addresses that, as=
 far as we know, are still on his computer, are taken by LE.<br>This seems=
 particularly likely if you put your address in T-Mart.<br><br>Still... I=
 am not overly concerned about this. Bastard or not, Tony is obviously both=
 patient and intelligent.<br>If he is transferring his coins to MtGox he mu=
st have good reason to believe they are not traceable - fake identity, cont=
acts at MtGox... whatever.<br><br>Pure speculation of course, just my take=
 on the situation.

 it, it's not hard to imagine. Matter is just a form of condensation, energ=

 so hard to believe that negative energy can imprint itself upon chemicals?=
 Anyone who has ever even had a passing interest in chemistry has no doubt=

 with LSD I think it's even more important.

				An user sent me a PM in order to help on wash coins, so I wrote a small=
 guide on this issue to him and though it would be good to share it with th=
e community:<br><br><div class=3D"quoteheader"><div class=3D"topslice_quote=
">Quote</div></div><blockquote class=3D"bbc_standard_quote">To wash coins=
 you need to stir them with someone else's coins, SR does this already, thu=
s you'll be getting coins used with SR. A while ago this was done by upload=
ing them to an e-wallet, but since MyBitcoin scam that becomes too risky,=
 I'd lost some coins there too.<br>The alternative now is to diversify the=
 places taken by the ones you're more or less comfortable with, like upload=
 a chunk (don't ever upload your whole money anywhere as any of those sites=
 can vanish in the wind at any moment, SR included) to MtGox, another to Vi=
rwox, another to bitcoin.de, etc, NOT use this first loop for actually trad=
e and use fake accounts.<br>Like this: you create a fake account at Virwox,=
 upload 50 btc (vary about MtGox as with big sums they might force you to=
 identify yourself and you can't access it from Tor), shortly after you wit=
hdraw like 40 btc to MtGox from that account, so MtGox will be receiving 40=
 btc from Virwox which are already different coins from the ones you sent=
 there before. Get the picture? You need to swap coins in order to get them=
 exchanged for someone else's coins before can cash them out to a bank acco=
unt or something linked to you IRL.<br>Another option would be to use green=
 dot visa cards, but again be careful when withdrawing, don't go always to=
 the same machine, as ATM's takes pictures of those using them.<br><br>You=
 may need to check whether the service you're using to swap coins as a tumb=
ler or not, to do this: upload 10 btc there and note the address you used,=
 wait a while and withdraw those coins, note the address you withdraw them=
 to. Go to blockexplorer.com and check for the entry address, follow the co=
ins to where they had been sent, if the same 10 btc shows in your exit addr=
ess then the site isn't tumbling, otherwise it is.<br><br>Also it's importa=
nt to be a bit creative here, not use always the same method, number of loo=
ps or sources used. The more random it gets the better.</blockquote><div cl=

><br>I was also busy dealing with that tranny Noriega that "shipped" my ord=
er on the 2nd of April that never arrived. I love how he is doing you a fav=
or my refunding 50% of your money?BTC=C2=A0 -=C2=A0 when in all reality, th=
e order never shipped and he collects 50% of your order - make sense?<br><b=
r>But this whole Tony thing makes makes me a sad panda.<br><br>I bought his=
 first samples when He first arrived at SR and have been a loyal customer=
 ever since that moment. He made #1 before SR changed the way the rate Vend=
ors.<br><br>My bet is he was compromised or felt the heat and bailed the fu=
ck out. He had so many personal sales and SR sales that he could of scammed=
 on - sure, I could be wrong, but I think he bailed feeling he had no choic=
e but to lay low for a while - sucks he didn't refund the BTC/money.<br><br=
>But this here, what I am about to quote sums it up perfectly=C2=A0 -=C2=A0=
 and T, I hope you are reading this, but I doubt he is on SR - until I read=
 some solid evidence that he is back.<br><br>BTW - FUCK that tranny Noriega=
 fuck - you guys in the EU need to buy from psi or anyone else - otherwise=
 you are keeping them in business and I consider you a traitor - I don't ca=
re that all his coke got through - only his H never showed from 90% of the=
 buyers for the past month - the WD's are just around the corner- yeah !!!<=

 as I would have written it:<br><br><br>"We all know tony is reading this..=
 he's probably a bit nervous now that some of his trail has been followed=
 by people much smarter then him... but he will never reveal himself becaus=

 that one dude who said he was going to kill himself if he didnt get his or=

				Thanks DaMan! I've learned a lot about how BTC move around and the bloc=
k chain thanks to this discussion. Sucks about Tony, I wasn't involved with=
 him fortunately, but at least this thread had something interesting to lea=

 now from accounts that are linked to my real name.=20

				This Tony76 business gives me chills when I think how about a month ago=
 on another forum he basically proposed to everyone there that he would be=
 able to sell sheets for 400 a pop if members there would explain to him th=
e most effective way to turn high volumes of coins into usable cash anonymo=
usly.<br><br>He said that if he was unable to get better prices because his=
 supplier didnt take bitcoin, so by not being able to cash out large volume=
s fast enough, he was unable to get better prices....BUT, if someone was ab=
le to school him in a method to do this properly, he would have no problem=
 getting sheets at a better price, and would be able to offer them on the=
 forum for 400 a sheet.<br><br>In hindsight.......he was probably just fish=
ing for methods to convert coins into cash.<br><br>I am so bleak about him=
 going scammer.....<br><br>Another warning sign I should have taken note of=
 on the other site....guys there said it was very odd for him to be selling=
 other drugs like heroin and coke....they didnt think he was a scammer or=
 anything, a few people just posted that it was very odd.<br><br>From now=
 on.....I will only get L from acid heads!

				I've been scammed 3 times on sr, all 3 times were reputable vendors on=
 their way out. sellers rip and run. its just what they do. it happens in=
 real life too, buyers decide they arent going to use a seller anymore so=
 they get a big front and never go back. Its just something that is going=
 to happen. i dont think tony was planning to scam and i dont think it was=
 a long con. i was lucky and only got taken for 200 by tony, normally it wo=
uld have been 800 but i was low on funds. But still i feel i got my value=
 out of him for the months of great service i got. he was great when it cam=
e to selling. was amazing he could get all those orders out so fast. I neve=
r had a problem with him. <br><br>I dont know what the fuck that suicide th=
ing was about but its retarded, dude was buying heroin probably internation=
ally in the mail and was going to kill himself if an order didnt show. what=
 if a package got seized or misplaced. thats just stupid. <br><br>I'm lucky=
 and feel i got my value from tony, i'm sure others dont. but we should rem=
ember the good times. hopefully we will get good new vendors and we can onl=
y hope they are as good as tony was during the good times.=20
