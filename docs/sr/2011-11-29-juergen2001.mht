				Well, he's a legit vendor for sure.=C2=A0 My second order on SR was fro=
m him, took 5 or 6 days from Germany to Northeast USA.=C2=A0 Also, this thr=

 of the review posters if you have specific question, or Juergen himself.<b=
r><br>Good luck with your research.<br><br>PS, If you order from him and yo=
ur in the states, you'll have to finalize early.=C2=A0 New buyers and inter=
national orders usually have to do this.=C2=A0 Lot's of people here have op=
inions on weather or not you should do this.=C2=A0 I took the chance and ev=
erything was good, but it's a choice you've gotta make.=C2=A0 Scan these fo=
rums before you make an order if you're new (I'm assuming because of your=
 post count, but new to the forums /=3D new to the road.)

				Ordered 1g of his brown crystal MDMA for some friends of mine, each of=
 whom have 20 years experience with ecstasy, and they've been raving over=
 the quality; among the best they've ever had, they said. Shipping time to=
 the USA only took ~6 days and the product was expertly and stealthily pack=
aged as to breeze through customs, no worries. You get some peace of mind=
 knowing that your product is being shipped out of Germany, which is arguab=
ly under less customs scrutiny than packages originating in The Netherlands=
.<br><br>I will be placing some more crystal orders from Juergen in the com=
ing weeks, as well as some of his Dalai Lama acid blotters (which I hear ar=
e as good as what went around in the 90's); no hesitation on my part to fin=
alize early as a courtesy since he did such a bang-up job the first time ar=
ound.<br><br>

				I bought from Juergen once so far... and I received my order about 3-4=

				I have place two orders from Juergen, both to the eastern US and both=
 were finalized early. In both cases Juergen had the fastest international=
 shipping out of any seller I've ever worked with. 4 business days each tim=
e, and that's from Germany all the way to Eastern USA.<br><br>The quality?=
 Excellent. Very very potent stuff! I have received two batched from Juerge=
n, a very white crystally batch, and his more recent orange batch. Both wer=
e VERY potent. 130-150mg was plenty for me and I usually take closer to 180=
mg. However, I have noticed a much more profound negative 'hangover' effect=
 the next day from Juergen's M. I have used Dr. Amsterdam's, freedome's, an=
d AAkoven, and while only Dr. Amsterdam can compare as far as quality, none=
 of those other batches had this pronounced hangover effect.<br><br>Overall=
? Highly recommended. Juergen is my go to guy when I NEED the product and=
 I have to be absolute sure that it's quality. A little impure or something=
? Maybe, but this stuff always has me rolling balls and doesn't ship from=
 NL, which has been a huge PITA lately.

				I have ordered 5 times from Juergen to Australia, all have arrived in=
 a very fast time (usually 7 business days which is awesome). I've only sam=
pled the white MD from a few months ago, which may have been MDEA. It was=
 still awesome though. Next few orders have been his tan crystals, which I=
 am very eager to try but haven't had an opportunity. I'm just stock piling=
 just in case SR ever closes down. As someone said, I'm also never touching=
 a pill again. Had way too many duds over here in Aus. And why pay for 2 -=
 3=C2=A0 duds (yes, pills are usually between $25 - $35 here) when you can=
 get a gram of probably the best MD this country has ever seen for the same=
 price. <br><br>But yes, J2001 is a champion. He and Aakoven are my go to=
 guys, I've got no reason to use anyone else on here. <br><br>Interested to=
 try the amphetamine, anyone got a review on it?

 gram of mdma that I really needed by the 15th of this month. I see that a=

 over 2 weeks. <br><br>Quick question -- for those of you on the eastern US=

				Just thought I would chime in and say Juergen is awesome, great packagi=

 on second order). I have tried his white batch, which I thoroughly enjoyed=
, both by itself and with AA's. It's definitely MDMA, I haven't been that=
 loved up and wasted in ages. It is extremely clean. I look forward to tryi=

				I can tell you my experience with Juergen. I know he has a very good re=
putation and he is known as a legit vendor. I ordered 1 g speed for my wife=
 (i prefer other drugs=C2=A0 ;) ). He asked to finalize early in his shop,=
 because he needs money to let the things go on. Because of his reputation=
 and because it cost only a few btc, i finalized early. To make long story=
 short, the letter doesn't arrive. I send him a message and he answered, th=
at it never happened before, that a letter did not arrive, wish was send in=
 the same country he life. And he offered me an extra by my next order. <br=

				I may be a newbie in the forum, but not at SR. That being said, I am al=
so waiting for nearly a month from a package from juergen. The longest it=
 has ever taken from him is 8 days for me. He keeps asking me to be patient=
, but the order was placed on Dec 20th. At what point does HE consider it=
 lost? I have faith he will make it right at some point, but I admit that=
 I am tired of waiting. That being said, he has been friendly throughout ou=
r communications over this. I will update the post when it arrives or it ge=

				Just wanted to share thoughts on Juergen.<br><br>Ordered 5g of Speed an=
d 2 grams of "brown crystal" MDMA early in December.<br><br>Took 12 days fo=
r both packages to arrive (lonnnng international journey) and this was righ=
t before Christmas, so probably the busiest time for international mail.<br=
><br>No dramas there. Packaging was profesh and secure.<br><br>MDMA was gre=
at (compared to what we can get locally). Strong, clean roll off 120mg, alm=
ost every one who tried it only needed 80mg with a little topup a while aft=
er. Made me a very popular guy on NYE, that's for sure...<br><br>The speed=
 on the other hand was whack... Had a nice speed smell but basically did no=
thing. Ended up giving away the remaining 3.5g to a friend so they could ta=
ke it to a party and sell it to college kids who don't know any better.<br>=
<br>Not sure what the deal is with the recent delays but I would definitely=
 purchase his MDMA again.<br><br>But just take that speed out off the shelf=
 and flush it man...

				I first heard about the possibility of heightened postal security throu=
ghout Europe in September 2011. I am also still in contact with a few peopl=
e in B.C who have given up on sending packages to an assortment of European=
 countries. Customers from Germany, France, and the Scandinavian countries=
 were even having trouble getting their OUT going COD's (cash on delivery)=
 confiscated. They were also being contacted by customs, for what, I don't=
 know. I am thinking the sellers didn't switch up their addresses frequentl=
y enough when receiving customer COD payments, could be numerous things, bu=
t one thing is for sure, they were checking OUT going mail. <br><br>I recen=
tly attended the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam that got raided. The Dutch autho=
rities were very nice about it and just made everyone give up their goods,=
 mostly vendors. The officers I spoke too were telling me that enormous pre=
ssure was put on them by Germany to clean up the scene. He said there was=
 a problem with German visitors bringing goods across the border and coming=
 back all shitfaced. <br><br>Not a knock against Germany, just seems like=
 all of Europe is moving towards the same type of postal security. Not tryi=
ng to scare anyone, and take into account that everything I have heard has=
 come from the marijuana community where shipping can be more of a hassle.=
 These are people who have been successfully running world wide mail order=
 mj businesses for over 10 yrs non stop, pretty sure they know what time it=
 is when it comes to postal service.<br><br>Believe me dude, there are heig=
htened security measures being taken right now. Hey, I will facebook messag=
e an old buddy of mine who will know exactly what places to watch out for.=
 I will come back and let you know, hopefully today because I would like to=
 know too. Peace.

				=C2=A0You're right, not exactly a 'major crackdown' haha. They are heig=
htening security though. Is it really because of Silk Road? It just doesn't=
 seem practical for numerous countries to spend millions of dollars on post=
al security because of the 'popularity' of one website, not self-understood=
 on my part. The place I worked for did much more business than here, they=
 have since 02-03. This is not a new concept to me, and I am quite aware of=
 the fact that this is the tip of the iceberg. <br>=C2=A0<br>I just heard=
 of this site last week when looking for some MDMA for my girlfriend and my=
self. Actually found it on Youtube when trying to find recipes for cooking=
 MDMA and meth. That heat bag needs to take that video down, I never would=
 have known if it weren't for that. Not very top secret.<br><br>Still asked=
 someone about what places they have had trouble sending/receiving. We need=
 to know these things, not to install fear, but to promote the successful=
 delivery of packages. This obviously has amazing potential, too bad all it=
 is going to take to get even more negative media exposure is for one of th=
ese slapdicks to sell someone a bad bag of H or E. <br>

				SR brings drugs to the small man, including teenagers. It is not the po=

nt agencies because media is aware of it as well now. This was not the case=
 with private forums. Just my two cents.<br><br>I am still not sure what yo=

 in those countries will know this, if not the information is all around th=

				Hey guys, the long awaited trip report of Juergen's "Mayas":<br><br>Sho=
rt Version<br><br>Exercise caution when taking these, I firmly believe they=
 are close to the claimed 300mics rating, Lots of strong OEVs and CEVs, at=
 times could not stop laughing for what seemed like hours (probably only 5=
 minutes), some scary moments as well, such as seeing people within your pe=
ripheral vision who are not actually there. A number of times had an eerie=
 feeling that a 3rd presence was in the room with us.. Trip lasted well pas=
t 12 hour and kept going strong until around 10 hours later, with around 75=
% of the effect still there after 10 hours. After some attempt at sleep (we=
 had a bit of meth after Lucy left the building), around 18 hours later my=
 partner could still see some fleeting OEVs and CEVs albeit quite tame and=
 far in between.<br>We both found body load to be quite strong on these as=
 well, halfway through the trip my stomach became sore and I was a bit naus=
eous, although nothing severe as to ruin the whole experience.<br>The conce=
pt of time was severly warped in this trip. 15 minute gaps in my journal en=
try seemed like 2 hours to us. We kept getting lost in micro-trips either=
 together or individualy and after what truely seemed like years, realised=
 that only a couple of minutes had passed.<br>Despite getting quite lost in=
 this trip, I had 3 points that I maintained front of mind, no matter how=
 warped the mind was at the time: My partner's safety, the volume on the st=
ereo (sensitive neighbours), and making sure we keep hydrated and attend to=
 bathroom duties in the bathroom, and not on my rug. All 3 points were alwa=
ys adhered to which at the same time gave me confidence that no matter how=
 deep I was in this trip, it was one I could jump out of at any time should=
 things turn sour. Throughout the trip there were several introspective mom=
ents which had me questioning many of my decisions in life, however that "e=
go loss" moment was never reached this time.<br><br>All in all a great expe=
rience, next time I believe I'll exercise more caution with these and maybe=
 have 2/3 of a tab.<br><br>Long Version (apologies for the rambling - a bit=
 amped up at the moment)<br><br>Background:<br>I have tripped once before=
 with my partner where we both had 1,5 of Johnnydeal's Krishnas and e both=
 enjoyedt this trip from what appeared to be quality clean LSD - referencin=
g other more experienced LSD users here on the forums, estimate for the Kri=
shnas is 100 - 150mics.<br>Both of us have tripped on 2-CB a number of time=
s<br><br>Maya(n)s:<br><br>This review will be mostly comparative to the Kri=
shnas.<br>Morning started with a healthy breakfast together with a dose of=
 multivitamins.<br><br>Setting:: My apartment - comfy place with lots of co=
lour and soft rugs etc... A place where we commonly enjoy various substance=
s. Trance music (deeper heavy stuff, only a bit of uplifting) on the stereo=
 and a nice trippy visualisation on the TV. Going outside to the park nearb=
y was on the cards prior to starting the trip, however given how strong it=
 was, we're glad we stayed in the safety of the appartment.<br>Due to the=
 strength of these tabs, details of the trip will be pretty vague, although=
 I did my best to keep a journal of sorts, although reading the entries a=
 day later certainly makes me wonder what planet I was on. Below is a timel=
ine based on my translation of my journal and reminiscing about the trip wi=
th my partner the day after.<br><br>2PM - put 1 tab each under the tongue<b=
r>2:20PM - chew up the tab and swallow it. By this time we are already both=
 feeling the effects. At this point they are fairly mild, although definate=
ly present and growing in intensity by the minute.<br>2:35PM - Visuals have=
 intensified a great deal, objects that have patterns are now visually vibr=
ating. The apartment appears to be partially a boat and partially submerged=
 under water. The folicles on my shaggy rug are swaying as if under water,=
 and when my partner needs to go to the bathroom, her reluctance to travel=
 the 20m morphes the tiles in the kitchen to sea water and the couches to=
 mountains. My shaggy rug has grown very long grass.<br>The paper I'm writi=
ng this down on is melting which is making it very difficult to continue wr=
iting anything meaningful...<br>We are astonished that only 15 minutes has=
 passed since the previous entry while to us it seemed more like an hour.<b=
r>An abstract painting my partner painted of a human eye with a tear under=
 it has come alive. The pupil in this painting is a vertex and it is curren=
tly spinning as if sucking me in. Throughout the trip this painting takes=
 on multiple colours, and its expression seem to mirror the emotions felt=
 by me at the time that I look at it. This painting has special meaning to=
 both my partner and I and it is almost as if it's a reflection of what I=
 feel. Fascinating.<br>2:50PM - Body load has appeared and initially are qu=
ite strong. We feel like we have melted to the floor/rug and cannot move (t=
his melting has of course occured while we're also under water lol).<br>My=
 partner finds it increasingly difficult to look at my face as I now resemb=
le something out of "Lolcats" - ie Oversized eyes and unproportioned facial=
 features.<br>3:05PM - Construction noises from a building nearby are scari=
ng the crap out of us, can actually see the sound waves travelling through=
 the air. Really strong taste of metal/something unidentifable in the mouth=
. Sometimes feels like the roof of the mouth is melting in strips, and our=
 mouthes feel like they're filled with hair, although upon inspect it's yet=
 another trick Lucy's played on us. Music playing is now distorting noticea=
bly, but the distortions improve the music for us at this point.<br>3:15PM=
 - After around 45 minutes, I manage to prepare a shisha (hookah) for us.=
 A process that normally takes me no more than 10 minutes - should have pre=
pared this earlier.<br>The smoke creates a welcome focal point that I often=
 used to sort of snap out of mini-trips. Prior to starting to smoke the shi=
sha, I drank a blackcurrant Powerade. Despite the shisha tobacco being stro=
ngly cherry flavoured, the smoke tasted exactly like the blackcurrent Power=
ade and had the odd texture combination of liquid and gas that was at the=
 same time melting in plank-like shapes.<br>3:30PM - For those that know th=
is track - Ellrich and Plaice - Fucking Society (Ummet Ozcan remix) comes=
 on. Simple yet powerful lyrics really resonate and somewhat freak us out=
 in a fun way.<br>4:00PM - Despite all other visuals being smooth and at th=
e standard frame-rate that human eyes see, shisha smoke blown out was fragm=
ented. As if I was watching a movie of smoke that was 1/3 or 1/4 frame rate=
 of real life. The same effect did not occur to cigarettes that my partner=
 (and sometimes I) smoked throughout the day.<br>Trees in the park nearby=
 (visible from our balcony) are pulsating with varying shades of green. Sta=
ring at one tree for a few seconds seems to create an image of a Treeant fr=
om Lord of the Rings, however when I focus on this Treeant, I realise it's=
 just a number of darker trees at different distances from us.<br>My partne=
r was convinced that this park was in fact the jungle and we were already=
 in it. A number of regular birds (magpies, etc) were flying around the bui=
ldings nearby, however they looked like birds of paradise to my partner.<br=
>4:15PM - My entry in the journal: "Reality is warped", I can only speculat=
e here, but I'm pretty sure while I recognised every object in the room to=
 be exactly that, if I looked at any stationary object for more than a seco=
nd, layer after layer of different patterns appeared over the top at which=
 point I struggled with the concept of our location.<br>My partner's heavy=
 body load seems to have lifted and with that her mood somewhat, although=
 it was never negative in the first place aside from being somewhat annoyed=
 at all the water around us and her having to walk on cliff edges.<br>While=
 my partner is in the bathroom, I stand outside of it in the bedroom to mak=
e sure she's ok. I stand still and just concentrate on one spot on the bed.=
 Within seconds layers upon layers of patterns superimpose on the objects=
 in the room and on each other. After some time I start to feel like I am=
 enveloped in the patterns as if combined they have created a very thick he=
avy fog in the bedroom. I am able to taste and actually bite this smoke/fog=
 although there is no taste. My partner snaps me out of this as she gets co=
ncerned with me standing still.<br>I then sit down near the bathroom door=
 with a turned off floor-standing fan next to me. I immediately begin getti=
ng bad and hostile vibes from the fan which makes me anxious and concerned=
 for my safety - it still looks like the same fan, no visual changes, just=
 a perception change. Amazed at this I get up and get away from the fan.<br=
>4:40PM - Shisha smoke starting to behave somewhat sentient. At one point=
 after I blew out a lung full (I usually create a lot of smoke with my shis=
ha draws), the smoke gathered together in one spot and held there for 30 se=
conds (impossible as this was near the open balcony door and it was windy=
 outside). I then looked at this oddity and without really identifying an=
 entity, I felt somewhat threatened by it: perhaps my mind telling me that=
 shisha smoke is still pretty bad for me lol.<br>Most of the other times wh=
en I blow the smoke out, it tends to separate into individual RGB clouds on=
ly slightly out of phaze with each other.<br>Some objects, such as candles=
 are now appearing heavily pixalated - perhaps brought on by a similar effe=
ct on the randomly generated music visualisation (G-Force).<br>5:00PM - Alw=
ays curious at the mirror/doorway phenomenon LSD trippers have reported, I=
 go to the full length mirror in my bedroom. Both the previous and this tim=
e on acid, my face - specifically my eyes really give me an odd feeling of:=
 This is the face of "LSD wisdom". Hard to put into words, however the gene=
ral feeling I have on my interpretation of this appearance is that as if ac=
id is telling me "This is the real deal, I am the "god" of the drug kingdom=
 and all the other drugs (eg mdma, meth, etc) are simply failed attempts to=
 reach acid's greatness. Pupils while dialated, are not as extreme as on MD=
 or Meth/Amph.<br>Around this time (possibly earlier) I start to feel quite=
 nausious, the feeling is quite odd and not the usual nausiousness. Have be=
en drinking heaps of water and powerade, so we're both hydrated.<br>All of=
 our senses appear to blend in with each other - I can taste the music, hea=
r the colours, etc.<br>Eating some ice cream now - hard to imagine anything=
 tasting better right now!<br>5:30PM - The actual concept of a concept for=
 anything seems far beyond our understanding.<br>Despite having drunk possi=
bly 2 - 3 litres of water and powerade, I have not been able to urinate, al=
though my partner has not had any issues there (aside from the perilious se=
a that needs to be crossed in order to get to the toilet. Once in the toile=
t, my partner has to hold onto something as the toilet is swaying very stro=
ngly as if it's a small boat in rough seas.<br>Black marks on the floor in=
 the toilet at first appear to be spiders to my partner which cause a mini-=
freak out. Once I have calmed my partner down, all is well. Tiles in the ba=
throom are constantly changing size and different colours are washing over=
 them - pretty standard for most things in the apartment though throughout=
 the trip.<br>Leading on the wash basin to wash my face bring all sorts of=
 new challenges - the ceramic bowl is now made of something very soft and=
 leaning on it makes me very unstable as I feel I am getting closer to the=
 floor.<br>6:30PM - Feels like the strong body load and somewhat overwhelmi=
ng visuals - which I just could not put on paper or recall today, has subsi=
ded. Just as I write this entry, I can feel it all coming back in a strong=
 wave. The feeling is that acid is playing with us.<br>While we're able to=
 maintain some sort of a concentration My partner and I discuss the acid's=
 behaviour. Seems like when we finally think we have figured out a specific=
 illusion or sitation, the Acid takes us to another dimension (same appartm=
ent though) where that illusion or situation no longer makes sense. Seems=
 impossible to get any kind of control, although I find it helpful to assig=
n missions to myself - ie. prepare a new shisha, get water ( what seems to=
 be a lengthy and dangerous trip to the fridge 5m away), etc. So while I co=
ntinue to trip balls heavily, I can also concentrate on a specific task whi=
ch helps me to lift myself out of the fog for a little while.<br>I make the=
 decision to try to throw up in an attempt to help my nausea. I get down on=
 my knees in preparation to ride the porcelain express and start to get the=
 feelings in my insides that I normally get prior to throwing up. As I am=
 staring into the toilet bowl, it appears to be trying to swallow me up eve=
n though I am bracing against it with my arms. After much dry-reaching thro=
w up attempt failed. Back to the mayhem in the lounge room - everything is=
 multi-coloured and given that I can taste these colours, I get quite a str=
ong odd taste in my mouth as soon as I enter the room.<br>When my partner=
 tries to combat nausea in the same way, the toilet bowl tried to suck my=
 partner in with a vortex instead. This proved to be too distracting - anot=
her failed attempt to throw up. Looks like the acid is with us for the long=
 haul, body load and all.<br>7:00PM - We fool around a bit and everything=
 feels very sensual. Although neither of us even thought about sex while tr=
ipping so far with so much going on, all of a sudden we want nothing else=
 but that. I won't go into detail here, but every tactile feeling was enhan=
ced and echoed throughout the other senses - hard to explain, but to do wit=
h the senses blending.<br>8:00PM+ - No more journal entries, very hard for=
 either of us to recall what transpired here, I remember heating up a nouri=
shing soup that I had ready, and while hunger has come and gone throughout=
 the trip, we are not hungry at this point. A few season 7 American Dad epi=
sodes are played here during cooking and attempts at eating, and besides th=
e standard warping of colours and shapes in the cartoon, the overall concep=
t of each episode as well as the "edginess" of the character's responses to=
 certain situations seem very extreme. We are not sure whether it's acid,=
 or the new episodes are really like that. Eventually we both finish the so=
up, and while neither of us was hungry, at no point did we feel like we did=
n't want to eat the soup. It seems to have helped with my stomach as well.<=
br>Midnight - Most of the effects have toned down and while they are still=
 present, they are manageable and feel lighter.

 yea the blotters were more bitter than the krishnas although it was hard=

re involved trips, mainly wanting to have a few ones first where we sort of=
 jump into it and see where it takes us. What I was referring to as bodyloa=
d was in fact the physical effects that we were feeling experiencing than=
 ones that were I suppose mentally induced, such as stomach pains=C2=B8 per=
iods where body temps rose and then fell back to normal, the feeling of pre=
ssure in our jaw muscles - something you'd experience on md etc, and so on.=
.<br>I'm very interested though to understand what part of my trip you thin=

 - By around 1am (11 hours after eating blotters) I can confidentally say=
 there was only the rare visual or some distortions.. The experiences we ha=
d 17 or 18 hours after eating the blotters were very rare and fleeting...=
 eg. I would be convinced I saw a trailer when something moved off the cent=
re of my view, however when I looked at or around that movement afterwards,=
 no more trails were to be found... My inexperienced guess would be that th=
ese post-effects were the brain's way of dealing with the much higher stren=

 would have posted a quick review somewhere in this thread, however it woul=

 like DOI to me. A lot of people that i know=C2=A0 gave a trip report like=
 this when taken it for the first time. <br>But i guess there will be more=

				@ HC:<br><br>What you quoted doesn't make it sound any less like LSD to=
 me...<br><br>I think you are forgetting that qetuoljgdaxvn reported that=
 he had smoked meth after coming down from the acid. He even admitted that=
 what he reported experiencing at the 17 and 18-hour marks were just "fleet=
ing" things, so I wouldn't pay much attention to this. <br><br>I think his=
 trip report is just convoluted due to the meth intake after coming down fr=
om acid.<br><br>As for the other aspects of his report that are questionabl=
e: A lot of tabs taste bitter even though they are genuine LSD. It can be=
 the ink from printing a full-scale colour graphic on the blotter. I myself=
 experience hideous bodyload on acid, because I generally don't eat well or=
 sleep well and am not particularly healthy. So that doesn't necessarily me=
an it's a DOx, but more my own body's reaction to a drug that makes me feel=
 exhausted.<br><br>I know you are worried 'cos you've said in other threads=
 that you only know the Mayan Calendar blotter print to be DOI, which is fa=
ir enough, but there are a lot of other glowing reviews of this print float=
ing around on the Internet (check the OVDB section and Bluelight). I guess=
 we won't truly know until we sample the Mayas ourselves.<br><br>Please, th=
ough, let's refrain from having a repeat of like what anon911 did to Tony76=
 here. The fact is, you won't know whether it's LSD vs. a research chemical=
 until you try it for yourself. Trip reports and reviews are so subjective.=
 Personally, I find it hard to believe that a seller like juergen2001 would=
 sell fake acid. I am yet to sample them for myself, but I have hope for th=
ese blotters!!!

				Yes unfortunately the after effects would have been quite impacted by=
 the meth...<br>As much as I would have loved to just stick to this acid ta=
b and ride it out to the end with no interference from other drugs, I haven=
't seen my partner for a while, and won't be for a while longer, so a 2-3=
 day binge of acid. followed by meth helped to make our time more memorable=
.<br><br>24 hours after posting my review my partner and I came to the conc=
lusion that most. if not all, of these light hallucinations must have been=
 caused by meth.. I won't go into too much detail about the meth, however=
 both of us are quite new to it as well and ended up taking larger doses ov=
er this time than previously... around 300mgs between the 2 of us over a 48=
 hour period (which is probably not even that much for experienced users,=
 but clearly had a strong effect on us especially since it's very pure stuf=
f from SR).<br><br>The main reason we think these after effect hallucinatio=
ns were caused by meth was due to the nature of them. Mainly it was a sort=
 of smoky fog/grainy "noise" that appeared to overlay our vision. My partne=
r's vivid imagination turned this noise into little stick figure men walkin=
g around on walls and tiny insects on arms etc. This, followed by somewhat=
 itchy skin makes me think it's caused by meth. Us being aware of these typ=
e of meth effects gave us some control over it and while it was difficult=
 to make these visuals disappear, we were certainly aware enough not to scr=
atch holes into our skin.<br><br>Really looking forward to these being revi=
ewed by others, and here's hoping that these are indeed LSD - they were cer=
tainly convincing enough to me!

				Hey everyone, as promised is my review of Juergen's Mayans.<br><br>Its=
 now T+10:30 and I've just finished a very entertaining run through of Ingl=
orious Basterds, a nice change from Apocalypse Now which is the norm on the=
 come down for me.<br><br>Before i get into the details I'll start with the=
 basics<br><br>A) Its not DOI, as far from it as possible. Quite simply the=
 best LSD I've ever had.<br>B) 300mg? I really cant be sure, but it was fuc=
king powerful to say the least. I ended up having two myself and was totall=
y blown away. I took the second one after an hour and it took me to a whole=
 new level.<br><br>I've had a fair bit of LSD in my time and nothing has co=
me close to this. 3 weeks ago I did 3 of freedompeople's avatars and had an=
 amazing experience. But it doesn't even compare to this.<br><br>Myself and=
 my best friend dropped around 10pm looking forward to an interesting night=
 ahead. The effects were noticeable within 10 minutes as my body recognised=
 that this was a fair amount of acid. The first thing I noticed is that the=
re was no upset stomach, nothing even the slightest bit uncomfortable. Juer=
gen advertised this as very pure LSD and he was not lying. It was such a br=
illiant come up that it tuned our moods perfectly for the night ahead.<br><=
br>After the first hour we were both well into it, It was already better th=
an my experience with the 3 avatars, so I decided to have another. It turne=
d out to be the best decision of the night.<br><br>The second best decision=
 came some 30 minutes later when we decided to take a walk around the neigh=
bourhood. We started off down the street an spent a good 15 minutes looking=
 at the moon behind the clouds, it actually looked like the apocalypse, the=
 end of the world never looked so beautiful.<br><br>After spending a good=
 20 minutes at a Church (a lot of fun) we walked through the streets apprec=
iating the visuals, and there were many. We decided against a walk into the=
 park lands surrounding the city and headed back home for a pit stop. We dr=
ank up, had a bit of chocolate and continued on.<br><br>I should mention th=
at this was about T+2:30, and never before would I have had anything but dr=
ink by this time, but our stomachs felt fantastic.<br><br>On the second tri=
p outside we ended up at a sporting oval, with huge grandstands around the=
 edge. Here, my friends, I had what amounts to the best and most pleasurabl=
e experience of my life. I don't know what it was, maybe the second tab ful=
ly kicking in, but I couldn=E2=80=99t not fathom how much pleasure I was fe=
eling. Fuck mdma, doi, 2c whatever. They don't even compare to what this fe=
lt like. I was just having a mental orgasm over and over and over I never=
 wanted it to stop.<br><br>Over the following 2 hours we ended up having a=
 massive discussion into our lives that reached the levels I only previousl=
y=C2=A0 read about others having with LSD. This was a life changing trip,=
 and one of the most therapeutic experiences of my life.<br><br>Eventually=
 around T+5:30 we headed on home as it was about 3:30am and it was quite co=
ld outside. The whole way back the visuals were brilliant, at one stage we=
 were stood outside of a Map shop captivated by a picture of Australia. It=
 was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'm actually going to go back=
 there later today to buy the picture.<br><br>Now its T+11:00 and I've stil=
l got some visuals. It's still hard to focus and the text is moving as I'm=
 doing this, but nothing like before. I feel fucking fantastic.<br><br>I'd=
 had high expectations ordering from Juergen, and I was not let down. I cou=
ldn't have imagined Id ever in my life feel that amount of pleasure and suc=
h a great sense of well being at any one time. Between T+3:00 to T+5:30 the=
 feelings I was getting I cant even put into words. I want to put this shit=
 in the fucking water supply of the world and give everyone a chance to fee=
l this.<br><br>So once again, 300mg? Its had to say, 3 weeks ago I had the=
 3 avatars but they weren't even in the same league. It was just so intense=
 and so pure. Everything about the whole night bled purity.<br><br>And with=
 that brothers, I feel cleansed.<br><br>Cheers Juergen for taking my mind=
 to a level that id spend many years taking a lot of drugs hoping that one=
 day i'd get to. I found my holy grail, and with it had the BEST NIGHT OF=
 MY FUCKING LIFE.<br><br>Enjoy.

				Sorry for the delay, but here's my review of the Mayans. I'm not too go=
od at reviews but I'll at least say this: best trip of my freaking life. It=
 was me and two friends and a sitter (and damn was he a good sitter). We to=
ok one tab each and started to come up after just under a half hour. I usua=
lly just have visuals, but last night was the first time I started to lose=
 touch with reality, but in a good way. At one point I was inside my own co=
nsciousness, and there were certain points where if you'd asked me my own=
 name I wouldn't have been able to tell you. Luckily our sitter kept us all=
 sane, and I ended up feeling every emotion possible throughout the night.=
 Excellent experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to get them again.

 a few times, shrooms once and ketamine/DXM maybe 20 times in total so my=
 experience with psychedelics and dissociatives isn't that big.<br><br>I'm=
 21 years old and still living at my parents house for some reason, mainly=
 due to my workplace being near by - no point to really move out. Because=
 of this, I sometimes have problems doing drugs as my parents definitely ha=
ve gotten all that stuff they teach in school stuffed to their heads. Becau=
se of this, especially on drugs like L, I'm sometimes scared of having bad=
 vibes due to stressing about "getting caught" or something like that.<br><=
br>Anyways, I took a 3/4 tab, supposedly 225 =C2=B5g whereas usually I have=
 taken a dose of 100-200=C2=B5g atleast according to what the vendors have=
 said. 1-2 of 100 =C2=B5g tabs.<br><br>Around 4 pm I dosed up and it took=
 unusually long for it to hit - usually I have started getting the feeling=
 of it coming up around 20 minutes later but this time, I think it was arou=
nd 5:15 I started to feel the L kicking in.<br>For a few hours I had the sa=
me nice high I've always had when using L - kind of like drunkyness but thi=
nking is still possible. Around 9 pm orso I felt that I really need to smok=
e a bowl, since I've noticed that it changes the L in a nice way - vision=
 getting more circular, colors turning red and so on. Everything became slo=
wer and started to pulsate more.<br><br>Around 30 minutes after smoking tho=
ugh, I got quite scared. I couldn't feel my mouth anymore and had to take=
 a ice cream just so that I would know where my mouth is. Everything seemed=
 to melt together and I thought I was going mad. It felt like a ship was ab=
out to leave inside my head and I had to choice to either catch it fight ag=
ainst it.<br><br>Anyways, after some time I managed to hop on the ship and=
 after that, I understood what the word "tripping" actually means. Can't re=
ally remember my thoughts while on the peak but definitely I understood som=
e very deep and important questions which I've been wondering about for a=
 long time.<br><br>It felt like I had ascended on a higher level - like the=
re was a big highway of data all around me and I solved some of the mankind=
s biggest problems.<br><br>At maybe 10:30 pm orso I remembered that I haven=
't gone for a walk with my dog for like 8 hours. I decided to go out for a=
 bit. I put on my headphones and some music from my phone and I understood=
 how great music really is. I mean, with speakers, it has always sounded re=
ally great on L too, like, you can analyze and feel every note, every secon=
d in the song but with headphones, it became.. Even better. Probably becaus=
e the sound is coming straight to your ears I guess?<br>It might also been=
 because of the music that played. I'm a pretty big animefag and like japan=
ese music, but when doing drugs, I usually prefer something like Animal Col=
lective, Earth and other music that fit well with drugs. The song in questi=
on was Lisa - God Only Knows by the way, a track that changes a lot, goes=
 down and gets very massive at some points and so on.<br><br>While walking=
 around, even though nervous about cars headlights flashing around, I reall=
y felt invicible - like a god. I understood how great it is to be outside=
 on L - usually I have just stayed inside due to my usual "fear" of other=
 people.<br><br>It also felt like my dog had changed somehow. It has never=
 been so lively, playing around in the snow and stuff like that. It felt li=
ke there was some kind of spiritual connection between me, my dog and the=
 nature.<br><br>After walking around a while, I decided it's better to go=
 back home. There were drunk people wandering around after all and although=
 I wasn't as scared as I thought I'd be, being high and all, I still wanted=
 to go back to safety of my cave.<br><br>After that, I felt like the high=
 was wearing off again, so I decided to smoke another bowl. I also took a=
 small hit of Ketamine, only like 0.03 orso. I thought it'd be better to no=
t dose too much since I was pretty wasted from L and weed anyways. Thinking=
 back, I guess it was pointless to do the K anyways, considering that I had=
 done it for a few days straight with total doses on 0.2-0.5mg per day, so=
 there probably was some tolerance built up already.<br>Atleast I don't thi=
nk I was able to feel the K in all of that L / weed high, apart from that=
 lovely feeling when it drips from your nose to mouth.<br><br>Due to smokin=
g, that feeling of melting, everything being circular and red came back. Ag=
ain, I can't remember very well what were my thoughts for the next few hour=
s. Actually, it might've been only 20 minutes orso too, but atleast it felt=
 like hours.<br><br>Every once in a while, I got the urge to go back outsid=
e, to the balcony. It was just somehow so damn cool to be outside, watch th=
e snow glittering and smoking a cig with my headphones on. Like I said, hea=
dphones, even though they're some crappy ones whereas my speakers are quite=
 costy ones, felt just so much better for some reason. I decided that when=
 summer comes, I'm definitely taking a few days off and going to my summer=
 resort. There I'll sit on the beach, chain smoke cigs and just watch the=
 beautiful nature.<br><br>It took me till 8 am orso to get asleep. At that=
 point, I still felt the afterglow pretty strongly, there were some mild vi=
suals but nothing too much. In fact, I think this night I had less visuals=
 than usually. Or well, I'm not sure. While in toilet, it looked as if the=
 floor was wet and most of the time, things were pulsating, but the colors=
 weren't as sharp as usually.<br><br>Next day, after 10 hours of sleep, I=
 totally felt like reborn. I smoked a bowl and got pretty high - a lot high=
er than usually from that amount. I didn't start tripping again from smokin=
g but it was still quite nice. Just wanted to see what would happen as I've=
 heard that some people start tripping again day after L by smoking some.</=
blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botslice_quote"></div><=
/div><br><br>What can I say.. I came to understand psychedelics on a differ=

 somehow easier and more interesting now. I guess I'll go for the lower dos=

				Quick review on the "Mayas" or as someone has corrected - the Aztecs.<b=
r><br>I reviewed a whole Aztec before - strong yet awesome trip... a couple=
 of nights ago my partner and I decided to eat half a tab each - more of a=
 recreational dose we thought..<br>Turned out to be quite right, it seemed=
 a more "fun" trip rather than the deep trip we experienced on a whole tab.=
 I'd compare it to a trip I had on 1.5 Krishnas a couple of months ago whic=
h are rated at 100 each, so 300 for these Aztecs seem quite accurate...<br>=
<br>Anyways there was heaps of the usual visual distortions, but this time=
 around a lot more auditory distortions which were quite freaky but interes=
ting! In particular, we had some movies going at low volume while at higher=
 volume playing some good deep trance - the trance always sounded great, no=
 distortions, yet the talking and music in the movies often sounded very mu=
ch slowed down or chipmunk talk WHILE the trance music was spot on! Had the=
 best fun playing with a remote control helicopter - one of those cheap yet=
 fairly high quality ones about 15cm long with lots of lights... the thing=
 looked like a living reptile but somehow my control skills were amazing!<b=
r><br>Lastly, unlike our previous trips, this one was very sexual with my=
 partner and there was a LOT of very enjoyable playing around and intercour=
se :)<br><br>I'm gona hold onto these Aztecs for as long as I have! Still=
 have 7...

				I've been further at testing this 1gram of MDMA he has sent me and it=
 appears to be a few little MDMA crystals cut with speed paste.<br><br>I'd=
 say around 30-40% MDMA and the rest of it is speed which is also cut with=
 oil to make it weigh more.<br><br>After drying it out. 1 gram became 700mg=
. That would still be OK but not if it's cut with speed.<br><br>I'd rather=
 get 200mg of pure MDMA than 700mg MDMA+SPEED. I paid for something, I expe=
ct to get what I paid for. <br><br>I will continue throwing dirt at him unt=
il he gives me my money back or reships some high quality crystal MDMA. Not=
 this stuff.<br><br>He still, for 2 days, has not been answering my PM's.=
 If he continues to do this, I will definitely not buy anything else from=
 him. It's a shame because I wanted to try some of his other drugs... But=
 if all he cares is about money and not his customers. Screw it. <br><br>Yo=
u guys want to see why I'm so pissed off and what you will get if you order=
 MDMA from juergen?<br>You will get this shit:<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/C0=
DXd.jpg?1<br>http://i.imgur.com/TpJGk.jpg?1<br><br>The whiter stuff is just=
 chopped up crystal/paste, and the brown stuff is the state of the "MDMA",=
 it's exactly how I got it.<br>There are small crystals, as I said, that ar=
e covered in a paste that resembles ear wax.<br><br>Best quality? I don't=
 think so.

				Disappointed with Juergens Mayas. I bought 25 of them, dropped 3 last=
 night expending to go see the maker of my universe expecting at least a 70=
0-800ug trip. I experienced about a 350-450ug trip. I have much experience=
 with LSD and they were no more than 150ug each.. If he doesn't compensate=
 for my losses I definitely will not be buying LSD from him again. And appa=
rently the MDMA I ordered from his is cut with speed paste and oil. I compa=
red my MDMA with pictures of someone who knew and claimed that and it looke=
d the same. Not satisfied with this seller.

				Ok. Juergen replied to my message. He says that's his current batch (th=
e oily MDMA) and that everybody else was very happy with it.<br><br>I will=
 be honest and say I didn't actually TEST it to see if it has or hasn't got=
 speed in it.<br><br>I just assumed, by the looks of it, and I saw, there=
 are quite a few crystals, but they are surrounded by an oily substance. Mo=
st likely sassfrass oil. Sassfrass oil is used to synthesize MDMA and it se=
ems the person who cooked juergen's MDMA was too lazy to do an acetone wash=
 to remove organic materials so as to leave the dry ionic compound. That's=
 not much of a problem... <br><br>Maybe the oil adds... 0.1-0.2 grams to th=
e weight. So at best, I just lost 100 mg's.<br><br>I just gave 120mg's to=
 a friend to test it, somebody else is testing it with a testing kit.<br><b=
r>I will leave a real review on juergen's MDMA this weekend, to see if it's=
 really good or bad.<br><br>I may have been too hasty with my judgement, th=
is was because I haven't rolled in a LONG time and all I've seen on the str=
eets was shit.<br><br>One more thing. I recommend everybody who got this oi=
ly MDMA of juergen's, do an acetone wash on it yourself. Sassfrass oil is=
 toxic, you don't want to ingest that shit. Don't worry, it's not enough to=
 kill you or make you sick, but just so you're 100% sure.. It's useless any=
way.

				Did you ever buy a custom order? The order gets pulled out as soon as=

				His MDMA? I took some 2 days ago, sadly it was on the spur of the momen=
t so we hadn't planned it. We took it at 2 AM, and by the time it kicked in=
 at 3:30 AM we were seriously fucked up. The cab rider was doing 140km/h th=
rough the city cause I just told him there would be some extra money in the=
re if he went faster, we were trying to find a club that was open.... we di=
dn't find no clubs to go to and no hookers either and we just raved at my=
 house, it was the first and probably last time that I rolled in such a sma=

 carpets and dancing in the mirror thinking I was the image of god. Then I=
 got out of the house and I was saying hello to everybody on the street and=
 trying to start a conversation with anyone who I saw. The empathy and love=
 was overwhelming. It's not bunk.

				I'm no expert on MDMA quality as I have only tripped once before from=
 another vendor in here back in the day located in the US (NextDayAir) whic=
h was absolutely great quality. I can say that 80mg of juergen's new batch=
 felt extremely clean like the MDMA I got from NextDayAir. It does look coo=
kie-dough like as deliric says. Brown, a bit oily. Not sure what it is cut=
 with, hopefully not anything toxic. <br><br>Either way, it was a great hig=
h (even with such a low dose), no physical side-effects at all, just euphor=
ia, great mood, some energy boost in the beginning, then around the 4 hour=
 mark just calm, content and a serene feeling. No side-effects at all. Had=
 to pop .5mg alprazolam (Xanax) to fall asleep though, but that's really no=
 big deal. I wasn't hyper or anything during the latter parts of the trip.=
 I went outside to look at stars at one point and it was absolutely wonderf=
ul and beautiful. Music sounded absolutely amazing (as it should). Interper=
sonal communication was excellent and clean.<br><br>All in all, a very grea=
t batch to a very good price. Arrived very quickly (3 days after ordering)=
 with great packaging.<br><br>Thank you juergen!

				Hmm.. I am surprised about any negative reviews with Juergen. My dealin=
gs with him have been all good. Why?<br><br>(a) He replies to most of his=
 messages if you ask the correct question that an answer can't be found on=
 the forums. If you ask stupid questions, don't expect an anwser.<br>(b) He=
 is interested in how/when it arrives.<br>(c) His packaging is by far the=
 best on SR. I am not going to say what it is but lets just say he has had=
 a good think about the statistical probability of interception.<br><br>100=
% hit rate so far for me. but given this game... I can't keep expecting suc=
h good numbers. But he is the best it can get on here IMO.<br><br>The polis=
h speed paste is the bomb. half a gram of the stuff is enough to keep you=
 up for a long time. Just dry it up, either rinse it,=C2=A0 and have a few=
 lines, and cut it up with a razor blade. If you have a girl/boy partner..=
 it will turn you into one raving horny monkey on the come down ;).. which=
 is alot of fun now and=C2=A0 then. I mix mine 50/50 with glucose powder wh=
ich seems to work best with absorption than just straight lines of the stuf=
f.<br><br>I am not going to say where he sent it.. but I was at a a party=
 racking up a few lines for people and a girl said... 'you sure this is not=
 coke?' after having a nice line. So you get an idea of the quality and pow=
dery feel it has. I am just glad there is decent speed on SR.. compared to=
 the shit on the streets here it has by far the best health implication fro=
 a public health point of view.. (which is ironic that LE would like to shu=
t SR down when it is doing more for harm minimization than LE would ever re=
alize)<br><br>Now there seems to be a problem with stuff coming out of Germ=
any in the last month or so. I have had dealings with Pfandleiher and putti=
ng a few 2 and 2 together I think that Pf may have been profiled by German=
 LE. Alot of packages went missing (I would say all of them) that were sent=
 between June 29 and July 10. Too many to think that they were intercepted=
 on this side. MDMA is alot easier to pick up than speed by sniffer dogs..=
 Pf was getting sloppy, but I get the feeling that there is no such sloppin=
ess from Juergen. It just takes German LE some time and resources to put sn=
iffer dogs at the point of entry and boom... intercepted alot easier with=
 less resources than deployment of sniffer dogs at the point of exit. The=
 ocnnection between imprint and Pf is also noteworthy so.. who knows what=
 is going on.<br><br>Could this profiling be happening with Juergen? I don'=
t know.. but I doubt it.. I don't think he would be that stupid to put such=
 a large load through the point of entry on the German side... but there wa=
s one large burp in the German mail system in July... so if people are havi=
ng problems I would not place it as Juergens fault.. I have had enough posi=
tive dealings with him to see that the he/she is a business person.. (anyon=
e see the german connection in breaking bad?)<br><br>I haven't tried Juerge=
ns LSD yet but will be ordering some soon to give it a go. The fact that he=
 tries it himself, and makes his own blotters..for quality testing says alo=
t. <br><br>The MDMA coming out of Germany is really good so I expect Juerge=
ns to be the same. He also splits up the 15g+ speed orders into many packag=
es if anyone is wondering.

 a "blue psychedelic" picture look like? Is looking at the picture meant to=
 make you trip? I prefer to pay someone else for 100ug and get 100ug than=
 pay Juergen for 300ug and get 100ug. He is also asking everyone to finaliz=
e early currently, which is completely unnecessary given the amount of stuf=
f he is selling. Buyers should stop putting up with vendors asking for earl=
y finalization - it undermines the main safeguard that makes SR an effectiv=
e marketplace. He could close business at any time and run away with money=
 from probably 2 weeks worth of business.

				Just to add, I like to keep people informed.. <br><br>After about 10 mi=
nutes of writing the message I get a reply back asking for my city (fast cu=
stomer service so a definite +), he says he had problems sending out some=
 letters last week and he wants to see if mine was one... This concerns me=
 a bit only because he states FE is required, if you ask your buyers to FE.=
. you cannot then wait 7 days after taking payment to wait for them to cont=
act you so you can say that you are unable to ship.. ((IF this is the case)=
), it still may be that he has sent the package and that the post is late..=
 however it makes me anxious that another German package arrived today post=
ed after Juergen said he shipped.. <br><br>So, It may be all good, but I am=
 now a bit worried, he hasn=C2=B4t told me if mine was one of the letters=
 that didn't ship and I am still waiting for a reply... Hopefully he can so=
rt this out today and avoid me needing to transfer more bitcoins to my acco=
unt and purchasing elsewhere..<br><br>ACE

				It's my first post in the forums (lost login data of my old account a=
 while back) and I have never odered from Juergen, but 3 days ago I ordnere=
d some of his dalailamas to France. I finalized early like requested (well=
 ...) and nothing here yet, though that's still okay imo because mailing to=
 France can take several days. Hoping it will arrive on Saturday latest, wi=
ll keep you updated. Should I get it, I'll update about the quality as well=
.<br><br>However I did ask him a question after purchase and he didn't repl=

 distribution or center), because if they really hit that hard I might just=
 go for half.

				Hello everyone, I'm new on the forums and also a first time buyer. I or=
dered 2g of juergen2001's Polish speed (domestic in Germany) to test it and=
 then maybe get more from him. Now I just wanted to ask you what are your=
 experiences with his current domestic shipping and if there were complicat=
ions with his domestic shipping before? On his profile he says it would tak=
e 1 day if I order until 1PM on the day before. It's been 3 days now, he's=
 not even reading my pm's, he guaranteed(!) me that I'll receive it on Wedn=
esday and I unfortunately finalized early... I hope it's all good and that=
 I receive my order today (Friday). Next time I'll be more clever and try=
 to don't FE, if I don't receive the order or a message today I'll not buy=
 his stuff again. I just want to make authentic and smooth business and I=
 guess I can at least except a short reply when I FE.<br><br>Thanks for you=
 attention, I'll be glad for each answer and I wish you all a good day.<br>=

				I have purchased 1g of MDMA from juergen a few months ago without a pro=
blem. It wasn't the best quality but it was cheapest. A month ago I placed=
 two separate orders of 1g each to two different addresses and neither of=
 them arrived. Then a week after I placed those orders, I placed another or=
der for a gram to a third address which arrived in about a week.<br><br>I=
 am seriously confused now. Immediately after placing the first two orders,=
 I messaged juergen2001 to make sure he saw that they were to be shipped to=
 two different places. He responded three days later acknowledging that and=
 asked me to FE which I did.<br><br>Then, after placing the third order, I=
 messaged him to tell me to clarify the shipping instructions if needed as=
 they were a tad complicated. He did not respond to that message but he did=
 read it and that package did arrive after about two weeks.<br><br>I messag=
ed him after two weeks without receiving the first two orders, and then aga=
in the third week, and AGAIN today, a full month after I was asked to final=
ize. huergen2001 has not read any of those messages and has not gotten back=
 to me. I didn't think someone as popular as juergen2001 would selectively=
 scam... Stay far away from juergen2001<br><br>Oh and to back up my theory=
 that he selectively scams, one of those addresses has received no customs=
 letter and has actually received a separate order from Europe this past we=
ek.

				wow--what mixed reviews and sadly perhaps a downward trend from a long=
 time vendor who has added much joy to peoples lives. as a noob here i grat=
ified that he sent the order--or at least claimed to--lickety split--but co=
ncerned re the bait and switch--paying for 200 to 300 ug and getting 65, wh=
ich is a considerable difference and puts his prices per mic above even mat=
rix. Nonetheless keeping an open mind and again deeply appreciative--at lea=
st at this point that he took a chance on a newb first order guy--or maybe=
 seized the opportunity to jack me. Couple posts above is an allegation of=
 selective scamming--pardon the pun but this would be an acid test of such=
 allegations. Hoping all is well and i get the real deal--that would be so=

				It sounds like I've had a similar experience to others. First order was=
 great - fast shipping to Aus and a great product. Second order didn't arri=
ve (ordered over a month ago) and he hasn't responded to either of my two=
 messages (one 12 days ago, the latest 4 days ago). Pretty poor form. The=
 order not arriving is one thing, but to not respond to messages as well lo=
oks pretty bad, particularly when others have had the same experience. <br>=
<br>Surely it's less hassle to ship what's been ordered and build up good=

 re ship didn't come and after a few more messages he replied saying to sen=

 arrive if the last one didn't(I don't think he sent any of them) I said I=

ths ago in september. The paper was brownish to me. I ate two pieces thinki=
ng I would be fine and ended up having a scary trip. The pieces were a litt=
le bitter, so i was worried that they might not be real lsd, but I had read=
 somewhere that lsd can have a slight bitter taste if you eat a tab that ha=
s a lot of lsd on it and im pretty sure that 300 mics on one tab is a lot.=
 Anyway, those definately WERE the best tabs I've ever eaten. If you get th=
is guys acid, dont eat any more than one tab. Trust me. I ended up ordering=
 from juergen again about a month ago, and the 5 strip he sent me that time=
 was incredibly weak compared to the psycho demon tabs i got in september.=
 Juergen reshipped another 5 strip to me free of charge, but the next batch=
 he sent me was just as weak, if not weaker than the original. Definately=
 not 300 mics. I was hoping if anybody could tell me if they have gotten an=
y of juergens 300 mic lsd recently, and how strong do you think it was? If=
 you didn't have an intense strip from one tab, then they weren't 300 mics.=
 I didn't know much about LSD dosage when I first started using silk road,=
 but after eating two of juergens REAL 300 mic hits, I learned that no huma=
n should consume any more than 300 micrograms of LSD lightly like I did.

				Hello everyone,<br><br>As a first timer on SR, this vendor and LSD (5=
 Dalailama LSD-tickets (300=C2=B5g!!!!!)), and since I have no way to compa=
re them with anything else, I'd like to know, for those that have recently=
 tried, your opinion about them. At least, strong or weak those, if they're=
 the real thing.<br>The delivery was really fast and so far I can only tell=
 that I'm happy with him. He even shipped before I've FE and it was my firs=
t transaction (I FE when I got back home but he had already shipped it).<br=
><br>Regarding dosage he states on his product page that the 300ug are now=
 250ug and that he won't change product description to keep ratings/review.=
 It is, in my opinion totally acceptable. Maybe this 50ug difference is not=
iceable for those experience on the use of LSD.<br><br>So please, if someon=
e is on the mood for that, let me know if you have tried these pretty green=
 camel blotters recently and how was it.<br><br>Peace.

				To those of you who have tried out Juergen2001's latest batch of MDMA.=
 I've bought mdma a couple of times before and one time I was very satisfie=
d and one time not so much. See below please:<br><br>"One was very good; no=
t 'speedy' (you don't feel that you have to stand up and dance all the time=
), more loving, more euphoric, feels very good to sit or lie down, mellow=
 comedown and you don't get as fucked up as with the bad one. I guess this=
 one was pure mdma, nothing else. What do you think?<br>Regretfully the sel=
ler with this good stuff has left SR I think.<br><br>The other was not so=
 good; more 'speedy' (and you got more fucked up), felt more 'forced' and=
 less 'serene' and felt bad during the come down."<br><br>How would you des=
cribe this vendor's stuff?=20
