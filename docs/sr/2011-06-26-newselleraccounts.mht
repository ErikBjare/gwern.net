				I would suggest seeing the demand of new seller accounts. If there is=
 high demand for new seller accounts it may be good to allow more per perio=
d. This is after all a free market which probably would be bad to limit SR=
 to those who can afford to be in the vendor club.<br><br>The problems I co=
uld see arising would be vendors who can't pay up to join, and will try to=
 do deals outside of the system. It's not a good idea if you're a buyer, bu=
t if the vendor can provide a price point that is too good to pass up to th=
e buyer, they could circumvent the system. Just my $.02.<br><br>I do believ=
e it's good to limit the number of new vendors but you should definitely co=
nsider the demand for new seller accounts, and evaluate if changes need to=
 be made.<br><br>Keep up the good work SR.

				This is a good step.=C2=A0 L.E.'s main mechanism for getting involved=
 will be on the seller side, since the buyer side is the weakest in terms=
 of information.=C2=A0 Also it will discourage scammers from getting into=
 the game (although I'm sure it's already pretty hard to scam inside of the=
 escrow structure - any transaction outside of escrow has nothing to do wit=
h SR and the responsibility lies solely on the participants).<br><br>It wou=
ld also be interesting to see what the bidding is up to.=C2=A0 If a seller=
 is serious, he's not going to mind throwing down a few bitcoins to get int=
o the game and you are more likely to get sellers who have good sources (or=
 are their own source) providing services and products.=C2=A0 This will inc=
rease the overall quality of goods on SR, which is of course to the benefit=
 of the customers.<br><br>Bottom line - I like it!

				The way I see it, You arent able to provide the best product if you don=
't even have the money to pay for an account.<br>Not having money leads to=
 poor products, poor packaging, and less care. Someone who pays for an acco=

				To be honest I will not spend my bitcoins on an auction just to become=
 a seller here so I can be scammed further by having sent my product to fak=

				@JackDan<br><br>The unfortunate truth of the matter is that the "brick=

 entirely on the buyer.=C2=A0 Unless you are flashing a driver's license wh=

				I too hope that a referral system will be added as a way to gain a sell=
er account, because this auction system would be disappointing in itself.=
 It does seem to minimize the presence of scammers, especially if seller ac=
counts are lost by people who receive too high a proportion of complains,=
 but IMO enhances the presence of LE by relying completely on financial res=
ources and not on a network of trust. If the only sellers wanted here are=
 the biggest then I may as well sign out now. I don't plan to make my livin=
g by selling drugs, I just came here to sell a few obscure items I couldn't=
 safely offer otherwise, pick up a few items I haven't been offered before=
 and to see what might become of this novel new concept. Besides, my spendi=
ng money has been invested in RCs, not bitcoins, so I would have to sell to=
 buy a seller account. Maybe there needs to be another trading site for ord=
inary people like me. And I do see this as a trading site, since bitcoins=
 seem to be primarily FOR drugs, at least at this point.

				This is bullshit, so some of us already with accounts who were going to=

 every big seller will be law enforcment because they can afford to buy all=

 silk road making more money. <br><br>And what about sellers being scammed?=

				1 scammer can make 20 buyers account and make bogus buys, although if=
 the price is deducted from his account when placing an order sounds much=
 better, because every account will have to have some Bitcoins that will be=
 on hold during the whole transaction.<br>I overlooked this one before, but=
 still don't know if this is how it works on SR or not.<br><br>So the selle=
r can loose his product and postage cost every single time a transaction oc=
curs (I doubt that a seller will take the buyers reputation points into acc=
ount, because there are a lot of one time buyers and "one nick name for one=
 buy" buyers). Or he loose his reputation.<br>The buyer can loose an addres=
s if something goes wrong (fake seller, LE).=C2=A0 So what can the seller=
 do with an address that might be:<br>- completely fake (in case the scamme=
r's goal was to make the seller lose his product and postage cost)<br>- a=
 safe address (unlinked to the buyer)<br>- the buyers home<br><br>If there=
 was just a small amount for personal use, the fake seller or LE might have=
 opened a telephone book to point out a random address with much less effor=
t than faking sells on SR, he has about the same chance to find something=
 illegal in that random house he pointed at in the phone book, as in that=
 address he got from the buyer.<br><br>For bigger amounts nobody should use=
 his own address IMO, but that is obvious.

				Oh and guys i don't think you considered something, if you have to buy=
 an account you're no longer anonymous. When you purchase bitcoins you usua=

 what you buy with them, if it's a silk road account then you're screwed.=
 This is why bitcoin washing services exist, to disguise the connection bet=
ween the individual coins and what they are used for. <br><br>So buy your=
 bitcoins in cash, with disposable credit cards or something else. <br><br>=
This is a mistake silk road, and yeah i'm pissed cause i wanted to sell and=
 i have this kind of moral issue with buying an account to sell illegal shi=
t. You guys could of at least given all existing accounts the option of upg=
rading to sellers for free. <br><br>Oh and what if people buy accounts in=
 large quantities and resell them? The same person winning every 48 hours,=
 i'm guessing silk road won't give a fuck, they make money anyway lol

 them with an anonymous CC (prepaid gift card that requires no ID), or are=
 generating them via a mining program.=C2=A0 There are coin shuffling servi=

 it's virtually impossible to link the origin of the coins.=C2=A0 I believe=

 out with it.=C2=A0 As with everything else, I'm sure he's open to suggesti=
ons (he has an entire forum section devoted to that), so positive results=
 would probably be more attainable by stating the benefits of adding a serv=

><br>I think having an escrow fee on the buyer side makes sense=C2=A0 Even=
 15% or something just to tamp constant scamming.=C2=A0 A buyer rating syst=
em is ideal as well from a seller perspective, so that scammers can be flag=
ged asap and the community can know about it - other than that if you are=
 a seller and you have issues with a customer, post his username and your=
 story in the Rumor Mill section of the forum - sellers check there all the=
 time.<br><br>As to the risks - a seller can be out his product, sure (I'm=
 not mitigating the financial liability at all).=C2=A0 I'm just saying that=
 so far my experience has been solid so I dont' have to jack my prices up=
 to accomodate a 50% rip-off rate.=C2=A0 There is also arbitration whereby=
 SR will mediate a dispute.=C2=A0 If you are a reputable seller chances are=
 you are going to at least have your side of the story honestly considered.=
=C2=A0 This whole thing is a work and progress and it seems to be off the=
 ground solidly.=C2=A0 There will be many kinks along the way and that's no=
t counting personal security issues, just keep feeding in suggestions and=
 hopefully the good ones will be adopted over time and we can have an even=
 better, more secure and mutually-beneficial community than we do now.

				in my opinion, seller accounts should be bought for an expensive amount=
 (over a grand) ,and once they have proven themselves,they should be re-imb=

,but 500 bucks at least..or maybe seller accounts should just be bought wit=
hout re-imbursement....500 dollars a pop for a seller account....which is=
 peanuts for a drug dealer but alot for a scammer....make this place a bit=
 more upper class.lol<br><br>buyers should only be allowed escrow on there=
 2nd go with a verified supplier...but escrow compulsory for all new seller=
s from the 1st go...that will protect old time sellers/verified sellers fro=
m people that just want to get goods without paying...<br><br>so basically;=
<br><br>verified sellers-buyers entitled to escrow on second purchase onwar=
ds<br>new sellers-buyers entitled to escrow on first purchase onwards<br><b=
r>so new sellers will be most at risk of getting scammed but that will soon=
 subside once they have good feedback and get some rep behind them and move=
 onto the verified seller status

				Hi Everyone. <br><br>=C2=A0I'm new here, obviously... I just heard abou=
t SR today, and sought it out. How marvelous. I feel like this is Diagon Al=
ley in Harry Potter... OK, I'm actually older than 30, so don't go thinking=
 I'm some knucklehead teen. Anyway, I wanted to comment about this new auct=
ion to upgrade to a seller account.<br><br>=C2=A0As I see it, there are sev=
eral issues that are trying to be dealt with here.<br>1) trying to keep the=
 quality of goods for sale high, as opposed to having many sellers who are=
 pushing junk or worthless items, so as to attract more buyers because the=
 quality of the market here is high. <br>2) preventing a rapid surge of sel=
lers who flood the market, creating 'chaos' for buyers, increasing competit=
ion for sellers, driving down profit margins, which could discourage other=
 sellers from competing, and making it more difficult for buyers to ascerta=
in who are 'good' sellers since many of them may have little or no feedback=
. <br>3) encouraging sellers who would sell on SR for a while, as opposed=
 to the one-off seller who is here today, gone tomorrow, and contributes li=
ttle to the community. <br><br>I do not think that this should have any bea=
ring on trying to weed-out bogus sellers who are looking to con someone, fr=
om the legitimate sellers honestly looking to do business, because the buye=
rs are already protected by the escrow system. It would not be in the selle=
r's best interest to try to pull a fast one regardless of whether they have=
 paid to upgrade their account or whether they upgraded it for free. <br><b=
r>First, lets deal with the first point. I think that it is important that=
 the goods sold on SR be of a caliber that would attract people to shop her=
e. If a high percentage of the items for sale are believed to be low value,=
 questionable quality, or "junk" items, it will not be in the buyer's inter=
est to sift through the listings to find the few unique, rare, or high qual=
ity items available. I think that having a system in place, such as paying=
 to upgrade your account to sell, would do well to keep the quality of good=
s on SR high, which is in the buyer's best interests, as well as the intere=
st of the seller's who offer these quality, or difficult to obtain items.<b=
r><br>Second point: The fact that only one new seller is accepted every 24=
 hours means the community will grow slowly, and not spike with fly-by-nigh=
t sellers who may not be around to help SR grow in a month or two. I think=
 this is a good thing. But it also means that a potential seller might have=
 to wait several days to become a seller, which makes it more difficult to=
 become part of this system. So in addition to the 'auction' method for a=
 seller membership every 48 hours, I think it was a good idea to also have=
 the ability to just 'buy' a seller licensed account outright. I think that=
 the fact that you have to purchase the account upgrade will limit the grow=
th of sellers enough that there will not be a rapid influx of short-term se=
llers.<br><br>Now, about the last point. I think that while SR is still in=
 its infancy, it would be better to have committed sellers who build a good=
 reputation here over several transactions, rather than many sellers with=
 few transactions who perhaps have a brief history here before they disappe=
ar. To encourage that, I see how having a monetary contribution would mean=
 that a seller would have to conduct several transactions to make back thei=
r investment, encouraging long-term relationships. <br><br>But I think we'd=
 all agree it would be nice to see SR have MORE goods, not less, with MORE=
 variety and diversity, be it from sellers in different locations around th=
e globe, or in type of goods, or in quality of goods, or whatever. In order=
 for that to happen, there needs to be MORE sellers. And I think that stric=
tly speaking, the fact that one has to pay-to-play, so to speak, will turn=
 away a certain number of possible sellers just for the fact that you are=
 starting off at a loss before you even get going. <br><br>So let me introd=
uce a twist to the idea, and tell me what you think... the money you spend=
 to upgrade your account is refunded. It could be a nominal refund, on a pe=
r-transaction basis. For every satisfactory transaction, 1 BTC or 0.5 BTC=
 (whatever) is refunded. It could be that 100% of the original investment=
 is refunded, or it could be that only part of the total investment will be=
 refunded. That I'll leave up to the accountants of SR to decide how much=
 profit margin they wish to keep. :o)<br><br>The point is, it wouldn't seem=
 so negative to pitch in 10 BTC to become a seller, if you thought that you=
 would have some of that cost returned to you after each successful transac=
tion (regardless of your profit margin). This would a) set up a good seller=
 habits for new sellers, who are seeking satisfactory feedback on transacti=
ons to earn back their investment, and b) encourage longer term sellers if=
 they realized that they would need to sell at least X amount of items to=
 recoup their original investment cost. This would discourage people from=
 signing up for seller accounts if they only wish to sell one or two items.=
 This would also increase the average feedback of any given seller, since=
 they would seek to stick around selling at least for enough transactions=
 to recoup as much of their original investment as they could. And of cours=
e, that is better for buyers, because then a buyer would have more informat=
ion to use to choose reputable sellers.<br><br>Something to think about.=20

 The buyer will lose the opportunity to choose from a variety of sellers wi=

				My primary worry about this is that law enforcement have an unlimited=
 budget to spend buying up all of the new seller accounts. Law enforcement=
 HAVE spent TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars buying opiates from SINGLE (insecu=
re) vendors prior to busting them. Dropping a hundred grand on monopolozing=
 the new seller accounts is not out of the question for them. And I worry=
 that although this system will combat scammers, it also puts a dollar valu=
e on law enforcement being the only ones with new seller accounts. And that=
 is a price they are probably willing to pay if it results in SR turning in=
to a massive reverse sting honeypot with no real vendors selling on it anym=
ore. It could turn SR into a massive intelligence asset for the feds, and=
 intelligence assets of that high a strategic importance are easily worth=
 some big bucks to agencies with unlimited money (that they take from you=
 via taxes, woot! Don't you just love being forced to pay for your own oppr=
ession?)<br><br>I don't think SR is selling out, and in theory this is a go=
od method to combat scammers, but in practice I think it is more or less eq=
ual to offering the site to the feds if the price is right.

				Money grab is fine and actually perfectly in line with Agorism consider=
ing nobody is forced to sell or buy here. However, I wish he would do his=
 money grab in a way that isn't likely to result in the feds buying every=
 new seller account. Selling out to the state is not compatible with Agoris=
m, and I don't think that is what SR intends to do, but I do think that wil=
l be the end result. I suggest instead that you charge a % of each sale, an=
d allow vendors to load an account that let's them cover the cost or the bu=
yer cover the cost, or some combination. If you want to combat scammers, yo=
u should split sellers into ranks based on when they joined and their post=
 counts and then make the ranks scarce by not letting new people trivially=
 obtain them, then prune the ranks of scammers. This will result in scammer=
 to legit ratio decreasing over time in favor of legit, but does not open=
 up the very serious potential of law enforcement to legit ratio increased=
 toward law enforcement over time.=C2=A0 Silk roads best strategy is certai=
nly to let anyone sell. It still favors law enforcement and scammers who ca=
n make a shit ton of malicious accounts for everyone who is legitimate, but=
 at least it doesn't lock out legitimate people and open the door for law=
 enforcement if they are willing to pay the price. Also, by splitting the=
 members into ranks based on their join date and current reviews, you could=
 probably limit law enforcement and scammers even more so, particularly if=
 law enforcement did not start mass registration of accounts prior to the=
 Gawker rush. Accounts should indeed be scarce commodities, however it is=
 imo foolish to make the qualifier financial superiority, because this will=
 certainly tilt things towards law enforcement rather than combating them.=

 The third threat is pretty serious, but making accounts costly wont preven=

 likely to be enough to detect low dose poisons. To really combat this drug=

n't very safe to have a go to guy who gets products from every single vendo=

d a few other places that do advanced analytical testing for free + take an=
onymous samples. Obviously the person selling product can not post the resu=
lts themselves or they will just post fakes, but you could have a sub-forum=
 for buyers who get product to post the test results if they choose to send=
 in samples for testing themselves. Unfortunately, even the testing centers=
 in Netherlands require you to actually ship the sample to be tested from=
 Netherlands, and then there is the issue of 'we can't have a dude in the=
 netherlands who gets drugs from a fuck load of people to send in for testi=

 do what they can to fuck with it. Couple that with the power you have over=
 the exchange rate (you saw the gawker spike - shit, silk road is probably=
 the only real backing bitcoin has atm) and it's really not surprising that=
 they're trying to discourage users.<br><br>I don't think charging for acco=

 was actually determined to kill would not be dissuaded from that just beca=
use they get charged to do it. Law enforcement would also have no problem=
 paying for an account. It will however deter genuine business from small=
 sellers. The time it would take to start making a profit by selling my pre=
scriptions just wouldn't be worth it imo. And I especially wouldn't want to=
 pay knowing that such a terrible idea can't last.<br><br>Whistler's idea=
 is a stroke of genius though. I'd have no problem paying a retainer to be=
 used as collateral until I have a reputation that can speak for itself. As=
 for monetizing the service you provide, just take a slice of each sale and=
 call it a transaction fee.

fund from successful transactions which will prove it isn't a scam. It's fa=

 by doing this, only the most professional and committed sellers will have=
 access to seller accounts.=C2=A0 For the time being, we will be releasing=
 one new seller account every 48 hours, though this is subject to change.=
=C2=A0 If you want to become a seller on Silk Road, click "become a seller"=

				Most of us here--buyers and sellers--are grateful for what SR does, and=
 realize his position is not easy either.=C2=A0 But the reality is, somethi=
ng needed to be done to prevent fake seller scammers from easily joining an=
d wreaking havoc among the buyers.=C2=A0 He did that.=C2=A0 All I'm saying-=
-as a buyer--is that there might be other ways of spreading the burden arou=
nd.=C2=A0 And perhaps a way of lessening the burden on sellers who have pro=
ved they are legit, by making it more difficult for fake *buyers* to join=
 easily also.=C2=A0 I hadn't realized this was a problem until lately, and=
 it seems it's in areas other than the ones I follow.=C2=A0 But good seller=
s protect us buyers in many ways: in the packaging, in the labeling, in pm-=
ing us when packages are late, in posting gpg public keys so we don't freak=
 about our addresses: all kinds of ways.<br><br>I get defensive when buyers=
 are attacked, or when sellers want private forums...but the best way to av=
oid those outcomes is by accepting that some of the seller complaints are=
 legit, and supporting them in finding ways to make this a good safe place=
 for all of us....we're in this together.=C2=A0 It's a new venture, interna=
tional, disliked by *all* governments, and hopefully a harbinger of a futur=
e where we won't need to operate in the shadows, where what we put in *our*=
 bodies is *our* business.=C2=A0 <br><br>So it seems one of the biggest pro=
blems facing sellers is caused by abuse of escrow system, and I don't see=
 why there couldn't be a way where after one transaction, where both partie=
s are in agreement it went well, where buyers couldn't have a way to bypass=
 proxy and let seller get paid.=C2=A0 The sellers I deal with won't rip me,=
 so if pkg goes missing, I don't feel they burnt me.=C2=A0 This would let=
 legit sellers and buyers just do business, and only new sellers and buyers=
 would be 'under the escrow gun.'=C2=A0 <br><br>And I *want* SR to make mon=
ey.=C2=A0 Damned straight.=C2=A0 We can have dreams and hopes and political=
 views all day long, but this is a business venture, and needs to be profit=
able.=C2=A0 SR takes risks--provides service.<br><br>On the other hand, tho=
, the auctioning/selling of seller accounts is a good idea, and needs to st=
ay.=C2=A0 Nitpicking at SR's posts to prove inconsistency of ideology isn't=
 fair...we all jabber about all kinds of things on here.=C2=A0 That was som=
ething needed to be done, and he did it.=C2=A0 Well done.=C2=A0 What we wan=
t to do now is continue improvements, and find ways to get rid of bad buyer=
s, or at least make it more costly for them to join: that will get rid of=
 the fly by nite scammers, and whatever fee, even retrocative so as not to=
 be hypocrite, is fine with me.=C2=A0 This site, so far, has survived quite=
 a bit, and we need to help it along, when we can.

				@isiredsami - I feel like you're confusing what he didn't say with sayi=
ng something false. True, SR didn't say he wanted to make more money. i thi=
nk we all know he'd like to make more money. Most people like making money.=
 Why does he need to spell that out? But what is also true is that this pol=
icy was in response to an actual, not fictional, problem. The market was be=
coming flooded with bogus seller accounts, seeing if they could walk away=
 with a few BTC before a pattern emerged of their scamming. Now that someon=
e has to invest, they're more likely to actually be here for the long haul.=
 That makes sense to me. Where's the fiction?<br><br>I also wouldn't mind=
 charging a small fee for buyer accounts, since buyers are capable of scamm=
ing too. Making people invest a small amount of money into a semi-private=
 anonymous marketplace is a stabilizing force.

				Letting the market decide is fine, but why not have a screening process=
 too? This isn't, strictly speaking, the free market; this is a privately=

				@marketmaker - In a scenario where a seller has to get x dollars in sal=

 I think the way it is is great - still a lot of room for competition but=

 seller-base grows, and prices should come down a bit on the buyer side.=C2=
=A0 But this way we already have a ream of established sellers carrying bas=

				I see this new seller account fee as being problematic not just for mys=
elf, but for the community in general.=C2=A0 What I have seen in this threa=
d have been cost analysis done on a most base level, to simply state that=
 because you are nearing 100 transactions and the new seller account fee (w=
hich wasn't in place at your time) is 141 dollars, it essentially is $1.41=
 for each transaction!=C2=A0 This is the cajolery I expect on late night in=
fomercials not on open market forums.=C2=A0 The second dubious element is=
 the arbitrary valuation of the seller's account, sure there is an auction=
 where we can bid a 'fair' price but this auction block is directly underne=
ath and is firmly entwined with the 11 btc price-tag in pretty bold print.=
=C2=A0 I understand that scammers are bothersome and measures need be taken=
 to eradicate them, but it seems in this process honest the small-quantity=
 high-quality seller or seasonal sellers are left to face the monochrome re=
adouts after inputting 'insignificant' digits.<br><br>I understand this is=
 primarily to keep out unsavory resellers, but couldn't it also act to serv=
e certain avaricious resellers monopolistic hopes?=C2=A0 If they're able to=
 buy up new accounts as they come to market, keep competition to a minimum,=
 couldn't they make back what those accounts cost and more by controlling=
 every items price?=C2=A0 I know this is taking things to an extreme, but=
 who's to say otherwise?=C2=A0 Well I guess you need to pay to ride this tr=
ain, and with all the swaying and clattering going on, I am weary of paying=
 to ride the luxurious Orient Express in hopes of peddling my quality nonet=
heless scant wares...<br><br>I would think a fee re-evaluation or a "sample=
 transaction" means of verification would be as efficacious and cultivate=
 a richer more diverse marketplace.<br><br>Thanks,<br>peaches

				Really people, if you don't like the cost involved, then do what you ha=

 the option of either a one time fee or bidding on an auction.=C2=A0 It all=
