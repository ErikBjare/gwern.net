				He used to buy from his vendor account without encrypting his address.=
 He may have had the local police wanting an excuse to raid him for a while=
, unfortunately they may have been handed that information in the US invest=

				my house phone is not at mt current location its redirected to a unregi=
stered mobile phone! and i would guess they hit him hoping to find addresse=

 the room to talk on the phone to the fbi team running the raids, they also=
 kept asking him about the man they have and think is DPR.........

				It depends on a few things, if they had a warrant which it sounds like=
 they did then they have enough to do forensics on and recover a lot. There=
 is going to be a lot of data destruction. The last thing I do before I ret=
ire for the evening is clear my work computer.<br><br>I doubt he was runnin=
g TAILS or anything other than windows, I suspect this given that he didn't=
 encrypt his address when placing orders. That means trails that can be fol=
lowed. All that I can say is bad times. It depends who is working on his da=
ta, if it's the local police then no worries but if they call in the big bo=
ys then they can drudge up a fair amount if at any point it was in ROM.<br>=
