 busted. Where did they go wrong. How were they busted. What lessons have=

				So it kind of sounds like a lot of the busts that have happened were mo=
st likely incurred due to a lack of practicing good operational security,=
 being a little lazy, and maybe a bit too much co-mingling of activities be=

				Yeah, it doesn't seem like SR has ever been compromised itself, just ou=
tside of SR and people blabbing like idiots.<br><br>Best part of the SR is=
 that no one involved could compromise it and sell everyone out, as far as=
 I know, in order to save their own asses if they got busted. Doubtless LEO=
 already has accounts and knows how to sign onto the site, and that's clear=
ly not enough to bust them because they would have done so by now.

				So the bottom line is that we still have heard of no case where anyone,=
 vendor or customer has been busted as a result of LE tracking them down vi=
a SR (is this statement correct? I have sort of looked and haven't seen any=
 references otherwise).=C2=A0 All the busts involving SR I've heard about=
 have been tracked back into SR AFTER the person has been burned already.=

 SR, IMO.<br><br>Weeeeehaaaaaaaaaa! I just went to look for the stupid capt=

				I'm sure he means that SR is virtual as opposed to face to face dealing=
. No anonymity face to face except maybe using an alias. But for most vendo=
rs here, if we sold to a cop, all the cop gets is drugs and maybe a general=
 geographic location of where they came from and maybe our shipping method=
 at the time. But that's it. All the other information gleaned is useless=

				This is correct about dealing IRL. I am thinking about making a whole=
 new thread about how Silk Road almost literally saved my life. I've been=
 a shroom hunter for many years and because I don't go and hustle it, I was=
 forced to rely on middle men to stay safe and anonymous. Of course, the pr=
ice I got was so low that it kept me in near indentured servitude and slave=
ry for years and there was nothing I could do while they charged the highes=
t prices. The markup was over 500% from me the hunter to the consumer<br><b=
r>Silk Road changed all that. Now i do it myself and am able to charge chea=
per and more reasonable price and still make 3 times what I made before IRL=
 and now for the first time I can make enough to actually support my huntin=
g without fucking starving<br><br>I have no idea if cutting out middle men=
 is possible with the bigger manufactured chemicals, but for a small time=
 pro hunter of mushrooms like myself, Silk Road and DPR saved my life<br><b=
r>and I think that's what Silk Road is all about, helping to cut out the mi=
ddle men and other problems associated with selling IRL. It was never possi=
ble for me to do this IRL without middle men before Silk Road came along...=
.too risky<br><br>it was starvation wages before-not even minimum wage. Now=
 I can at least make a modest living. Thank you DPR and Silk Road!<br><br><=
