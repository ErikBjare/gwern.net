				Why to launder your cash - so they don't assume it's gained illegally=
 :) They can seize the drugs, but if you launder it right as I do with my=

				As it seems the BKA is really horny on shutting this thing down and I=
 feel really unsafe now on placing my first order. Its getting more and mor=
e unsafe here in Germany with the SR. In the next months we could see more=
 and more arrests because the police gets more experienced with SR busts an=

				On 2nd July the German police also busted some other internet drug oper=
ation which was selling XTC pills with payment via BTC. Its becoming quite=
 scary in Germany as they busted 3 big online vendors in 1 week. Anyone kno=
ws if this is also SR related (the report states that they were operating=
 on private forums)?<br><br>http://www.presseportal.de/polizeipresse/pm/115=

				I post the full text of this police press release here so you don't hav=
e to leave traces on their server and they cannot follow how many people ar=
e interested in this story.<br>As much as I got from a machine translation=
 it's about German XTC vendors operating here and police has a lot of data=
 as vendors seem to have bared their sould in custody.<br>It appears to be=
 the 3rd major bust in Germany and is dated July 10, 3:12 PM German time.<b=
r><br>A few reminders:<br>Compare PGP keys on a vendor's page with the one=
 you used before as this would be the easiest way for cops to get your data=
. To my knowledge Germany allows police to buy drugs to make a case but the=
y are not allowed to continue selling through a hijacked acct. Pls correct=
 me if this is a wrong assumption.<br><br>Fucking Nazis.<br><br>IDK the SR=
 post-bust policy but I think it would be good idea if DPR makes compromise=
d accounts inaccessible in order to limit the damage. Don't throw aroudn wi=
th vendor names here in the forum but PM the mods if you have any informati=
on that helps to protect this community.<br>=C2=A0<br>http://www.presseport=

gen: Hagener Polizei f=C3=BChrt Schlag gegen Internethandelhandel mit Ecsta=
sy-Tabletten.<br><br>Seit mehreren Wochen ermittelt die Hagener Polizei weg=
en Rauschgifthandels gegen eine =C3=BCberregionale T=C3=A4tergruppe aus div=
ersen St=C3=A4dten in NRW. Das Kommissariat zur Bek=C3=A4mpfung der Organis=
ierten Kriminalit=C3=A4t hat hierzu speziell eine Ermittlungskommission ein=
gerichtet. Grund daf=C3=BCr war der Verdacht eines gro=C3=9F angelegten Han=
dels mit Ecstasy-Tabletten und Amphetamin. Verk=C3=A4ufer und K=C3=A4ufer=
 traten dazu =C3=BCber abgeschottete Internetforen in Kontakt. Die Bezahlun=
g und Lieferung der Bet=C3=A4ubungsmittel fand anschlie=C3=9Fend auf dem Po=
stwege statt. Als Zahlungsmittel nutzen die Tatverd=C3=A4chtigen auch das=
 Internetzahlungsmittel Bitcoin. Die Beamten der Ermittlungskommission gehe=
n derzeit davon aus, dass auf diesem Wege ca. 65000 Ecstasy-Pillen mit eine=
m Marktwert von mehr als 250.000 Euro umgesetzt wurden. Die konspirative Ko=
mmunikation der Tatverd=C3=A4chtigen untereinander erfolgte mit h=C3=B6chst=
em technischem Knowhow, so dass auch die Ermittler der Hagener Kripo einen=
 enormen technischen Aufwand und umfangreiche konspirative =C3=9Cberwachung=
sma=C3=9Fnahmen betreiben mussten. Die intensiven Ermittlungen f=C3=BChrten=
 schlie=C3=9Flich zu einem positiven Ergebnis und zun=C3=A4chst zur Identif=
izierung von acht Haupttatverd=C3=A4chtigen in Essen, Herten, Unna, Velbert=
 sowie im Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis. Dar=C3=BCber hinaus gab es weitere Tatverd=C3=
=A4chtige im Alter von 19 bis 26 Jahren in Rheinlandpfalz, Hessen und Bayer=
n. Die in diesem Fall zust=C3=A4ndigen Staatsanwaltschaften aus Essen, Boch=
um, Wuppertal und Arnsberg beantragten entsprechende Durchsuchungsbeschl=C3=
=BCsse, die von den jeweils zust=C3=A4ndigen Gerichten erlassen wurden. Dam=
it waren die erforderlichen Voraussetzungen geschaffen und am Dienstag, dem=
 02.07.13 um 06.00 Uhr, schlugen die Ermittler zeitgleich an 11 verschieden=
en Orten in NRW zu und durchsuchten die Wohnungen der ermittelten Tatverd=
=C3=A4chtigen. Dabei stellten die Ermittler Bargeld in H=C3=B6he von 14.000=
 Euro, Handelsutensilien und zun=C3=A4chst kleinere Drogenmengen sicher. Da=
r=C3=BCber hinaus legten sie aber auch gro=C3=9Fen Wert auf die Sicherstell=
ung von Computern, Speichermedien und Datentr=C3=A4gern, um so die Tathandl=
ungen weiter aufhellen zu k=C3=B6nnen. Acht deutsche Tatverd=C3=A4chtige im=
 Alter von 21 bis 31 Jahren, wurden vorl=C3=A4ufig festgenommen. Noch am gl=
eichen Vormittag erfolgten weitere Durchsuchungen in den o. g. Bundesl=C3=
=A4ndern bei Abnehmern und Kontaktpersonen in Fulda, Worms, Weilheim und Wi=
ttlich. Dabei wurde neben kleineren Drogenmengen und einem Sturmgewehr auch=
 eine Cannabis-Plantage vorgefunden und gesichert. Die Festgenommenen zeigt=
en sich weitestgehend gest=C3=A4ndig, best=C3=A4tigten den Ermittlungsstand=
 und trugen mit ihren Aussagen zur weiteren Aufhellung bei. In weiten Teile=
n best=C3=A4tigten sich die bisherigen Ermittlungsergebnisse und die Erkenn=
tnisse =C3=BCber den Handel einer gro=C3=9Fen Zahl von Ecstasy-Pillen.<br><=
br>Noch an diesem Tag f=C3=BChrten Folgeermittlungen die Kripobeamten nach=
 Wickede a. d. R. zu einem weiteren bislang unbekannten Mitt=C3=A4ter. Eine=
 Wohnungsdurchsuchung f=C3=BChrte hier zur Sicherstellung von mehr als 11.0=
00 Ecstasytabletten im Wert von =C3=BCber 40.000 Euro und zahlreichen weite=
ren Beweismitteln, die den umfangreichen Handel belegten. Der 28-j=C3=A4hri=
ge Mann und seine gleichaltrige Lebensgef=C3=A4hrtin wurden vorl=C3=A4ufig=
 festgenommen. W=C3=A4hrend die Frau sp=C3=A4ter den Heimweg antreten konnt=
e, hat ein Haftrichter f=C3=BCr den 28-J=C3=A4hrigen Untersuchungshaft ange=
ordnet. Auch der j=C3=BCngste der erstgenannten acht Tatverd=C3=A4chtigen=
 war dem Haftrichter vorgef=C3=BChrt, auf dessen Anordnung aber gegen Aufla=
gen wieder entlassen worden.=20

 class=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div><br>I've=
 found some time to translate this article:<br><br>Since a couple of weeks=
 the police in Hagen is investigating a criminal group corperating from sev=
eral citys in NRW (biggest Bundesland <br>in GER). The comissionership for=
 fighting organized crime has set up a special unit for this case. They sus=
pected large trading of ecstasy<br>-tablets and amphetamine. Vendors and bu=
yers got in contact through secured/isolated internet forums. Payment and=
 delivery of the<br>narcotics happened through the mail system. The suspect=
s also used the internet currency Bitcoin for payment.<br>The officers of=
 the comissionership are currently assuming that approximately 65.000 ecsta=
sy tablets with a value of more than 250.000=E2=82=AC<br>have been sold thi=
s way. The consperative communication between the sucpects happened with hi=
ghest technical knowhow, forcing the<br>investigators of the Hagen criminal=
 investigation department to expend huge technical effort and use conspirat=
ive surveillance measures.<br>The intense investigations finally lead to a=
 positive outcome and identification of eight suspects in Essen, Herten, Un=
na, Velbert (these<br>are citys) and in the Ennepe-Ruhr area. More suspects=
, 19 to 26 years old were also identified in Rheinlandpfalz, Hessen and Bay=
ern <br>(these are Bundesl=C3=A4nder).<br>The prosecutions of Essen, Bochum=
, Wuppertal and Arnsberg requested search warrants, which were remitted fro=
m the responsible courts.<br>With this the necessary requirements were give=
n and on tuesday, 2. July 2013 at 6am the investigators striked simultaneou=
sly at 11 different places in NRW and searched the residences of the suspec=
ts. They confiscated 14.000=E2=82=AC in cash, trading paraphernalia and sma=
ll amounts of drugs. Great interest was set on the confiscation of computer=
s and data storage devices to find out more about the circumstances of the=
 crime. Eight German suspects from 21 to 31 years old were arrested. <br>Ev=
en more searches occured at forenoon in the already mentioned Bundesl=C3=A4=
nder targeting customers and contact persons in Fulda, Worms,<br>Weilheim=
 and Wittlich (citys). Not only small amounts of drugs, but also an assault=
 rifle and a cannabis plantation were found.<br>Most of the arrested suspec=
ts confessed the crimes, confirmed the state of the investigations and help=
ed the investigators to clear things<br>up. Most of the investigation resul=
ts and knowledge about the trade with great number of ecstasy pills could=
 be confirmed.<br><br>Following investigations made the same day from crime=
 officers leading to Wickede at the Ruhr (a city) resulted in finding a til=
l this<br>point unknown accomplice. A search of his residence resulted in=
 seizsure of more than 11.000 ectasy tablets with a value of more than<br>4=
0.000=E2=82=AC and a lot of other evidence, which confirmes big trading. Th=
e 28 year old man and his girlfriend which is the same age were<br>arrested=
. The woman was released later, while the 28 year old was remanded in custo=
dy by the committing magistrate. The youngest of the<br>eight suspects was=
 also arraignment to the committing magistrate but released on parole.

				The real risk comes when vendors have to do signed for deliveries. That=
 entails a visit to a post office or courier and a 'capture' on CCTV.<br><b=
r>If law enforcement agencies target a vendor, the focus will be on the del=
very methods vendors use. Buy a few listings (its legal for cops to buy dru=
gs if they are trying to infiltrate) and look were the mail is coming from.=
 Buy a 'signed for' delivery, then its a simple matter of contacting the po=
st offices own internal investigations and waiting for computer system to=
 flag up any given name or address. <br><br>All signed for post is on a dat=
abase. <br><br>Once cops identify one suspect, its usually easy to follow=
 a trail to the co conspirators.<br><br>Also, bear in mind cops simply hire=
 the best in the field for computer forensics. <br><br>The most risk free=
 ventures will simply be posting small amounts into mail boxes and posting=
 in locations which alter every so many days. Also, many vendors seem to us=
e the 'same' method of delivery. Same envelope, same logos. Once that is id=
entified, its easy to get more serious in the investigation. So altering th=
e look of the envelopes would help a lot. Also, change those return address=
es often.<br><br>I think also that anyone buying to resell needs to be care=
ful. Buying 50 grams or a kilo of speed, its obviously not personal use. <b=
r><br>Guess this is a warning that we need to be on our toes. Vendors selli=
ng big amounts are, IMO, the easiest to catch. I can order 28 grams of MDMA=
 for example, and get a tracking number which will lead to a time stamped=
 purchase which can lead to a look on the CCTV to ID the perp. <br><br>Be=
 safe.

				WASHINGTON, July 4 (UPI) --<br><br>=C2=A0The U.S. Postal Service photog=
raphs all mail processed nationwide in a program similar to U.S. electronic=
 surveillance, officials and security experts say.<br><br>"Basically they=
 are doing the same thing as the other programs, collecting the information=
 on the outside of your mail -- the metadata, if you will -- of names, addr=
esses, return addresses and postmark locations, which gives the government=
 a pretty good map of your contacts, even if they aren't reading the conten=
ts," computer security expert Bruce Schneier told The New York Times.<br><b=
r>The warrantless surveillance program for law enforcement is called Mail=
 Isolation Control and Tracking. It's been in effect almost 11 years.<br><b=
r>Last year alone Postal Service computers photographed the outside of abou=
t 160 billion letters and parcels, the Times said.<br><br>It is not known=
 how long the government keeps the images, the newspaper said.<br><br>The=
 images are kept as part of a law enforcement surveillance technique known=
 as "mail covers."<br><br>Mail covers do not involve reading the mail itsel=
f, just the outside information, and are not considered by the Postal Servi=
ce or Justice Department to be constitutional violations since the outside=
 of envelopes and packages can readily be seen by anyone.<br><br>"It's a tr=
easure trove of information," former FBI agent James Wedick told the Times.=
<br><br>"Looking at just the outside of letters and other mail, I can see=
 who you bank with, who you communicate with -- all kinds of useful informa=
tion that gives investigators leads that they can then follow up on with a=
 subpoena," said Wedick, who spent 34 years at the FBI and used mail covers=
 in a number of investigations.<br><br>But the program's sweeping nature di=
sturbs some people.<br><br>"In the past, mail covers were used when you had=
 a reason to suspect someone of a crime," Mark Rasch, who started a compute=
r crimes unit in the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal div=
ision, told the Times.<br><br>"Now it seems to be, 'Let's record everyone's=
 mail so in the future we might go back and see who you were communicating=
 with,'" he said. "Essentially you've added mail covers on millions of Amer=
icans."<br><br>The Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program was created=
 after the anthrax attacks in late 2001 that killed five people, including=
 two postal workers, and infected 17 others.<br><br>The program was secret,=
 but the FBI cited it last month during its investigation into ricin-laced=
 letters sent to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomber=
g.<br><br>The FBI said in a criminal complaint June 7 a postal investigator=
 tracing the ricin letters was able to narrow the search to New Boston, Tex=
as, actress Shannon Guess Richardson by examining front and back images of=
 60 pieces of mail scanned just before and after the tainted letters were=
 sent to Obama and Bloomberg.<br><br>The data showed return addresses near=
 her home, the FBI said.<br><br>Richardson originally accused her husband,=
 Nathan Richardson, of mailing the letters, but investigators determined he=
 was at work when the letters were mailed.<br><br>Shannon Richardson was in=
dicted and charged Friday in the mailing of the letters. She was also charg=
ed with sending a third ricin letter to Mark Glaze, the executive director=
 of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.<br><br><br><br>

				Buyers have nothing to worry about unless you are buying large quantiti=

 have some record of some dirtbag having sent you something.<br><br>Buyers=
 supplying unencrypted addresses makes me cringe. Most don't and although=
 I strongly suggest they do on all of my pages and make my key available on=
 every page of mine including the signature of all my forum posts most stil=
l don't do it. There's no excuse. Gpg4win is idiot proof and takes 1 minute=
. Just do it.<br><br>Vendors should encrypt their entire hard drive with Tr=
ueCrypt. It takes one night to do. You can encrypt all the individual files=
 you want but there will always be traces of your activities on the hard dr=
ive so just encrypt the whole thing. My whole drive is encrypted and if I=
 ever hear the slightest sound outside my door I immediately hit the power=
 button. Let them try to break a 30 character meaningless password :-)<br><=
br>Vendors need to change up their shipping times, locations, and LABELS.=
 I use a different return address every time. All it takes is one package=
 to get intercepted to compromise ALL packages if you are using the same re=
turn address on everything. Remember they take and save a picture of of lab=
els now.<br><br>Vendors should ideally be 1 person operations. If one perso=
n falls everyone does. Therefore have no others. You guys talk encryption=
 and bitcoin and Tor and this and that but you know what it takes for LE to=
 bust a huge SR vendor? To have one of the parties involved get pulled over=
 driving high, or one get caught hanging out at his friends grow house when=
 it gets raided, or have someone he loves take a huge fall. Then he flips=
 and whole operation gets busted regardless of all the encryption and anony=
mity. I know one guy who caught a huge case by getting side swiped by a dri=
ver who plowed through a redlight. The paramedics pulled him and several kg=
s from his car. It wasn't his fault, but he did 10 years. Keep operations=
 small so you have no one to worry about but yourself.=20
