				Yesterday I received 11 dilaudids from Nipplesuckcanuck. The order only=
 took two days to arrive and was packaged quite well.Two nice things - he=
 didn't ask me to FE even though I'm a new buyer, and he upgraded the deliv=
ery to a more expedited mail option at no charge. Very happy and going to=
 order more from him in the next few days.<br><br>Highly recommended partic=
ularly for Canadian purchasers.

				I received a sample order of 100mg 2C-C from nipplesuckcanuck. Shipping=
 took 6 days domestic, but was likely slowed down by the holiday. The packa=
ging was fine, certainly on par with what I've received from other sellers.=
 The product was 20-30% overweight, which I certainly appreciate. I haven't=
 had the chance to sample it yet but did perform a Marquis test. It confirm=
ed that a 2Cx chemical was present.<br><br>Throughout this process, nipples=
uckcanuck was very responsive to all my questions. I look forward to trying=
 the sample and plan to order again in the future. <br><br>All in all, a so=
lid transaction. Thanks!

				Received a rush order of MDMA before Canada Day weekend in about 3 days=
 after ordering. Also made arrangements for quicker shipping last minute,=
 which is a plus in he customer service department. Was greatly impressed=
 with the quality of the role compared to some other M I have tried before.=
 The experience was a little speedy for an extended period of time after ab=
out T + 3Hr / Had an epic shitty feeling half way through but was still hig=

 due to malnourishment / dehydration. Also provided the lovely empathy, and=
 music appreciation expected from this drug all the time while in peak and=
 plateau periods. Recommended product and seller for sure in Canada. Only=
 problem was a packaging issue that had nothing to do with stealth, so do=
 not worry. This I hope will be dealt with right away as it was kind of ann=

 communication and responded to all messages promptly and thoroughly.=C2=A0=

				Probably going to order some MDMA in the coming weeks. Plan is to send=
 a sample off to EcstasyData to see if it's pure or not. Not doubting your=
 product, Nipple... I just like to know what I'm taking, though. Once the=
 test is back, I'll share the findings.

				Yeah to be quite honest, I am kinda disappointed so far. I placed my or=
der last thursday night, hoping it would go out friday or saturday. I paid=
 for the Priority Worldwide option on shipping which is supposedly next day=
 to US by noon. It is wednesday now and I still havent received anything.=
 Supposedly it was put in transit yesterday. And when it was put into trans=
it, they also simultaneously canceled another order I had placed of 4-ACO-D=
MT with no explanation. I too have sent quite a few messages and they aren'=
t too wonderful on the communication end. For example, most of my messages=
 had more than one question in them that I was hoping would be answered. I=
 got about one reply a day and all the replies were one or two sentences lo=
ng and only addressed one of my issues. This made communicated take much lo=
nger than necessary as I would have to re-ask questions multiple times. A=
 few of them still haven't been answered, and the last message I received=
 was Monday night. It just really stinks, if you look at my posting history=
, I just came off a 17 day resolution with another LSD vendor named Gar who=
 turned out to be a scammer. I even explained this to them. At least they=
 didn't ask me to FE. But it's been almost three weeks of me trying to get=
 acid with just no luck whatsoever. God damn. <br><br>Anyway I am leaving=
 for a camping trip tomorrow, with a bunch of buddies who are going to be=
 very sad that we cant trip in the wilderness together. I wont be back unti=
l until Sunday, so good luck guys. I will keep you updated.

				Well I just got a message from him and=C2=A0 I must retract some of my=
 previous statements. I assumed I ordered with that priority worldwide ship=
ping option I spoke of, with the next day delivery, but he has never specif=
ically told me he was using that. I looked up the shipping prices of the di=
fferent mail services in canada and both fedex and the canada postal servic=
e have the same kind of option for the same price so i just assumed it was=
 that. I didnt check ups though. I paid 46$ for shipping though, if its not=
 next day, then i i dont know what the hell it is. Anyway i sent him a mess=
age a few minutes ago and he replied very quickly telling me he will supply=
 my tracking number tomorrow. Too bad I will be in the middle of the woods=
 and won't be able to check it. There is a very slim chance it may come tom=
orrow before I leave but I doubt it. Good luck guys, I look forward to read=
ing this thread sunday.

				Yeah, i ordered last sunday night and haven't received anything yet, ei=
ther. I see that some in the US have received tabs and finalized their orde=
rs already. I'm a tad disappointed as I am not too far from canada and have=
 not received anything yet. I'm not worried about losing tons of money, rea=

 it has mysteriously disappeared. He has also told me he would post picture=

				Hi, I have ordered his single tab LSD and it arrived after 4 days in tr=
ansit. I am in Canada as well. <br><br>I happen to have a friend who used=
 to live in the same area as the vendor, so he asked his long-time friend=
 from elementary if there is any mayans going around. He assured us that th=
ey were "pretty strong".<br><br>A little background before hand. I have nev=
er tried LSD prior to taking NSC's and really didn't know what I was gettin=
g myself into.<br><br>After eating some tasquitos, I went and dropped a sin=
gle tab. Almost 5-10 minutes after I was getting raced thoughts (I don't kn=
ow if this is common, is it?) and after 30-40 minutes the walls were gettin=
g that shifting feeling, you know when your on shrooms and stuff tends to=
 drift into others. <br><br>Time was never recorded, since I unplugged my=
 clock and never really cared about time.<br><br>After what appeared to be=
 an hour and a half, I was getting these symmetrical images, they were quit=
e different that I have ever seen before. Speaking from multiplies (20+) of=
 solo mushrooms trips. And while laying in bed I was able to relate English=
 to the way these fractal images appeared. The images for the English pheno=
menon were distinct from the rest of the visuals I happen to conjure. <br><=
br>The clouds were really cool to, they looked like they were constantly mo=
rphing and blending. Parts of it looked like the fading section of 3Jane's=
 blotter art that was faded. (I don't know if you happen to check it out or=
 anything)<br>

				I asked him to cancel both my orders as of this evening. I asked him if=

 if i even had anything sent out, despite having 2 orders with him marked=
 "in transit." why would you mark something as shipped and then wonder if=
 anything was sent at all? only if you think you're certain that you've fud=

 the future. if he can't handle sending multiple single dose orders out, he=
 shouldn't have the listing up, am i right? i don't doubt now that he has=
 legit product because he has US customers who've finalized and left positi=

				No problem, man. and yes, by all means, try your best to buy from vendo=
rs who will stay in escrow. if he would have required me to FE when i first=
 ordered from NSC, i would have cancelled my order then and there and would=
 have not had all this to post about lol.

t's awesome, man! i hope you get your stuff in soon. I know his profile say=

ce during his "hired help" ordeal, but i don't think i fall under that cate=
gory since i was given my btc back and sent approx 1/2 of my order AND told=
 never to order from him again ::) whooops lol he has decent acid at very=
 reasonable prices, so if his supposed helpers were actually fired and he=
 didn't require FE for USA orders i probably would have considered buying=
 from him again.<br><br>IF he did see that you were slamming his vendor rat=

 think that may very well have caused him to reach out to you to make thing=
s right so he could clear up some of the crap that's been done in his name=
 since he started, whether it was ACTUALLY hired help or not. Vendors in th=
e know know that plenty of people read the reviews here and they most certa=
inly do carry a lot of weight when people are looking into buying from them=
. The more honest we buyers are about what goes down, the more honest our=
 vendors will be (in theory, at least).<br><br>as for the +1 karma stuff,=
 don't worry about it, man. you don't get that option til you hit 100 posts=

				I believe in what NSC is doing, and support him all the way. The blotte=
r he has been providing, has been spreading love since 08' according to som=
e forums. For example, those flower of life blotters were going around back=
 in 2008-2009 in Canada, and some people speculate that they come from the=
 same source as the Alpha Centauri. Nonetheless, the first and only order=
 I received from Nipple was a couple of flower of life blotters. <br><br>Th=
e experience is memorable, that's coming 30+ solo mushroom trips, depicting=
 a relationship that is dwindling between me and my father. Furthermore the=
 visuals were almost tangible, they really spoke truth in choreographing my=
 thoughts, one in particle shares an image of Alex Grey's portrait, Net of=
 Being. The ability to comprehend that image in my mind was simultaneously=
 overwhelming and comforting. <br><br>The next week, I dropped the other on=
e and it was an interesting experience as well, having the ability of talki=
ng to others in a constructive cohesive manner. Thought I preferred the par=
t of being alone after it was all done, since you know, that I prefer takin=
g substances alone to deal with persistent issues that riddle my daily life=
. Anyways I don't wanna go into that, but I will say that for a moment I wa=
s able to have closed eye visuals of the eyes in Alex Grey's portrait, Dyin=
g. Though I didn't feel like I was dying, in comparison to mushrooms. It st=
arted with one eye, and continued to construct itself upwards, kinda hard=
 to describe a visual. Anyways I have blabbered on too long for any of you=
 to change your opinion on NSC, whether that be positive or a continuum of=
 what is occurring.

				Nipplesuck was really kind to me, and added in a few extra tabs for the=

 though:<br><br>for people who have tried his tabs, how many do you suggest=
 I should take for a decent medium-strong trip? I don't want complete ego=
 loss and not knowing where I am, but I do want some good visuals and deep=
 introspection. I have only done (apparently) very weak acid before where=
 3 tabs barely made me see visuals, and only when I concentrated on them.<b=

				if its 100 to 150 uq then i would take 1 if your not sure. but two will=
 give you a good 6-8 hr trip. but Acid hits every one differently. if your=
 not sure drop one and see then you can decide from there.<br><br>

 is it whichever comes first? Thanks for adding that shipping for me on the=

				first post here--yea should have done more thorough reading of the faqs=
 but nearly wet my pants when i discovered SR recently=C2=A0 been twenty ye=
ars since i did any l and that was the kind of crap where you could eat 5=
 or 10 and still drive. I cut my teeth in the early mid seventies when ther=
e was legit 4 way to be had for 2 bucks/hit and so am very eager to see whe=
ther we have made some forwards progress to the times when acid was cheap,=
 plentiful, and on occasion extremely potent..the early reviews/posts here=
 very worrisome, but hope to introduce a very special friend who at the rip=
e old age of 46 is inexperienced in this way. anyway my hat is off to all=
 the brave souls who have had a hand in making this site available--te most=

				yeah on said date, or whenever 100 tickets are sold, I believe its 100=
 I will double check and make a correction if I am wrong. Some shite happen=

 you I have done weak acid and I have done very potent acid, that makes peo=

				I need to vent briefly. Many many of my hours are eaten by people messa=
ging me saying, it's been in transit 8 days, I'm getting paranoid. two of=
 those days are always the weekend. Also regular post doesn't deliver mail=
 in 5 days guaranteed , sometimes your lucky if you get it in 2 weeks, or=
 even longer. If you want quick post get express. Chill the fuck out people=
. My packaging is fine and you have nothing to worry about. I am not the po=
stal service as well. I know everyone gets excited for their packs but be=
 patient please, it's a huge frusterating waste of my time. Thanks everyone=
 I love y'all but just use yer heads before you ask me a bunch a dumb quest=

 outside of SR. Trip your fuckin balls off people. Spread the love and the=

 would it be possible to take ten and be ok. But any casual or even fairly=
 regular user should be mind blown on two. Thanks again for all the support.

 been hitting. Stuff like that is to be expected and every vendor probably=
 goes through it. From anybody with a functioning attention span, it's very=
 easy to see you're consistently on top of any problems that have arisen fo=

y decided it was more profitable just to keep the money for himself. Lesson=
 learned, research on forums and never FE. My third order was placed with=
 a fairly reputable vendor who "just got some tabs in" and was trying his=
 hand at LSD for the first time. Ordered 2 as a sample, and they arrived pr=
omptly and all, but I was and still am fairly sure it was a NBOMe, not the=
 LSD I was sold. I had some idea, from research, what to expect with acid,=
 but the trip was far to speedy and was quite short. 25c and I are old frie=

 to reporting back to you all sometime this week with good news.=20

				allright people let me explain. There was some major delays and a coupl=

 of. Your order drugboy should be fine, it would normally leave from *edite=
d to remove location for vendors security - microRNA* I am going to take do=
wn y lsd listings till monday or tuesday to get caught up. Everyone who has=
 ordered from me, if you are not satisfied, just tell me. I will try to res=
olve the issue. Coming onto the forums and talkng like I'm just absent or=
 something makes people panic. I'm not online everyday and I don't work eve=
ry single day either. I don't guarantee shipping times because it takes me=
 time to process orders, from reading hundreds of messages to just taking=
 down the orders to packing to shipping, its a lot of work. I am trying to=
 be a stand up vendor and supply you folks with a quality product. I hope=
 you can understand. Usually processing can take=C2=A0 a day or 2 after I=
 have clicked processing. I like to allow people to f/e and also packaging=
 takes me a while. There's also waiting on escrow and constantly restocking=
. My supplier has a life and so do I. I want you to get your orders in a ti=
mely manner just as much as you do believe me. It brings me massive amounts=
 of joy to bring lsd into peoples lives. Just know I'm not out to rob or st=
eal or any of that garbage, it just can take me a while. And if it does I=
 try to give a little extra for the persons trouble in general. Hope this=
 answers your questions. Pm me in SR if it doesn't Love you bitchy mofos lo=

				Mate im sorry, with all these allegations being thrown around its easy=
 to think the worst. Just a simple piece of advice, do not place orders in=
 transit until u actually have the mail in ur hand and ur going to drop it=
 off. Allowing an order to process for 2-3 days before placing it in transi=
t is absolutely OK. Once you are getting large scale bussiness you got to=
 think accordingly and make it smoother man. Obviously, cases when they sta=
te they want to FE (they have to mention it in address while ordering, or=
 they are plain fucking stupid) can be placed in transit immediately. Alot=
 of us buyers are smart, and we know what to do and we just want a simple,=
 quick transaction, we read ur vendor page and get everything together befo=
re placing the order. I did all of this, and i really expected my order to=
 sort of be here already. Its all good though, minor glitches, we will iron=
 them out! Most of your problems i think will be solved by this. I have fai=
th in you mate, i really hope you get on top of things soon. Going into ste=
alth mode for a few days does not seem like a bad idea at all :) Take care=
 mate

				Thanks brother. There obviously have been a few occasions of misplaced=

				Thankful for the SR and first review of any type is NSC's latest blotte=
r offering.=C2=A0 About me: guessing 100+ trips spanning 40 years and with=
 the help of=C2=A0 dumb luck (living in the west coast USA during the 1970'=
s), good friends and keen enthusiasm, I have had the opportunity to sample=
 some very good LSD indeed on more than a few occasions. My good friend=C2=
=A0 (who was a complete novice to psychedelia) and I each did two squares=
 of a backed and=C2=A0 unperfed blotter. It was a perfect dose for the occa=
sion--exceptionally clean product--with no nausea, GI disturbances, muscle=
 misbehavins or any other bodily intrusion whatsoever. Had a divine time--v=
ery mild visuals but serendipity placed some remarkable cirrus clouds and=
 beautiful sunset in our path which was the playground of the imagination=
 for a bit. It was more about what was inside your head versus a sensory ka=
leidoscope. Shared some great Belgian beer and some of my favorite=C2=A0 mu=
sic via killer headphones which of course was enhanced by the bucketload,=
 but in the end it will be the conversation I will cherish--laughed and cri=
ed, joked and riddled. Revealed and savored.<br><br>This is some really fin=
e product, next time we will take 4 a piece and I can see doing 8 without=
 fear if looking for a level 4-5 experience. The Nipple Suck man came thru.=
 4.7/5 stars and that only because I was spoiled in the 70's by 300+ mic hi=
ts that cost me lunch money. Guess those days are gone, but per mic this is=
 very reasonable compared to many of the euro and aussie vendors. Would buy=
 again more in a heartbeat. Trip specifics--45 minutes to undeniable differ=
ent sensation, slow progression to gentle and sustained peak from t+ 2-4 hr=
s, and incredibly gentle descent allowing sleep at +10 hrs with almost no=
 ill effects=C2=A0 whatsoever next day. Estimated dose 80mics/square.

				@Old lady driver: My guinea pig is not worthy of the sacred molecule.=
 He thinks it caused some very violent vomiting and a migraine headache tha=

				Hey everyone, my internet is fucking shit lately so its been hard for=
 me to connect to tor, I just had new internet installed and it is supposed=
 to be very fast but is shit.I don't want people to get choked at me on her=
e, there is bumps in the road though my friends especially in this business=
, I don't want to give away details of my op but its seperated into a few=
 places, and sometimes getting money out of here let alone to other places=
 in the country. I'm not sure if you are all familiar with how difficult re=
moving thousands of dollars a week is and then getting it to the people I=
 need to. That being said, if you're order is in the resolution center I ha=
ve decieded to do a reship with tracking. It is hard to deal with all yer=
 orders, with all the intense impatience on top of them .Mcore, you have th=
e right to be pissed,although you are extremely far away from me, one of yo=
ur orders should have arrived by now I feel. I don't know delivery times to=
 there though as it's the first time I mailed there. I have said this over=
 and over again, if your pack doesnt get there talk to me, I will never fuc=
k any person around, unless you stink like a scammer. I am super dooper und=
erstanding and I hope all you SR goers can learn that you are purchasing il=
legal drugs through the darknet,this isn't ebay. I can't just take your bit=
coin and walk to my dealers house and hand it to him. Shit can take a while=
, have patience. Thank you to all the people previous to this who have some=
 understanding. I am in this to spread lsd around not to gouge people, that=
s why I charge what I do. But now that I have ranted, all of my delays are=
 now taken care of. everything should be full on operational on monday. Con=
tact me throuh SR with questions.LOVE!

 those who got tracking numbers from nsc, how long did the post take, and=
 where to?<br><br>nsc - perhaps it would be better for all involved if you=
 used regular international airmail (with a dcn, or at least the option).=
 That way shipping will cost much less ($16.30 with tracking, if I understa=

 well give the packages less attention, and both parties can still have the=
 benefit of tracked delivery. Thoughts?<br><br>Anyway I'm looking forward=

				Well, I didn't know anyone complained about the potency of my lsd, the=

				I think as long as NSC mentions publicly that he is a bit behind or tha=
t his shipping may not be the fastest, it's all fair. I understand it can=
 be tough for one man to process all those orders. Life can be busy outside=
 of SR and not everybody can devote many hours a day to it. I am waiting pa=
tiently for my hunab kus to arrive, and don't mind how long it takes as lon=

				Well snap back to reality :) Thought I would give a quick trip report=
 from last night.=C2=A0 My background with LSD is what most would call exte=
nsive (excluding the hardcore locals around here :) )=C2=A0 I've taken more=
 trips than I remember, never used anything other than mescalin, shrooms,=
 salvia or acid.=C2=A0 I only mention this to hopefully shed some light on=
 my ability to recognize good acid.=C2=A0 That being said I went dry in 200=
3ish along with alot of people.=C2=A0 I have a 9 year baseline tolerance lo=
l!=C2=A0 I don't smoke pot, haven't drank alcohol, I was rested, fed, and=
 exercised. The only drug I have consumed was my first and only hit of ecst=
acy ever, 7 weeks ago.=C2=A0 As far as storage, these tabs came out of the=
 mailbox 15 minutes after delivery, and went from the envelope directly int=
o a lockbox stored in my fridge.=C2=A0 It was not removed from its packagin=
g or the box until last night.<br><br>Dropped at 2030h last night.=C2=A0 Ab=
solutely no taste, swallowed blotter around 15 minutes later as it had most=
ly dissolved in my mouth.<br>Felt some of the body effects that are familia=
r to me from LSD after 20 minutes, I knew I was coming up on something.=C2=
=A0 Slight tingling or strange feeling deep in my pallet and in my teeth.=
 No jaw clenching or anxiety...just that special feeling I had always felt=
 before I took off.<br><br>+1 hr Definatly LSD, Slight shift in perception,=
 Shadows far more noticeable.<br>+2 hr 5hr Peak, leaving me very clear head=
ed, able to focus, linear thought patterns.=C2=A0 CEV next to non existent.=
=C2=A0 Lots of fluttering in my peripheral vision, shadows look 3d, slight=
 breathing or wiggle from the objects in front of me.=C2=A0 If I focus on=
 an object for a few seconds I can "allow it to give a bit of OEV but it is=
 very very weak.=C2=A0 Full awareness of time passage and self. <br>+6 -+8=
 hrs peak is definatly over, didn't get anymore intense, eat for the 3rd ti=
me through the experience, chilling out watching a few episodes of Firefly,=
 perhaps SLIGHTLY more interested in the show than usual.<br>+8 hrs go into=
 a very light but restful sleep for 5 hours.<br>+14hrs awake, mostly rested=
, no hangover or headache's....just really hungry.<br><br>Conclusion: Comin=
g in with a clean blood stream and a very very long period of abstinence,=
 I would say that these tabs are without a doubt LSD, and very good quality=
 LSD at that.=C2=A0 I would also say they are in the RANGE advertised.=C2=
=A0 Based only on my previous experience and education, I would put the tab=
 I had in the 80-90 mic range.....Definatly not like the one hit wonders I=
 used to get in my youth, but still quality L.=C2=A0 I would recommend even=
 a complete noob to acid take 2 hits of this acid.=C2=A0 1 tab takes you ri=
ght to the point of seeing the magic behind the veil, but you wont cross th=
e veil.=C2=A0 If that makes sense.=C2=A0 I will do this acid again in decem=
ber but I will take 2 - 3 hits.=C2=A0 <br><br>Very Good ACID :)=C2=A0 just=
 dose appropriatly.=C2=A0 =C2=A0NSC Thanks for providing this to the commun=
ity.=C2=A0 I hope you get your shipping sorted. I will be ordering a large=
 order of this stuff but not until I have seen from the forums that your sh=
ipping is in order again.

				After extensive testing, I have come to the conclusion that this is def=
initely LSD. It is very potent LSD. It has resulted in excellent and some=
 very therapeutic trips for people. I was a little dubious last time I pers=
onally used these but after reagent testing and tripping again while collec=
ting feedback form others, I have more data to work with. Blotter guess is=
 around 100-110 mics. I'll be getting bitcoins together to buy a lot more=
 very soon. Thanks nsc.

tion would be nice, as I kinda feel like my order is stuck in limbo at the=
 moment, with no sense of direction as to where it is or how much longer it=
's going to take. Thanks and much love nsc.

				I placed 2 very small international orders recently which got "lost" (N=
OT from NSC). I live in the US, and hurricane Sandy has hit NY around that=
 time (mid october). I am staying away from international orders until thos=
e issues are cleared up. I bet customs lost some letters.

				I was told by him over the weekend to ask for the tracking number for=
 the reship on Monday, did so and was then told he was out of the "office"=
 and that he'd send it out tomorrow ( Tuesday). It's Wednesday now and stil=
l no tracking number. Sent him a message earlier tonight asking for the tra=
cking number so hopefully we'll see what's up. I'm not implying that NSC is=
 turning scammer, but I think all of us who have purchased from him and are=
 planning on purchasing from him need to stay extra vigilant for next week=
 or two. He's given us good communication of what has been up on his end,=
 but it's been excuse after another on why there is an abundance of orders,=
 some Canadian domestic even, that have not been fulfilled. There's been a=
 lot of people finalizing early on his vendor page, some to avoid auto-fina=
lizing and others to obtain his bonus offer despite the lack of current ord=
ers being received albeit for that one fellow from central Europe I believe=
 who got their product in 14 days. NSC, I apologize in advance if this in=
 any way damages your credibility or hurts your internet feelings and will=
 be more than happy to eat crow (and LSD), but up until people start receiv=
ing their orders my skepticism towards you is on high alert. Current and po=
tential buyers, please stay in escrow and resolution center until a fair nu=
mber of us begin receiving product. Those of us still waiting on current pr=
oduct, please keep us all updated as days go by. Peace all.

				I have come on to explain several times, please wait one more week if=
 not just ask me for your money back, I remailed shit loads of packages, an=
d caught up on all of my old backed ones. I am trying to go through about=
 50-75 messages a day and I can barely even connect to the site. I WILL NEV=
ER STEAL ANYONES MONEY. If you want your money out of escrow I will issue=
 you a refund, if you f/e'd and no longer think the drugs are coming I will=
 refund you. If you ask for a refund give me a day or so, I don't always ha=
ve bitcoin. Seriously, I understand that I have made a couple mistakes, but=
 the amount of speculation that goes on, on here is crazy. If you do not tr=
ust your drugs are coming, contact me for a refund, or wait for your shipme=
nt. I had delays on my end, then sandy caused huge postal delays as well.=
 Some of the reships I sent were sent by regular mail, as they were very sm=
all orders and paying 20 dollars to reship a package that only makes me 15=
 dollars in profit is a pretty big loss. I am absolutely against stealing,=
 and if I were on here to be making money like that I would charge more for=
 my products.Much love. I will be back on here in a few days, you will see=
 people updating their statuses soon. And yes several people have been give=
n their reship tracking numbers. I can ask them to come on here and review=
 if you guys need reassurance.

				I got mine today. Took 28 days from order date, but he msg'd me and let=
 me know right from the start there would be a delay. His profile clearly=
 states when there are delays too, so he is upfront and honest about it. Th=
is was my second order from him, and the quality is very good, and it IS ls=

her acid on SR. The shipping isn't the quickest but he comes through. Keep=
 it up nipple. And thanks for another completed order. Still a fan.

				I just received my order today. It took about three and half weeks to=
 get to me, I'm located in South Central United States. Packaging was defin=
itely sufficient and looked like a regular piece of mail. From the outside=
 you couldn't tell what the contents were. Patience is very good to have,=
 as he has turned out to be a trustworthy vendor. This being my first inter=
national order and it being the most unlawful thing I've order so far, it=
 was a relief to see that everything worked out so smoothly. Definitely rec=
ommend this vendor. Will be dosing later and am excited about the quality=
 stated in other posts.

er again. Buffer or suffer. You need to figure out your weekly demand rate=
 of the different listings you have. Buffer your inventory by getting them=
 ready for shipping before they are ordered, so you can have prepackaged or=
ders that just need postage and addresses. You need to do this once a week.=
 I would say Sunday would be the preferred day. Don't log into Silk Road ma=
rket or forum. Spend that day buffering your inventory in preparation for=
 sales that week. Pick a time of day that you will process orders for that=
 day. Like lets say 7pm. Print all your shipping labels for the one of your=
 quantities, like 10 strips. Label the packages and apply postage. Then mov=
e on to the next quantity, until the process is complete. Make a monthly pu=
rchase of postage and get extra so you don't run out. This will smooth over=
 processing time and make your shipping days Tuesday through Saturday with=
 no shipment going out on Sunday and Monday. <br><br>One big point to make=
 is Don't mix up your inventory. You don't want to ship a 10 strip to someo=
ne that purchased 25 and vice versa. You may decide to get different color=
 envelopes to keep them separated<br><br>PM me if you want to go into great=
er details or need specific advice..=20

				yep, thats what I have now begun, the problem was getting more and more=
 orders constantly, and then trying to catch up. I was overwhelmed, its all=
 good now. Getting a massive supply was also important, working with escrow=
 took some getting used to, its kind of hard to get enough of it into cad=
 so I can buy more in the real world without it being tracked back to me di=
rectly. Either way thanks for the advo, definitely always appreciate it. I=
 just have a hard time with people starting up the "hope he hasn't gone sca=
mmer stuff" and all that. It's hard to keep in mind that the things people=
 read on these forums, especially new to sr, shapes their views of vendors.=
 I have lots of experience buying and quite a bit for selling and I would=
 have to say that I am honest and fair and I charge a very good price for=
 my product,also I have always resolved issues and even been more than fair=
 in many circumstances when issuing refunds and reships. I love LSD and all=
 things that change the way people look at the world,opening hearts and min=
ds is my goal, while making a living and helping my community. I am a good=
 person and will never take anything that isn't earned or given freely, it'=
s my theology. I do this for you guys, and I will be trying to do it much=
 faster now heh. So fngers crossed for the weeks to come people. Much love.

uired, and haven't nagged NSC since it's again obvious that he's been busti=
ng his ass to keep up. He's a one-man operation dealing with a fairly high=
 volume in the middle of some substantial difficulties with the storm, SR=
 being slow, etc. I'm going to continue to wait patiently despite my eagern=
ess to try the tabs, and I'm confident that they will arrive. If I don't ge=
t them by the end of next week, then I'll politely nag him just to make sur=
e I didn't slip through the cracks :)<br><br>The Canuck-only special sounds=
 excellent, can't wait!<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div cla=
ss=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div>I'm in the same boat! cant wait to get th=
e goods. Hopefully here before wednesday. But if not not a biggie. I've wai=
ted 4 weeks for a package from the neterlands, and the wait just made the=
 package getting there so much sweeter. although the wait did suck. Anyways=

 days and no arrival. It took ~7 days last time. I understand that there ar=

 was really hoping that he at least shipped it so there's hope of it arrivi=

				It's been 21 days since I ordered my 110 hits, and I was getting that=
 horrible ripped-off feeling reading the posts on here. But I just got a me=

 this guy is sincere and legitimate, and he'll make everything right with=

				Just received my order from NSC yesterday. I ordered it around 3 weeks=
 ago and it was only going domestic. I was a little miffed at first, but ev=
entually, it all came through. I got the extra 10% bonus as well as free EX=
PRESS shipping in the end. They sent it the 27th and gave me a tracking num=
ber, I got it the 28th. It was truly express shipping, whereas I've gotten=
 express from other domestic vendors that has taken like 4 days for "expres=
s". Although something got mixed up/lost for me (and what it seems like, ma=
ny others also), in the end I got my product even though I DID FE. NSC coul=
d have easily said he sent it and it got lost and not given me the time of=
 day, but he replied to all my annoying concerns and messages and it all wo=
rked out in the end. <br><br>Although his products aren't my cup of tea and=
 they were for a friend, I would do business with him(?) again immediately.=
 Good communication, honest replies and solved my problem in the end. Can't=
 ask for much more when it doesn't go perfectly smooth.=20

				I got my order today, 25 days after placing it. I ordered 100 hits and=
 FE'd for the extra 10 hits, and wound up with 115! NSC's stealth has defin=
itely improved, but it could really be better. My envelope had customs tape=
 on it so it was opened, but the acid was apparently not noticed. He offere=
d to refund m shipping fee, which I accepted, but it has yet to happen at=
 this point. This guy is an awesome vendor, even if it takes forever for hi=
s items to get delivered. He could have taken my money and run with it if=
 he wanted to. I think sooner or later his shipping times will improve, but=
 either way he's an honest dude who comes through.<br><br>I'm waiting on a=

				Update from his profile page :)<br><br>"NSC IS BACK!!! Ok My peoples,=
 it appears that most of the reships are all good now, still some delays fo=

d all of you should have your packs by next week. I love you all and thank=
 every one of you for your patience. Some of you may not know that I had pl=
anned a trip away to relax a bit, but got into and accident on my way out,=
 so I have been recovering, blegh. Anyways I will try to get to all of your=
 messages tonight. I am changing a few things so this delay issue ends. I=
 will be shipping on mondays and on fridays from now on. I will be posting=
 accurate to stock amounts so when my listings go down, expect a couple day=
s for them to get back up. If you got caught in either the hurricaine or my=
 fuck up delays then let me know if you would like to try ordering again,=
 I am always grateful for return business and a second chance I will probab=
ly toss you a freebie or two. I have spoken with a retrained my team, if yo=
u have inqueries about your shipping times, it can take a couple days for=
 response as we have a fairly complicated system going now. I am putting my=
 listings back up, but I won't be sending out my first orders until monday,=
 tuesday latest as I get everything running proper again. Much love to my=
 peoples. I will get to you all as soon as I can and then we can move to cl=
ear quick shipping waters.<br>Also for my first few 1000 lots sold I am red=
ucing my costs, no more intnl express please."<br><br>Placed another order=
 and hopefully this time it will take less than 40 days to arrive ;)<br>

				Lesson learned... FE is not worth a few extra tabs. Period. It's been=
 about 40 days or so since I ordered. Just placed another order with a diff=
erent top vendor to be sure I have party favors for the holidays. Would hav=
e gladly placed the bigger order with NSC had my 25 pack sample actually co=
me. From what I see here, I do think NSC will come through eventually. But=
 the lack of updates here in the forum and the fact that my message has gon=
e unread for 3 days is a little worrisome. Please, Please deliver NSC. I've=
 been burned before and it doesn't feel good. I FE'd in good faith for what=
 looked to be a respectable vendor and paid ~$30 for Express Shipping. 40=
 days in and I have little doubt that my package still hasn't even been shi=
pped. <br><br>My name on the road is BassnectarLSD. Please check my message=
 when you get a chance. I understand you probably have lots and lots of mes=
sages to deal with. I'm prepared to be patient. Especially since I now have=

 or three times that my order had been shipped when it obviously wasn't, it=
 finally WAS shipped and it showed up safe and sound at my doorstep. After=
 I received the goods he voluntarily refunded my shipping fee. I'm a relati=
vely new member of SR with absolutely no clout in this community, placing=
 a huge order and FEing like a dumbass. He could have completely ripped me=
 off no problem, and with little consequences, but he didn't. I received my=
 LSD a week or two ago, and it took over a month to arrive if I remember ri=
ght. NSC totally doesn't have his shit together, this is true. But there's=
 no reason to get emotional and call him a scammer, because he isn't.

				Look for the folks who haven't received there stuff for awhile now, giv=
e NSC time. A month and a half ago I was brewing up a similar shitstorm for=
 NSC because things began to reek of scam or selective scamming at least an=
d lo and behold he took care of things pretty well. NSC has dropped the bal=
l a number of times, but he always been fairly quick at making things right=
, which given the nature of SR speaks fucking volumes. It's pretty easy to=
 get upset with people over money and drugs especially when it's so anonymo=
us, but just stay patient with NSC. Don't bombard him with the same redunda=
nt messages and instead ask him if there's anything you can do to make thin=
gs smoother. I like to think of him like the Forrest Gump of vendors. A bit=
 slow and clumsy sometimes, but good natured and dedicated. NSC, just stay=
 focused and maybe take another break soon to fix things completely before=
 taking on more orders?=20

 several US domestic who's acid is equal or better then NSC...and there are=

				Well, my re-ship arrived. 47 days after ordering and going through a lo=
t of doubt, I now have my hunabs.<br><br>Some questions many have already=
 established:<br><br>Is NSC a scammer? No.<br>Is NSC a good guy? Yes.<br>Is=
 NSC slow as molasses? Absolutely. Maybe this issue will be getting fixed=
 as he says, so I suggest everyone hang tight and let him get fully caught=
 up.<br><br>My re-ship was sent registered requiring signature, which I was=

 LSD is as easy to hide as a needle in a haystack. So why just place the ne=
edle neatly on top of the haystack? With virtually the same amount of effor=
t it could have been 1000x more hidden.<br><br>Anyhow, nice guy, glad he ca=
me through in the end, but really hope he gets things together, for his own=
 sake and for the sake of all his SR clients. I would not feel good about=
 ordering again until I could be assured that he has raised the bar on secu=

				Ordere42 days ago. NSC took my money and said he mail my product. Trans=
action went to resolution and NSC says he reship it. He did not however ask=
 for shipping info. He violated S.R. Vendor Rules and did not destroy my in=
fo as soon as transaction was complete. I confronted him on this and he cha=
nged his story and now says he actually did not ship it the first time, so=
 the reship was actually the ship. Never the less, my information laid arou=

 gotten raided, LE would have an address where i get shit mailed to. This=

				This is sad to see... So many people have come in saying they've receiv=
ed their orders since I ordered over 60 days ago and then raving about the=
 product's quality. Granted I haven't stayed on his ass bugging him to get=
 my shit. I figured he had enough people blowing up his inbox. Plus I don't=
 have time to log in here and constantly make my concerns known. Until now=
 I haven't had to on silk road... All other orders were received in 2 weeks=
 or less. Maybe in this case the squeaky wheels got the oil/acid. <br><br>I=
 was a little surprised when he didn't ask for my shipping address again wh=
en the "reship" was supposedly sent 2-3 weeks ago. Seems strange that he wo=
uld still have that info around. I messaged him roughly 5 days ago for a st=
atus update and did finally receive a response yesterday. I don't mind slow=
 responses as long as there are responses. Though his communications indica=
te he's an upstanding person who will take care of it, I've been through th=
is before a year and a half ago on OVDB with Tarpaulin. I was led on with=
 promises my sheet would be delivered for over 6 months. This is the worse=
 part of a scam. Just send me a message saying it's not coming and laugh at=
 the fact that you got one over on me. At least I'm only out a quarter shee=
t this time if it doesn't come. =3D/<br><br>I just want what I paid for...=
 At least I've learned a valuable lesson about being trusting and finalizin=
g early. My Buyer Stats should be enough by now that I shouldn't have to.=
 Although I did feel it was a nice courtesy to the truly amazing and upstan=
ding vendors here to get them their funds a little faster. <br><br>Good luc=
k to everyone else waiting. And my best regards to NSC, I certainly wouldn'=
t want the bad karma of ripping people off hanging over my head.=C2=A0 But=
 I have a conscience. <br><br>

				I'm at 3 months since I placed my order for 25 and FE'd like a dumb ass=
. At this point I'm getting VERY frustrated with this guy. I'd take back ev=
ery bad thing I said about him if he actually came through. But as of now=
 90 FUCKING DAYS and nothing. He told me 25 days ago that he would "Check=
 with his shippers" and I've had no response since. Bad business. Wouldn't=
 recommend this guy to my worst enemy right now. I love how he hasn't even=
 showed up to comment in here. He just logs in to SR cashes his coins out=
 and says fuck it....

				I placed my original order Nov. 6 2012. It is Feb 4 2013 today. It's be=
en 26 days since he said he would reship it ASAP and now has been avoiding=
 my messages for the past 8-10 days. I've been super patient about this. I=
 ordered 50 tabs and FE'd. I was always super polite while messaging him an=
