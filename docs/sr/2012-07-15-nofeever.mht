				If its domestic, reasonably priced, your interested and have the bitcoi=
ns, man i would go for it, chances are you might get lucky and he might gen=
erous on the scales to get a really good review. Also no FE the name speaks=
 for itself, i would be pouncing on that shit if i was you. You will always=
 have the escrow protecting your purchase.

 of the best acid I I have had in a while. 4 day shipping and he answered=

 high enough, in which case I will be able to do it weekly! With this I wil=

 only have a day or two to get the packages out, and due to that I just sim=
ply cannot offer 5strips, as that would take way to much time to the point=
 of not being able to finish packaging.<br><br>After the first batch goes=
 out though I might be able to work something out that will allow me to con=
sistently be sending out orders, which would mean those 5strips would be up=
, as well as larger orders going out daily, but at this point in time its=
 simply impossible for me to be doing that.
