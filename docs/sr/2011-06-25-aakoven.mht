				Ok, here's my review of aakoven's wonderful wonderful product.<br><br>T=
he first day I got it I took about 65mg just to see how it worked; kinda st=
upid, but spur of the moment. Definitely got something off of it, but a lit=
tle regretful that I had bumped up my tolerance for the second roll I had=
 planned the following day.<br><br>Second day I took about 130mg with my gf=
 and she took 100mg. Absolutely wonderful; very mellow, very little jaw cle=
nch, not really experiencing any comedown today; feel great. We did take 50=
mg apiece about 1:30 after the initial dose, but all that really did was ma=
ke the post-peak time last longer. Smoking weed about 5 hours after taking=
 it kicked some of the effects back in. We took it at 4:30, and got to slee=
p around 2:30. Could've gone to sleep much earlier, but it was a beautiful=
 night so we made the most of it. I'd say total rolling-face time was about=
 3 hours, with pleasant post-peak effects going on for 4-5 hours afterwards=
 (although you gotta account for the weed in there, as I'm sure it prolonge=
d things).<br><br>I should say that I probably have a bit of a tolerance to=
 what any amphetamine/methamphetamine-ish substance does to you, as I've ta=
ken Adderall for 12 years, and more recently Desoxyn for the past few month=
s. I dunno if having this available to me the day after helps negate any co=
medown effects, but all things considered I felt as right as rain the day=
 after.<br><br>It hits you like a train made out of pillows, as good molly=
 should. Usually right after you think "shit, I don't think it's doing anyt=
hing...". We put it in gelcaps, took a little under an hour to hit. I'm sur=
e that would happen sooner if you just pinky-dipped or parachuted it. Never=
 snorted molly, and from the reports I've read it doesn't really seem worth=
 it to me. If you order from him, enjoy it. I think we've got access to som=
e of the best molly available in the world right now. This right here is wh=
at the internet is made for. :) <br><br>AAkoven, many many thanks for being=
 a kickass vendor with impeccable product.<br><br>

				There was a thread with AAKoven's out of escrow feedback, but it got lo=

 no profit from helping me out, not only that - he actually put 50 EUR wort=

				AAkoven seems like a pretty respected seller but unfortunately I didn't=
 have the best experience with him. About a month and a half ago I bought=
 a gram of his MDMA (gray batch) and he said it was shipped out merely an=
 hour or 2 after I ordered. Communication with him was great and he was alw=
ays really quick to respond.<br><br>Unfortunately the package never showed=
 and it is now many weeks later. Surprisingly I never got a customs letter=
 either, so I can only assume the mailman took it or the customs letter was=
 lost in the mail. I really do believe that AAkoven mailed it out because=
 of his good reputation, but I was just a little surprised that he doesn't=
 offer partial refunds or anything. I talked to him and he said he would do=
 a re-ship, but I would have to pay an extra $30-40 dollars or so for it.=
 I decided its not worth the risk of losing more money. He initially said=
 he would refund what I paid for it and then when I said that would be grea=
t, he said he didn't know how much BTC I paid and that he would rather me=
 just do a resend.<br><br>Anyways he seems like a good guy and a good selle=
r but I think I just had bad luck with my order. So just a small warning fo=
r anyone who lives in the US, if your package gets confiscated or stolen yo=
u will most likely have to pay more for a reship.

				I'd updated one of the, like, four aakoven threads about a week ago, pr=
aising his quality packaging, communication, and shipping time (6 days -&gt=
; midwest!). Since then, I've had a chance to try the product, and it was=
 a fantastic time... I didn't feel super-speedy, nor was I completely floor=
ed - probably due to just doing lots of spaced dips instead of large initia=
l dose supplemented by a booster. But let me tell you, I danced for almost=
 five hours straight, and that time FLEW by. Thank you for the great experi=
ence, aakoven. I will certainly order from you again! <br><br>Seller gets=
 a 5/5, and I wouldn't worry one bit about finalizing early if you're a new=
 buyer. aakoven is a wonderful vendor.=C2=A0 =C2=A0

				I tried some for the first time last weekend. I have purchased from him=
 3 times, but this was the first time I have had the chance to try any!<br>=
<br>=C2=A0I was home alone and I will be going away for a month for work wh=
ere I wont be able to do anything so thought I would indulge and test this=
 stuff out.<br><br>My scales aren't very accurate with anything under a gra=
m, so I measured it all up by eye. First up I had about I'd say 150mg. (I=
 split the gram into 10 evenish lines, then split half of those up into ano=
ther 10 and put them all in caps... Pretty dodgy haha) Didn't really notice=
 the come up at all as I was just laying in bed listening to music, but the=
n all of a sudden I was rolling really hard. I looked up at the computer sc=
reen and I was seeing double so hard (the screens looked about 2m away from=
 each other, that's how messed up my vision was haha). Trying to focus on=
 the screen was really hard, but I finally got there because I wanted to pu=
t some trance music on. It has never sounded so good before!! And the body=
 rushes were probably the best I've ever had. <br><br>Throughout the night,=
 I had some tiny lines here and there. I was as cooked as I'd ever been, so=
 I'm glad I wasn't out in public! Most amazing feeling ever, it was a shame=
 that I was home alone. Wish that any of my housemates would have come home=
, because I would have loved a chat! Euphoria was out of this world. I'm gl=
ad that I got to test it out anyway before using it out at a club or someth=
ing. Just to know how strong it really is. Will definitely have to invest=
 in some proper scales, just because I feel that the difference between 100=
mg and 150mg would be pretty intense.<br><br>I've been rolling for about 10=
 years now, and that was probably the most amazing roll I've had in terms=
 of body rushes and euphoria. Can't wait to see what it's like around other=
 people!! =3D) =3D) <br><br>Just made another order half hour ago and he ha=
s already replied and it's about to be mailed within the hour. Just about=
 quicker than ordering a pizza!!!<br><br>Friendliest vendor by far!!=20

				I am a new buyer and I orders 200 pills from AAKOVEN about 6 weeks ago.=

 arrived. I also orders 1g cocaine and 10 LSD blotters on the same day that=
 I orders the pills and both of those arrived after 3 weeks. They were both=
 waiting in my post box together. I do not believe that both packages were=
 stolen because that is just unfuckingbelievable! What are the chances that=
 both packages from the same vendor get stolen and everything makes it thro=
