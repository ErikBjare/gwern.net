RT REVISONS, DETAILED ADDITIONS TO THIS GUIDE AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFOR=
MATION written by a much more experienced roader whom I consider a true SR=
 GURU</code></pre><br>So here we go:<br><br>1) THROUGH TOR go to www.blockc=
hain.info set up an account (use a mailinator or any disposable email to re=
gister)<br><br>2) Login to blockchain and click on 'Wallet'<br><br>3) Click=
 on 'Receive Money'. there you'll see your bitcoin address.=C2=A0 (a bitcoi=
n address looks something like this: 2tnMhKfSAf97f4wJcqTu6dr8toj6iaxy7y)<br=
><br>4) Go to www.bitinstant.com=C2=A0 =C2=A0(through TOR)<br>You'll see:<b=
r>- Pay From: select 'Major Bank Branch'<br>- Pay To: select 'Bitcoin Addre=
ss'<br>Underneath you'll see:<br>- Bitcoin Address: put your bitcoin addres=
s from Blockchain. best thing to do is simply COPY your bitcoin address fro=
m blockchain and PASTE it here.<br>- Amount: whatever your lovely heart des=
ires<br>- Email: put in a random mailinator address<br><br>5) You will now=
 be directed to a Trustcash site.<br>- submit your zip code and click 'Choo=
se Location' for the closest bank to you<br>- enter a fake name. enter your=
 mailinator email you used for Bitinstant<br>- click "Create deposit invoic=
e"<br><br>6) click 'Print Deposit Invoice'<br>- you now have your paper pri=
nted out and ready to bring to the bank.<br>- this paper has NO information=
 or details about your fake name, NO mention of anything bitcoin related..=
 absolutely NOTHING is on this paper but an account and routing number.<br>=
<br>7) Go to the bank with this printed paper and cash<br>- give the bank=
 teller the paper. she will simply read the account and routing number off=
 the paper and take your cash. then she'll probably give you back the paper=
 and an invoice.<br>- if asked, simply say you're paying a bill. they never=
 ask.. never happens.<br>- absolutely NO ID is required. if asked for it,=
 grunt and say you never needed it before and you left it at home.. but the=
y won't ask. just never happens.<br><br>- remember paying bills at a bank=
 is an everyday completely normal thing. millions of people go to banks dai=
ly depositing cash into people's or business's accounts for legitimate regu=
lar reasons.<br>- also remember buying bitcoins is LEGAL. <br><br>That's it=
. the bitcoins will show up in your Blockchain wallet literally within minu=
tes.<br><br>theoretically you could send your bitcoins directly to SR now,=
 but lets play it safe and "launder" your coins to blot out any sort of "pa=
per trail". The idea behind laundering your coins is obvious: erase the lin=
k between the coins and you. So don't be impatient / lazy. Follow these eas=
y steps to guarantee your anonymity.<br><br>1) Go to www.instawallet.org (t=
hrough TOR) and it will give you your own personal secret site with your ow=
n unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page becau=
se if you lose this link, you lose anything in it.<br>- instawallet is a te=
mporary e-wallet. each time you refresh the site you receive a unique rando=
mized bitcoin address and a new secret link.<br><br>2) Now go back to your=
 Blockchain wallet and click on "Send Money"<br>- simply enter your Instawa=
llet bitcoin address and the amount<br>- Send payment<br><br>Now your bitco=
ins have been sent from Blockchain to your Instawallet.<br><br>The next 2=
 steps are optional and not necessary,=C2=A0 can be skipped. BUT if you're=
 meticulous and rightfully PARANOID like me, you should continue with the=
 next 2 easy steps. If you don't give a fuck, go ahead and skip to step 5.<=
br><br>3) Now open up a an Easywallet (through TOR) page, which will give=
 you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second temporary e wallet=
 address. (bookmark also)<br><br>4) Send your bitcoins from your first Inst=
awallet page to your Easywallet page.<br><br>5) now go to SR, and click on=
 Account<br>- there you'll see your SR bitcoin address<br><br>6) Go to your=
 Easywallet that has your coins, and simply enter your SR bitcoin address=
 and press send!<br><br>That's it, my darling friends!<br><br>Just be patie=
nt and within a few HOURS or less you'll see your bitcoins in your SR accou=
nt READY for your rascally crusades!<br><br>If you're truly of the deranged=
, super paranoid kind you SHOULD use a site called BitcoinFog. It's a servi=
ce that takes your coins and tumbles them to SHREDS, completely washing or=
 BLEACHING them for several hours or even days. your coins are IMMACULATELY=
 CLEAN.<br><br>you can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addit=
ion to them. depends on your level of paranoia.<br><br>Some alternatives an=
d different options:<br>- Some people skip Instawallet altogether and only=
 use bitcoinfog alone which serves it's purpose just fine. Bitcoinfog is tr=
uly amazing.<br><br>So to simplify the whole thing, you have many formulas=
 to choose from:<br><br>- bitinstant &gt; bitcoin software &gt; bitcoinfog=
 &gt; SR =3D EXCELLENT!<br>- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &g=
t; instawallet &gt; SR=C2=A0 =C2=A0=3D=C2=A0 considered safe, fast and secu=
re. appropriate for most of us.<br>- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instaw=
allet=C2=A0 &gt; SR=C2=A0 =3D=C2=A0 good enough for some, not for me. faste=
st<br>- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR=C2=A0 =3D safer=
, slightly slower since you need to wait for bitcoinfog to do it's tumbling=
.<br>- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; bi=
tcoin fog &gt; SR=C2=A0 =3D=C2=A0 safest, ultra-paranoia stealth ninja mode=
, requires patience but provides the most peace of mind<br>- bitinstant &gt=
; Easywallet &gt; BitcoinFog &gt; SR =3D SAFEST also.<br><br>As you can see=
, you have different options depending on your patience and paranoia level.=
<br><br>Bonus useful tips:<br>1) When entering bitcoin addresses ALWAYS COP=
Y PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long ass address. Always tr=
iple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination. <br><br>=
2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example more than 1=
 week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as Easywallet or Instawall=
et. These temportary wallets are mostly useful for moving funds around. If=
 you want to store your bitcoins somewhere for a long period of time use yo=
ur Blockchain.info wallet or just keep all your bitcoins in your SR account=
. They will not disappear ever from there.<br><br>3) ALWAYS ENCRYPT YOUR AD=
DRESS (PGP) when placing orders. vendors appreciate that.<br>some vendors=
 state on their seller page listings that orders will be cancelled if the=
 address is sent unencrypted.<br><br>4) Don't use empty houses or drop loca=
tions to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that=
 the vendors use professionally printed=C2=A0 properly aligned labels with=
 your address and name in all CAPS. If you're ordering small personal use=
 amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much less risky th=
an sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look=
 for with these tricks. You can use your name slightly misspelled or altere=
d. Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that=
 lived / rented your place before.<br><br>5) PGP is highly important. Never=
 underestimate encryption for sensitive information. Encrypt your address=
 when sending to vendors ALWAYS!<br>- scroll down to find links on how to=
 learn what PGP is or it's purpose.<br><br>6) - When you're required to FE,=
 please take the time to update your feedback once you receive your items=
 so others can read and learn from your experience. We hate seeing a vendor=
 with all 5/5 feedback saying "FE, will update later" and no REVIEWS about=
 the actual product.<br>To update your feedback, go to 'Account' on SR and=
 you'll see 'View Feedback'. There you can modify / edit your feedback. Alw=
ays think about the community and how to better serve / educate us all.<br>=
<br>Basic information about ESCROW, STATS AND FE:<br><br>Another very impor=
tant topic for noobs to UNDERSTAND: Your buying stats mean so fucking much=
 for your survival in SR. If you're coming on here to scam vendors for free=
 shit, you're a piece of shit and your stats will reflect that. Once you be=
come part of SR, and you start purchasing your goodies, as a buyer you need=
 to follow the SIMPLE procedure of SR's ESCROW system. That way everyone in=
cluding you can continue to enjoy SR without unnecessary bullshit.<br><br>T=
he Escrow system is simple and brilliant. SR temporarily holds your money..=
 which means the vendor you are buying from does not receive your bitcoins=
 UNTIL you receive your order. Once you receive your order you must click=
 FINALIZE, then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor. The escrow exists=
 so both parties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with=
 each other, preventing risk and satisfying both sides. The vendor is putti=
ng his profit on hold until you finalize the transaction, so you are respon=
sible to make sure your vendor gets the money he DESERVES.<br><br>The probl=
em is a bunch of lowlifes decide to NOT finalize their orders, so these ven=
dors are out on product and the coins they deserve. These kind of shitty bu=
yers are causing more and more vendors to require FE (Finalizing Early).<br=
><br>You will see the word FE tossed around a lot. FE means Finalize Early.=
 That means your vendor will get your money before shipping your product.=
 The risk is all on your side in that case. That is why we all hate having=
 to FE because of the slight risk to us. Theoretically a shithead vendor ca=
n decide NOT to ship your product(s) after you've FE'd. Technically he is=
 paid in full and it all comes down to trusting the vendor's reputation. So=
me vendors require buyers with less than 5-10 successful transactions to FE=
. Or a vendor could request FE for an international order. All depends on=
 the vendor, the listing and circumstances. <br><br>*Added by grahamgreene:=
 "Buyers are NEVER required to FE. Finalizing Early is the choice of the bu=
yer - it is important for new users to realize that they are NOT required=
 to FE under any circumstances. If a vendor will not sell to them without=
 FE, they can choose to use a vendor that does not require FE. This is an=
 agorist marketplace, not a fascist marketplace.<br>On the topic of FE, if=
 one does choose to do so they are not forced to leave feedback there and=
 then. After clicking 'Finalize', they simply need to click on any link to=
 take them away from item feedback page, and they then leave their feedback=
 when they receive their item so as people don't see a load of "FE" feedbac=
ks."<br><br>- Never finalize early for anyone but the top 20 vendors I=E2=
=80=99d say.<br>=C2=A0<br>- Read reviews on the forum before jumping in.<br=
><br>The reason some vendors want FE is because of a few rotten pieces of=
 shits that abuse the noble, rewarding Escrow System that really makes SR=
 a satisfying stress-free place to do business.<br><br>That is precisely wh=
y your STATS mean everything on SR. Once your stats show you are a reliable=
 hassle-free buyer you can avoid having to FE. Remember that vendors screen=
 your stats just like you screen their feedback / reviews.<br><br>If you're=
 a shitty buyer vendors will simply deny serving you or make you FE. Plus=
 you're a scumbag.<br>If you're a good buyer with good stats vendors will=
 allow you to stay within escrow, and if you're lucky you might even get so=
me special treatment / perks. So work on being a good buyer if you're happy=
 with your goods / services received.<br><br>We have this ridiculously unbe=
lievable BLESSING to buy any drug imaginable with a few clicks, like shoppi=
ng on amazon. Instead of dealing with shady lowlife street dealers, we get=
 to shop for our goodies in a sophisticated way, knowing precisely what you=
're getting, with detailed descriptions about purity, brand names, and all=
 the knowledge we need to make educated, safe purchases. Instead of relying=
 on the word from moron street dealers that can't give you any of these lux=
uries. This is SOMETHING valuable we need to cherish and MAINTAIN. <br><br>=
So respect the Escrow system, that's there to CONSOLE you, respect SR's con=
duct, and HONOR THE HARMONY.. so we can keep this thing going forever. So=
 we can have easier honest transactions with vendors. And so we can show gr=
atitude to SR and the community.<br><br>--<br><br>Same principles applies=
 to the vendors. <br>Mostly we have honorable vendors that work hard to get=
 their good feedback and reputation. They provide us with good quality gear=
 and professional customer service. There are also few scumbag vendors sell=
ing garbage or selective scamming. The way our stats matter to vendors, the=
ir feedback and forum reviews immensely matter to us. We expect remarkable,=
 premium quality product and top notch service. We set our standards high=
 and there are many wonderful vendors that can accommodate our refined crav=
ings and experienced palettes with GOOD SHIT. Those vendors get the well de=
served 5/5 feedback and have the forums buzzing like crazy spreading the wo=
rd..<br><br>When you're looking for a vendor, besides the obvious best sell=
ing listings that dominate the first pages, search the forums for more deta=
iled in depth reviews..<br>You can find each drug has it's "vendor review=
 thread".=C2=A0 Those threads are packed with amazing posts by amazing peop=
le. Here in the forun you can find out about new vendors just setting up sh=
op with OUTSTANDING products. So use these forums to find the hidden gems,=
 new vendors that have FIRE shit, that want your business so their feedback=
 can grow. <br><br>Lets say your order doesn't arrive or something went wro=
ng, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. That will prompt a mini chat ty=
pe interface between you and the vendor allowing some back-n-forth discussi=
on regarding partial or full refunds, reships, or anything else that might=
 remedy the problem. Good vendors truly care about their customers so befor=
e starting a thread bashing a vendor or giving negative feedback, message=
 him/her first or go through the RESOLVE process to hopefully find a suitab=
le solution.<br>Don't make a habit of asking for refunds unless it us truly=
 genuinely necessary. Because REMEMBER: having too many refunds, or a reocc=
urring unusual patterns of problematic complaints will negatively affect yo=
ur stats!<br><br>SCAMMERS, ETC:<br>Here on SR we are a special well-bred,=
 noble breed of sophisticated drug user, defying all logic and stigma that=
 the typical drug user carries.. we try our best to maintain the MUTUAL RES=
PECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer. <br>unfortunately there will al=
ways be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it's on SR, or=
 in the streets. in the streets at least we're able to toss medium sized br=
icks directly towards their chins or jaw, but here we have something else.<=
br><br>This is very important to UNDERSTAND: scamming and any monkey busine=
ss doesn't fly here. If you have any shitty intentions I'll clearly explain=
 why you SHOULDN'T EVEN DARE OR ATTEMPT TO SCAM, or play games with vendors=
:<br><br>The vendors have their own private forum. In their forum they have=
 a BLACKLIST of BANNED CUSTOMERS that all vendors monitor and post in regul=
arly. Once you're in this list you're fucked.<br>Any buyer on here attempti=
ng to scam, not finalize their orders, score free drugs, or ANY other types=
 of remotely shady / scummy bullshit acts, will simply be ADDED and permane=
ntly LOGGED into this infamous BLACKLIST DATABASE of customers NEVER to dea=
l with. But wait, not only your username will be posted but your NAME AND=
 ADDRESS too!<br>even if you re register new SR accounts, your address / na=
me will still be on this list. This is to truly keep these shameless, thiev=
ing scoundrels / rodents away from our loving community.<br><br>There you=
 have it!<br><br>Eat your vegetables, take your multivitamin and stay hydra=
ted always.<br><br>love,<br>mrdobolina

 DETAILED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br>-----------------<br>One of our brillia=

PORTANT AND WILL GIVE YOUR FURTHER INSIGHT:<br>---------<br><br>It should=
 be noted that Mt.Gox only freezes your account when you access it via TOR,=
 but funds will be released once you verify your identity with them; it is=
 possible to gain access to your funds in Mt.Gox, but you have to give up=
 your anonymity to do so. If this happens, verify your identity, retrieve=
 your Bitcoin, then tumble the fuck out of them in order to remove any link=
s to the Bitcoin you bought on Mt.Gox and the Bitcoin you send to SR. There=
 is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use them or=
 any method of payment to buy illegal drugs.<br><br>blockchain.info, like=
 all online wallets, can not be trusted 100%. There is no guarantee that th=
ey won't run off with your Bitcoin at any time. The safest place for your=
 Bitcoin is in your Bitcoin client on your own computer, encrypted and back=

 Bitcoin address, there have been cases in the past whereby the person was=
 sending Bitcoin to a certain address by copying and pasting the address in=
to the necessary fields, but due to their computer being compromised, they=
 pasted a different Bitcoin address. What this exploit did was change the=
 address on the clipboard once it had been copied, and when the user pasted=
 the Bitcoin address into their client or E-Wallet, they were actually past=
ing the attacker's address. As you said, you should triple check you have=
 the right address, but verify it visually with first, middle and last 4 di=
gits before hitting the send button.<br>bitcoin-qt, the computer based clie=
nt, doesn't allow you to send to an address shorter than 34 characters - I'=
m unsure if E-Wallets do the same, but I would assume so as transfers can't=
 be sent to an address shorter than 34 characters, unless you input 4 or 5=
 characters of a first-bit address.<br><br>It would also be prudent after=
 hitting "Get a new address" in both your Bitcoin client and your SR accoun=
t to check that address on blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to ensure=
 it has never been used on the network before. Though it is a statistical=
 improbability, that very thing actually happened to me when I set up a new=
 receiving address in my client. For some reason I checked the address befo=

is point should not be taken as gospel, but I would imagine that most busin=
ess mail is sent with the customer's name and address in lowercase, with ca=
pitalisation only used in the necessary places. Some postal services did re=
commend in the past that details be in caps so as the machine could read it=
 more easily, but with the advent of modern scanning technology this is no=
 longer a necessity, and I believe it would make the letter / package stand=
 out amongst your other mail.<br><br>Never misspell or alter your name. You=
 want your order to blend in with your other mail as much as possible. Your=
 mailman or mailwoman will notice a misspelled name; the first time they ma=
y shrug it off, but if the see it repeatedly they may think something is up=
.<br>Put it this way: if you were ordering something from the likes of Amaz=
on or ebay, wouldn't you be sure to spell your name correctly? Your mail ha=
s to look like any other online purchase. Some people try to combine a miss=
pelled name with a "someone's trying to frame me" excuse. If someone were=
 trying to frame you with drugs that they likely spent money on, it'll be=
 someone that has a vendetta against you. You can be damn sure they'll Face=
book or Google you to ensure they spell your name correctly so the "Look,=
 they spelled my name wrong, I'm being framed!" excuse goes out the window.=
<br><br>Using the name of a previous tenant is risky as they may have set=
 up mail forwarding. Some people still receive mail for previous tenants,=
 but mail forwarding doesn't always forward all mail (junkmail etc. is ofte=
n still sent to the tenant's previous address.) By doing this, you risk you=
r purchase being forwarded to the ex-tenant.<br>Best case scenario: they us=
e drugs and think it's awesome that someone sent them a freebie.<br>Worst=
 case scenario: they receive a package of drugs or white powder in the mail=
 and immediately call the police who see your address on the package as it=
 was forwarded, thereby putting your address on their radar.<br><br>ALWAYS=
 use your real name and real address for orders. Some have had success with=
 P.O. boxes opened up with fake ID's. I have no experience with that though=

re about Resolution and Auto-Finalization:<br><br>If your order has not arr=
ived after about 13 days, hit the Resolve button. This will take your order=
 to the Resolution Center, as orngecapsule has already outlined. Here you=
 will be given the option of asking the vendor for a refund, asking for a=
 re-ship, extending the time-frame for your order to reach you or come to=
 some other agreement with your vendor. Personally, I always extend by anot=
her 5 - 7 days because the postal service, whilst usually fairly efficient,=
 does occasionally take longer than expected. If needs-be, I will extend ag=
ain.<br><br>The initial time extension begins at the end of the 17 day peri=
od (when your vendor marks your order as 'in transit', it will be 17 days=
 before the order auto-finalizes) so if you enter resolution on day 13 and=
 offer a 7 day extension, it will be 11 days (the 4 days left out of the 17=
 day period, plus the 7 days you're extending by) before it comes the atten=
tion of Resolution Center administrators again. You can ask to change the=
 terms of resolution at any time, and you can also Finalize at any time if=
 your product has arrived and the Resolution process will automatically be=
 closed.<br><br>Always enter Resolution a couple of days before the auto-fi=
nalization date. One of the things vendors hate most is expecting their mon=
ey after the 17 day period, only for the buyer to enter resolution and prop=
ose an extension 2 hours before auto-finalization. If you haven't logged in=
 for a few days and it IS a couple of hours before finalization, hit 'resol=
ve' and explain in the note section that you hadn't logged in, apologize fo=
r entering resolution so close to the auto-finalization date and propose a=
 time extension. Once an order is in the resolution center it will not auto=
-finalize.<br><br>If a % refund is requested and the amount of the refund=
 is disputed by the vendor, the matter will be settled by the administrator=
 dealing with the resolution. If the vendor has a specific refund policy,=
 then you have agreed to that upon ordering and that is the refund that you=
 will receive, if any. If the vendor can produce a DCN proving that the ite=
m in question was sent, then the proof backs up the vendor and SR will usua=
lly side with them. However, the reputation of both the member and the vend=
or and their respective Purchasing / Selling stats will also weigh in on th=

br><br>http://brainwallet.org/ - The most secure and paranoid option of all=
 is the brain wallet =E2=80=93 storing a bitcoin address and private key en=
tirely in your brain. This is easier than it sounds: a private key is 256=
 bits long, so it is about as hard to memorize as 50 words of English prose=
 or 10 phone numbers, although you can settle for even less than that at th=
e expense of some security.<br><br>There are three ways to create a brain=
 wallet. The first, and most obvious, is to create an address/private key=
 pair with bitaddress.org, blockchain.info or vanitygen and memorize it as=
 is. However, this option is the most difficult to memorize. The second is=
 to generate an address/private key pair and use a tool like Grondilu=E2=80=
=99s Bitcoin Bash Tools or the Electrum wallet to generate a list of words=
 from the private key which you can more easily memorize, and then use the=
 tool to convert back when you need to. The third is to do the reverse =E2=
=80=93 create the private key from the passphrase, which you can choose you=
rself. Since almost any 256-bit value can be used as a private key with Bit=
coin=E2=80=99s ECDSA cryptography, you can take the SHA256 hash of any pass=
word or phrase (the tools for this are very widely available both online an=
d offline) and then import the result into the blockchain.info wallet in of=
fline mode to get the address for that key. The process for sending bitcoin=
s is exactly the same as that for offline/paper wallets: use a tool to crea=
te the transaction offline, and then use an online computer to publish it.<=

				BASIC TERMINOLOGY / GLOSSARY:<br>--------------------------------------=
-------------<br><br>TOR - Tor (short for The Onion Router) is a system int=
ended to enable online anonymity. Tor client software routes Internet traff=
ic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers in order to conceal a=
 user=E2=80=99s location or usage from someone conducting network surveilla=
nce or traffic analysis. =E2=80=93 (Wikipedia)<br><br>BITCOIN WALLET - A Bi=
tcoin client is a piece of software that handles receiving and sending bitc=
oins. The most popular is the standard Bitcoin client downloadable from bit=
coin.org, although there are many other options with different features.<br=
>You can either download your bitcoin client (preferred) or used a web-base=
d bitcoin wallet. (blockchain, mtgox, etc)<br><br>The term wallet can have=
 two meanings: it can either be a synonym for a Bitcoin client (although th=
e terms are in practice used slightly differently, =E2=80=9Cclient=E2=80=9D=
 referring more to fully fledged desktop clients and =E2=80=9Cwallet=E2=80=
=9D more to lightweight browser-based and online managed services) or it ca=
n refer to a file which stores bitcoin addresses and the private keys neede=
d to use them.<br><br>BITCOIN ADDDRESS - A Bitcoin address is a string like=
 =E2=80=9C13ignD31FysQbaBBVJUzffcQoFxxEuEcbE=E2=80=9D that you need to know=
 from someone to send bitcoins to them. The process of creating a bitcoin=
 address and the private key going along with it can be done by bitcoin cli=
ents.<br><br>PRIVATE KEY - A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a key=
 connected to an address (technically, the address is the hash of the publi=
c key corresponding to the private key) that is stored behind the scenes an=
d allows you to send bitcoins that have been previously sent to that addres=
s. Note that because of the way the encryption algorithm that Bitcoin uses=
 (ECDSA) works it is possible to generate the public key and the address fr=
om just the private key.<br><br>FE - Finalize Early. When you're asked to=
 finalize (pay him before he ships) early by the vendor.<br><br>PGP - stand=
s for Pretty Good Privacy. PGP is useful for two things: 1. Privacy and Sec=
urity, and 2. Authenticity.<br>By privacy, I mean that you can prevent peop=
le from seeing things. For example, you can encrypt an email to someone, or=
 encrypt a file with a list of passwords.<br>By Authenticity, I mean that=
 you can ensure a message was sent/written by the person you think it was,=
 and that it wasn't modified by a third party. Of course, these two can be=
 combined.<br><br>PGP is basically used for 4 things. (stolen from http://a=
xion.physics.ubc.ca/pgp-begin.html#intro)<br><br>a) Encrypting a message or=
 file so that only the recipient can decrypt and read it. The sender, by di=
gitally signing with PGP, can also guarantee to the recipient, that the mes=
sage or file must have come from the sender and not an impostor. (So you ca=
n send a coded, signed e-mail to your lover and ONLY your lover will be abl=
e to decode it and your lover will KNOW that the e-mail came from you.)<br>=
<br>b) Clear signing a plain text message guarantees that it can only have=
 come from the sender and not an impostor. In a plain text message, the tex=
t is readable by anyone (i.e. is 'plain') but a PGP digital signature is at=
tached. So, Alice posts some comments about black holes to one of the sci.a=
stro news groups. She mustn't encrypt the comments because she WANTS people=
 to read them. But Alice wants anyone with PGP to know that it was her who=
 posted the comments - so Alice digitally signs the posting with PGP. nb Al=
ice and all other PGP users can subsequently prove that she posted the comm=
ents. Be careful about what you put in signed postings as it is difficult=
 to deny, later, that the contents of a message were sent by you!<br><br>c)=
 Encrypting computer files so that they can't be decrypted by anyone other=
 than the person who encrypted them. (So, you CAN stop your family reading=
 your poetry.)<br><br>d) Really deleting files (i.e. overwriting the conten=
t so that it can't be recovered and read by anyone else) rather than just=
 removing the file name from a directory/folder. (So, you can obliterate of=
fensive stuff from your PC.)=C2=A0 (stolen from some ehow type site)<br><br=
>GPG - Gnu Privacy Guard and Pretty Good Privacy -- also referred to as GPG=
 and PGP, respectively -- are data encryption and decryption solutions used=
 for transferring and storing information securely. GPG and PGP are nearly=
 identical, with the major difference between them being how they are licen=
sed to the public.<br><br>if you're really interested to learn the differen=
ce between GPG and PGP : http://www.ehow.com/info_12225332_difference-betwe=
en-gpg-pgp.html#ixzz26DXDNpJy <br><br>E-Wallet - a temporary bitcoin wallet=
. Examples are Instawallet, Easywallet, etc<br><br>ESCROW - Simply defined,=
 an escrow is a deposit of funds, a deed or other instrument by one party=
 for the delivery to another party upon completion of a particular conditio=
n or event. <br>On SR Escrow's system, SR temporarily holds your money.. wh=
ich means the seller you are buying from does not receive your bitcoins UNT=
IL you receive your order. Once you receive your order you click FINALIZE,=
 then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor. The escrow exists so both pa=
rties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with each other,=
 preventing risk and satisfying both sides. The vendor is putting his profi=
t on hold until you finalize the transaction, so the buyer is responsible=
 to make sure his/her vendor gets the bitcoins. And the vendor is responsib=
le to make sure his/her buyer gets the product(s).<br><br>LAUNDER - to "was=
h" your coins meaning to remove or obscure all trace or record of where the=
 COINS originally came from. (Example: Jim buys his bitcoins from Mt Gox bu=
t he doesn't want anyone to know that, so he uses services to ERASE the foo=
tprints and record that they came from MT Gox.)<br>Tumbling refers to "tumb=
ling your coins in a washing machine" to clean them.<br><br>LIBERTE - Liber=
t=C3=A9 Linux is a secure, reliable, lightweight and easy to use Gentoo-bas=
ed LiveUSB/SD/CD Linux distribution with the primary purpose of enabling an=
yone to communicate safely and covertly in hostile environments. Whether yo=
u are a privacy advocate, a dissident, or a sleeper agent, you are equally=
 likely to find Libert=C3=A9 Linux useful as a mission-critical communicati=
on aid. (stolen from dee.su/liberte)<br><br>LE - Law Enforcement, AKA pigle=
ts, AKA the main enemy attempting to cripple SR. <br>If you're one and read=
ing this, get assraped by 6 black cocks and cummed on several times by seve=
ral sources preferably that have AIDS - SR will always exist, no matter how=
 many stings you attempt, or how much "intel" you think you might have. Wel=
come to the future. Accept it and stop wasting time trying to FUCK WITH US.=
<br>Just like Torrents will always exist .. DRUGS ONLINE will always exist,=
 so why bother even trying?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>MORE GENERAL=
 INFORMATION AND GATHERED RESEARCH:<br><br>If you are worried enough about=
 your security to be using PGP, than you should most definitely not being=
 using=C2=A0 windows to access the silk road or any other part of the darkn=
et.<br>for one example of one of the many dangers of using windows, there=
 is a thread around here about how windows 7 (and possibly other versions)=
 keeps a constant 10mb/s encrypted connection with the NSA. and although it=
 is not know what that connection is sending, a lot of signs point to compl=
ete surveillance of everything yhat you do on the machine. That alone shoul=
d be enough to make any SR user fear windows. And some people (myself inclu=
ded) believe that Mac systems have similar issues<br><br>You should really=
 be using a linux LiveUSB to access SR. Not only is it a million times safe=
r, but the PGP programs in the ones designed for anonymity are much easier=
 to use than gpg4win, and it pretty much already set up for you.<br><br>fol=

sit through TOR)<br><br>--<br><br>TIPS FROM OTHER FORUM POSTERS:<br><br>ope=
ntoe's advice:<br>The ONLY way I access SR or anything to do with it is usi=
ng MS VirtualPC. The entire OS is encapsulated in one big VM file. I think=
 it is better then a USB card since I can lose that or someone can take it.=
 If I have to ditch my VM quickly I can just delete the entire VM itself.=
 Then I can use SDELETE multiple times on my drive. Then I'm safe. Now, if=
 the ever chance I got busted on and charged through my door i may have a=
 hard time doing all that. This is why I created a batch file which I just=
 double click on that will erase the VM and run sdelete automatically. Ther=
e are also hard drive killer programs out there that I may check out too.=
 Also, when you communicate private/sensitive information ALWAYS use PGP.=
 If you don't know how to use it, then LEARN IT. Never use a vendor that do=
esn't at least provide it.<br><br>--<br><br>Delta11's advice:<br>Secure Tor=
 Setup:<br>-Install TAILS on a usb stick or a cd if you're paranoid that yo=
u might leave data on the usb (cd is read-only)<br>-Get a second usb/memory=
 card and encrypt it using truecrypt but make sure to encrypt with a hidden=
 partition.<br>-Select an easy/crackable password for the outer volume and=
 then make the password for the hidden partition very strong/secure.<br>-On=
 your outer volume put embarrassing things (Pictures of your ex, naked pics=
 of dudes, etc) that way if you're ever forced to decrypt your drive you'll=
 just facepalm and say "Okay you found my secret you asshole."<br>-On your=
 hidden partition keep all of your sensitive info and make sure to even PGP=
 text files just in case.<br>-Try to connect to a neighbor's wifi, chances=
 are there are some unsecured ones. If there aren't any unsecured networks=
 then check to see if any of them are locked with WEP, they are easy to cra=
ck but you'll have to figure that out on your own. <br><br>---<br><br>pine'=
s advice:<br>Go onto Tor and download bitcoin wallet software -&gt;=C2=A0=
 Printscreen http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor instructions -&gt; Turn off inte=
rweb -&gt; Install and torify your bitcoin wallet software -&gt; Turn on in=
terweb and download the block chain to torified bitcoin wallet, now you are=
 ready to proceed -&gt; On clearnet, access your exchange account with the=
 bitcoins -&gt; Make an instawallet/online bitcoin wallet provider account=
 through clearnet -&gt; transfer bitcoins from exchange to instawallet -&gt=
; transfer from instawallet to your torified bitcoin wallet -&gt; Open new=
 instawallet with Tor -&gt; transfer from torified bitcoin wallet to instaw=
allet on Tor -&gt; Optionally transfer to a bitcoin mixing service -&gt; wa=
it a couple of hours/days -&gt; transfer from mixing service or online wall=
et to SR.<br><br>--<br>pkinkman's advice:<br>If you have access to cash now=
 and went to make a purchase today here's the easiest way:<br><br>1. Buy Mo=
neypak. (Up to $300=C2=A0 at 7-11 or $1100 at Wallmart)<br>2. Purchase BTC=
 from SR vendor with MoneyPak, ideally Coinbox as his fee is only 1-2%. "BT=
C Buddy" is also reliable exchanger although his 10% is more than I would=
 pay. Not sure what Vlad charges but you should PM any of these vendors to=
 work out a rate.<br>3. Buy drugs of choice with funds from your freshly to=
pped up SR btc account.<br>4. Wait in agony while anticipating the arrival=
 of your freshly purchased drugs.<br>5. Do drugs.<br><br><br>MORE ADVICE:<b=
r>1. Don't have your clearnet browser and Tor browser open at the same time=
.<br>2. Never use a Bitcoin address more than once.<br>3. Search forum for=
 bitcoin mixing services and online bitcoin wallet providers.<br>4. If you=
 think you see flaws, you point them out. The only stupid question is one=
 never asked.<br>5. Although the above procedures might make you more paran=
oid, you should really sleep a whole lot sounder since every service you've=
 used from the exchange to the Silk Road itself could be compromised and it=
 wouldn't matter a whole lot.<br>6. Clearnet means being on the normal web=
 and you're not using Tor software. Darknet is the opposite.<br>7. To torif=
y something means that its internet traffic is being routed though the Tor=
 network.<br>8. Don't access exchange websites with Tor, period. Unless you=
're doing what I described above<br>9. Don't access any website with Tor e.=
g. your instawallet, and then access the same web address/URL using Tor. No=
w instawallet knows who you are if you do.<br>10. Under no circumstances,=
 none, forward bitcoins from A to B and then put the bitcoins back into a=
 wallet you used earlier. This is circumstantial evidence that all bitcoin=
 activity in that loop belongs to a single entity.<br>11. The larger the qu=
antities being transacted, the more you want to be thinking about ferrying=
 varying amounts of bitcoin over time with different Tor identities. I beli=
eve there is bitcoin software that can do this for you, future scheduled de=
posits that is, and your Tor software periodically changes identity anyway.=
<br><br><br>--<br>MISC ALTERNATIVE ADVICE #1:<br><br>The best practice is=
 to treat Bitcoin like a bank with multiple accounts. You find a secure mac=
hine, whether it's a Linux LiveCD or whatever and create a new wallet. Writ=
e down the address. Encrypt the wallet (using Truecrypt or whatever else)=
 and put it on a USB stick. Hell, make two USB sticks.<br><br>Throw it in=
 your safe. Keep another elsewhere. Treat it like a huge pile of cash you=
 can keep backups of, but no one can really steal.<br><br>Keep a secondary=
 wallet on your PC. Think of it as your checking account. Once you have an=
 uncomfortable amount of funds, or before that point, transfer some of it=
 off to your primary wallet (your savings account).<br><br>What will be use=
ful after this is to get a Bitcoin Linux LiveCD specifically for accessing=
 your primary wallet. If you need to access your 25,000BTC stash, you boot=
 from that LiveCD, pop in your USB stick, and do your business.<br><br>That=
's the only way you're ever going to have real security with your Bitcoin=
 funds<br><br>--<br>MISC ALTERNATIVE ADVICE #2:<br><br>- Acquire a cheap ne=
tbook/pc/toaster, the 'cleaner' the better, i.e. new in box is best. NEVER=
 CONNECT THIS MACHINE TO THE NET<br>- Acquire some flash/external hds/print=
er/cd burner or other long term storage/backup media usable from your Bitty=
 Bank.<br>- Use the media you got to put a verified copy of the bitcoin cli=
ent on your Bitty Bank, generate a wallet. Back up this wallet using the me=
dia mentioned.<br>- Destroy your bitty bank, or at least give it a good str=
ong wipe.<br><br>YOU NOW HAVE A SECURE AIR-GAPPED ONE-WAY BITCOIN BANK<br><=
br>And perhaps you also see why I term this the 'Bitty Bank'. You can put=
 funds in but not take them out until your ready to 'break' it.<br><br>To=
 'break' your Bitty Bank, you have to connect it to the net and send whatev=
er money you want to withdrawal. Unfortunately at this point your Bitty Ban=
k is potentially compromised. The trick, is that you can have a new secure=
 Bitty Bank set up to receive the excess funds at the same make your desire=
d withdrawal from busted bank.<br><br>Why this should work From my understa=
nding, it is not necessary for the Bitcoin recipient to come online within=
 any given time-frame.<br><br>I've also observed that it is possible to cre=
ate new wallets, without any net connection.<br><br>Since Bitcoin is really=
 just a distributed ledger, this makes a lot of sense, your not actually se=
nding anything to the recipient, your just logging that you want that perso=
n to have the concept of X.XX Bitcoin.<br><br>This being the case, it is ne=
ver necessary to have your wallet on a net-connected machine until you inte=
nd to send bitcoins.<br><br>---<br>MISC ALTERNATIVE ADVICE #3:<br><br>Pick=
 a machine to dedicate to bitcoin. I will refer to this as "bitbank". It do=
esn't need much in terms of hardware specs, just needs to run. The paranoid=
 may wish to check for hardware keyloggers and such, but it shouldn't reall=
y matter, as you will be keeping it physically secure.<br><br>Whip the HD=
 and install a secure OS. Should be something secure and reliable. Debian=
 would be a good choice. Use full disk encryption. This will serve more as=
 a barrier against tampering with the software (eg installing software keyl=
oggers) than protecting the data.<br><br>Do not install any additional soft=
ware on the computer, or even brows the web on it. Yes, it should be okay=
 as long as you use reputable software, etc. But we are being paranoid here=
. There could be security flaws anywhere. Only use it for bitcoin<br><br>Di=
sable any "dangerous" software running on the machine. This is pretty much=
 just ssh or other remote login software. I'm pretty sure this isn't an iss=
ue in Debian, but I haven't done a desktop install for a while.<br><br>Inst=
all bitcoin. Use official repos when possible, since this should be a signe=
d package.<br><br>** Use your new bitbank.** Just send coins to it's addres=
s when you want, start it up only when you want to remove coins. Monitor th=
e distro's site for any crucial security updates and do them, but other tha=
n that you are good.<br><br>Keep it physically secure. No software protects=
 you against an attacker planting a hardware keylogger in your machine. A=
 safe or bank vault would be a good idea.<br><br>--<br><br><br>MISC TIPS:<b=

blem is a bunch of lowlifes decide to NOT finalize their orders, so these=

.<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botslice_quote">=
</div></div><br>Has the author used SR before? This isnt how this works. No=
rmally the vendor will ship first, and once the product is marked as shippe=
d the transaction will go into the auto-finalization stage where unless the=
 buyer disputes the transaction it will auto finalize in 17 days unless the=
 buyer finalizes manually first. There is no option simply to NOT pay, if=
 you feel cheated by the vendor you can go into resolution. Perhaps the buy=
ers can scam the vendors by filing bogus disputes, but this shows poorly on=
 buyer stats and will most likely get said buyer blacklisted. For new buyer=
s, vendors will require them to finalize early so they dont have to deal wi=
th potential one-off scammers filing bogus disputes to get out of paying.=

 never had a problem with this.=C2=A0 Even if my house was raided, there is=
 rarely any illegal contraband around.=C2=A0 In the event there is somethin=

 a wealth of information about anything you need to know and is also a fant=
