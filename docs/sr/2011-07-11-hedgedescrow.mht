				***Update***<br>It has been about a month and a half now since we intro=
duced the hedged escrow feature, and I am happy to say it has worked really=
 well!=C2=A0 If you don't know what that is, check out the buyer's and sell=
er's guides.=C2=A0 There has been plenty of market volatility over this tim=
e and the system has balanced out irregardless of what the exchange rate ha=
s done, exactly as it should.=C2=A0 We've been tracking all of the numbers,=
 and have found that sellers will lose about 4% of their payment when using=
 the escrow hedge.=C2=A0 This is due to the bid/ask spread and slippage in=
 the markets, especially at times when the bitcoin markets are thin.=C2=A0=
 Basically, when the payment is hedged, the lowest available "ask" prices=
 adding up to the price of the order are used.=C2=A0 Then, when it is unhed=
ged, the highest available "bid" prices adding up to the price of the order=
 are used.=C2=A0 So, if you are willing to forgo this 4% or so, or raise yo=
ur prices by 4%, for the security and predictability of being protected fro=
m exchange rate fluctuations while your payments are in escrow, then I reco=
mmend you enable escrow hedging on your settings page :)<br><br>-----BEGIN=
 PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA1<br><br>Probably the longest standing=
 and most important feature request to date is finally here.=C2=A0 Sellers=
 now have the option to hedge their escrow balances against fluctuations in=
 the BTC/USD exchange rate.=C2=A0 Our hope is that this will bring some muc=
h needed predictability and stability to the transaction process and allow=
 sellers to price their items with confidence.=C2=A0 Detailed explanations=
 can be found in the buyer's and seller's guides.<br><br>Please note that=
 this feature is experimental at the moment and we reserve the right to dea=
ctivate it without notice.=C2=A0 Deactivating won't affect current hedged=
 orders.=C2=A0 It will only prevent future hedging.<br><br>cheers<br><br>--=

				From the Sellers Guide: <br><br>"Escrow Hedging<br>DISCLAIMER: at this=
 point, escrow hedging is experimental and we reserve the right to disconti=
nue it without notice.<br><br>Unfortunately, the bitcoin exchange rate isn'=
t as stable as we would all like it to be, and can fluctuate wildly in a ma=
tter of hours, let alone the days or weeks it takes for a package to arrive=
. Because of this, there is a real danger that the bitcoins being held in=
 your escrow account will lose value by the time your customers finalize th=
eir orders. So, we've given you the option to hedge the future payments you=
 are expecting from escrow such that the dollar value of the payment doesn'=
t change as the bitcoin exchange rate changes.<br><br>For example, someone=
 purchases one of your 10 btc listings. The dollar value of the order when=
 purchased is $100. Now, a week later when the transaction is finalized, th=
ose 10 btc are no longer worth $100, they're worth $50! Because you hedged=
 the escrow, you won't get paid 10 btc, you'll get 20 btc equaling the orig=
inal value of $100. Of course, the opposite is also true. If bitcoins appre=
ciate in value while your payment is in escrow, you'll get fewer bitcoins,=
 but they will still equal the original dollar value.<br><br>The option to=
 turn off or on escrow hedging can be found on your "settings" page. While=
 it is on, the payments for any orders placed with you will be hedged. Paym=
ents for orders placed while it is off will not be hedged, but any hedged=
 orders still not finalized will remain hedged.<br><br>On your account page=
, your escrow balances are split up between hedged and unhedged orders. All=
 orders are unhedged until you confirm shipment, at which point, if you are=
 set to hedge, the payment for the order will show up on the dollar side of=
 your escrow balance. "

 figure it out.<br><br>Although, I thought of a related question. If a buye=

crease) where do those lost BTC go? I can only conclude that Silk Road main=

 possible there are enough canceled orders and market volatility such that=
 the collection of these Bitcoins resulting from cancellations is sufficien=

 out the reserve.<br>

				SR does make a profit from each transaction, actually, so this is prett=

 downs, will be stable enough for people in it for the long haul. Of course=
, they also make it quite clear that they reserve the right to cancel, so=
 I guess the real test is ahead.

 for collateral. Awesome guys. I know there are privacy and LEO concerns an=

				yeah, hopefully SR is not actually holding the escrow in cash by doing=
 an FX transaction for each hedge -- that would definitely be traceable sin=

 sellers have the option to hedge, and buyers simply go along for the ride=

				One possibility would be that SR mined a large number of BTC at virtual=

 idea for SR as a result.=C2=A0 This would explain the hedging issue: he ha=

				The past couple of days the BTC value diminished by about 40% at one po=
int.=C2=A0 SR didn't immediately stop the hedging, even for new orders.<br>=
If the market follows its usual pattern, the BTC will now drift up slowly=
 until it reaches 80-85% of its previous value.<br><br>As SR has shown hims=
elf to be quite adept at matters of anonymity, finance, etc. I think we can=
 safely assume that this was an event that he had foreseen when setting up=
 the hedging feature.=C2=A0 <br><br>What is not known, and will never be kn=
own, is how many of the outstanding order will actually have to be paid out=
 using the reduced BTC values before the BTC drifts upward enough that it=
 meets the average value of all the bitcoins that SR has in his possession.=
=C2=A0 Regardless of that figure, the appearance is that the depth of SR's=
 bitcoin pool is sufficient to weather a very significant devaluation of th=

				Peach, you're close, but not exactly right.=C2=A0 All of your math is=
 right.=C2=A0 Yes, the dollar amount received would be fixed for the seller=
 and the bitcoin amount would fluctuate based on the market.<br><br>However=
, the "extra" bitcoins aren't coming from any "fund", so it doesn't matter=
 at all if the market appreciates or depreciates.=C2=A0 And there is no "da=
ngerously low" situation and no one will have to "use own savings".<br><br>=
Going back to your example:<br><br>A customer buys your drivers license for=
 90 bitcoins.<br>It's hedged in dollars and 1 dollar is 3 bitcoins, so you,=
 as a seller will receive a dollar value of $270 minus fees upon finalizati=
on.<br>During the time before the customer finalizes, let's say bitcoins de=
preciate to 2 bitcoins to the dollar.=C2=A0 You would receive ($270/2 bitco=
ins) or 135 bitcoins.<br><br>Now where do these 45 "extra" bitcoins come fr=
om?<br><br>When the customer places the order, 90 bitcoins leave the custom=
er's account.=C2=A0 Then SR immediately sells 90 bitcoins to the market in=
 exchange for $270.=C2=A0 So SR now has $270, not 90 bitcoin.=C2=A0 When th=
e customer finalizes, SR uses the $270 to re-purchase bitcoins.=C2=A0 Remem=
ber during this time bitcoins depreciated to 2 bitcoins per $1, so $270 wil=
l now buy 135 bitcoins.=C2=A0 Then SR deposits those 135 bitcoins into the=
 sellers account.=C2=A0 <br><br>The fee you pay for hedging covers the cost=
 of SR having to sell then repurchase the bitcoins, plus a small margin for=
 conducting the trade for you.<br>

 the fluctuations of the market will net to zero. According to wikipedia "H=
edging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset and bal=
ance against the risk adopted by assuming a position in a contrary or oppos=
ing market or investment." So like Isa says, to hedge against fluctuations=
 in the price of bitcoins to dollars you simply buy an equivalent amount of=
 dollars. Then when the bitcoins go up the dollars go down and vice versa=
 so your position is always the same as when you began the hedge. If you ga=
ined bitcoins the extra coins come from the sale of the dollars at the high=
er rate, if you lost bitcoins the loss is realized when selling the dollars=
 for a lower amount.<br><br>SR's position is always nuetral, the gain or lo=
ss from the change in value is realized by the party that invested in the=
 coins that SR sold.
