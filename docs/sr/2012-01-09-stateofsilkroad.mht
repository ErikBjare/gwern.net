				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA1<br><br>- From it's hum=
ble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has be=
come a vibrant community full of interesting characters.=C2=A0 From our sup=
erstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the foru=
m, the people here are truly awesome.=C2=A0 Silk Road would not be what it=
 is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the wa=
y to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experi=
ment on as their own and stand with us.<br><br>It didn't take long before=
 word got out.=C2=A0 Our little hidden market got the attention of the medi=
a and soon the politicians and law enforcement.=C2=A0 But Silk Road was nev=
er meant to be private and exclusive.=C2=A0 It is meant to grow into a forc=
e to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last giv=
e people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.=C2=A0 We fundamentally=
 believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so=
 far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.=C2=A0 A revolu=
tion has been born.=C2=A0 So ideally, more participants means more prosperi=
ty.=C2=A0 What we've found in practice is that if there is an opportunity=
 to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere wi=
ll exploit it.<br><br>So, we've had two major challenges to face as Silk Ro=
ad grows and evolves.=C2=A0 One is making our systems tough enough and flex=
ible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organiz=
ations in the world, should they choose to start that war.=C2=A0 This is al=
ways and ever a top priority.=C2=A0 The other is making the market a place=
 where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything witho=
ut worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown=
 in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.<br><br=
>I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to=
 this point.=C2=A0 The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw=
 ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go=
 when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to na=
me a few).=C2=A0 And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the esc=
row system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller,=
 or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.<br><br>This success has in=
 no way made us complacent however.=C2=A0 New members are still being lured=
 into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and =E2=
=80=9Cfinalizing early=E2=80=9D, effectively cutting out the escrow process=
, is common practice.=C2=A0 Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks an=
d take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance,=
 and convenience for everyone involved.<br><br>First we must deal with trad=
ing out of escrow.=C2=A0 Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% comm=
ission on all trades.=C2=A0 This is much too high for transactions in the=
 $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions=
 much more attractive than staying within the system.=C2=A0 Now, instead of=
 charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced=
 items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does=
 it.<br><br>We've worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that sh=
ould work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send=
 money outside of escrow.=C2=A0 For some perspective, eBay and amazon charg=
e the following rates:<br><br>eBay=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0- $0.50 to list, 11%=
 of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+<br>amazon - $1.35 +=
 15% (for almost all items)<br><br>We also went to the Silk Road independen=
t sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would=
 look like.=C2=A0 The average response looked like this:<br><br>15% of the=
 first $10<br>11% of $10 - $50<br>8.14% of $50 - $250<br>5.6% of $250 - $10=
00<br>3.7% of $1000 - $5000<br><br>We looked at past sales data and our cur=
rent and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down eve=
n further:<br><br>10% of the first $50<br>8.5% of $50 - 150<br>6% of $150=
 - 300<br>3% of $300 - 500<br>2% of $500 - 1000<br>1.5% for everything over=
 $1000<br><br>With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for=
 vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.=C2=A0 Any request should be inte=
rpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via th=
e =E2=80=9Ccontact us=E2=80=9D link on the main site.=C2=A0 We are looking=
 at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self=
-policing to bounties on offenders.<br><br>Together, we can beat the scamme=
rs and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence=
 and peace of mind.=C2=A0 If we stay true to our principles of integrity,=
 virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point,=
 I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be=
 a success!<br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br>Version: GnuPG v2.0.14=

 up to facilitate bitcoin exchange and your money can be stolen without rec=

				I think the bigger problem is the amount of scammer sellers. Especially=
 scam LSD vendors. There needs to be a policy implemented for new sellers,=
 so that they cannot do out of escrow or else they will be subject to delet=

				=C2=A0I just received news about the fees increase. I have no problem=
 with the fees increase HOWEVER if i MUST keep all my transactions in escro=
w, I am effectively out of business, I cannot afford to put that much money=
 out of my pocket for a week some times ten days until the customer gets th=
eir packages! I would basically be able to sell for one day every two weeks=
 and then I would have to wait for everyone to get their mail to finalize=
 and I can reup and sell more. if we are really doing absolutely no out of=
 escrows, im in the same boat as warweed but for diff reasons, I AM OUT OF=
 BUSINESS!! Look at all my transactions so far, everyone has gotten their=
 packages and most were done out of escrow and now I cant serve these same=
 customers anymore!??!??! I believe it should be up to the buyer if they tr=
ust the vendor enough to finalizee early and, if not, to either agree to an=
 escrow or just dont do business with that vendor!!! I thought this place=
 was support to support the free market!! well, your killing my free market=
!! I HOPE THIS ISNT THE END OF WUMG00 ON SR!!!=C2=A0 :'(

 that much money out of my pocket for a week some times ten days until the=
 customer gets their packages! I would basically be able to sell for one da=
y every two weeks and then I would have to wait for everyone to get their=
 mail to finalize and I can reup and sell more. if we are really doing abso=
lutely no out of escrows, im in the same boat as warweed but for diff reaso=
ns, I AM OUT OF BUSINESS!! Look at all my transactions so far, everyone has=
 gotten their packages and most were done out of escrow and now I cant serv=
e these same customers anymore!??!??! I believe it should be up to the buye=
r if they trust the vendor enough to finalizee early and, if not, to either=
 agree to an escrow or just dont do business with that vendor!!! I thought=
 this place was support to support the free market!! well, your killing my=

				SR cut the shit imo it is pretty obvious you are just looking for more=
 money. Which is perfectly fine, running a site like SR is a full time job=
 and it isn't worth it to do it for free. But you are going to do damage to=
 the site by implementing this method of getting money. Because nobody is=
 going to do bulk deals through the escrow system. I have seen deals for 10=
 grams of crystal LSD, hundreds of thousands of tablets, kilos of MDMA etc=
 from legit vendors online, even on fairly well known drug forums. There is=
 no way in fucking hell the people doing deals like that are going to risk=
 losing to a reverse scammer. The risk has historically been on the custome=
r and even though escrow is fine for small deals and really a good model,=
 it ensures that there will never be bulk sellers. And many sellers with bu=
lk don't want to be bothered changing to small orders either. <br><br>I sug=
gest you tax big vendors on their orders, but don't make them risk losing=
 out to reverse scammers.<br><br>BTW there is an open source bitcoin mix so=
ftware being developed that is pretty cool, it decentralizes trust by requi=
ring multiple nodes to sign off on the block chain (this is a little known=
 feature built into the bitcoin spec, but that hasn't afaik been taken adva=
ntage of yet). This will allow for decentralized bitcoin mixes where no sin=
gle mix operator can steal bitcoins from a client who uses it. It also uses=
 blind signature mixing so protects from evil mix operators colluding toget=
her to deanonymize coin flows. It allows for mix nodes to charge a price fo=
r their services too. I think it will quickly turn into a commercial networ=
k of mixes when it is done and really be a great way to get truly anonymize=
d bitcoins. But anyway the reason I bring this up is that apparently escrow=
 can be decentralized and still in line with the bitcoin spec, because this=
 software (Open Transactions...look it up) decentralizes trust with bitcoin=
s in a mixing context. Soon I think people will automatically store their=
 coins constantly mixing through a distributed trust network of mix nodes=
 / addresses. <br><br>You know what you really should work on though, SR?=
 Implementing more systems to protect from the feds doing name flooding att=
acks. They already have the software to aid in name flooding attacks, where=
 small teams of agents aim to control many personas online to maximize huma=
n inteligence 'surface area' in pseudonymous networked environments. This=
 is scary. The feds could easily mass register accounts and I am sure that=
 they are doing this. Charging for seller accounts at least puts a price ta=
g on the attack instead of making it essentially free to engage in. However=
, the feds have a lot of money to spend on intelligence sources so this isn=
't perfect protection by any means.<br><br>I think you should go with somew=
hat of a vendor recruitment strategy. You don't need a trust rank system li=
ke OVDB although a decentralized web of trust would be nice. But what I hav=
e been thinking of recently is using a blind signature system to verify the=
 presence of people on a public drug discussion forum prior to some date in=
 time. The logic with this is that public drug discussion forums have very=
 large amounts of registered users with many years of history, and I think=
 that the feds only recently started fucking with persona management softwa=
re and name flooding attacks. The chances that the DEA has a lot of registe=
red nyms on bluelight that registered in 2011 is a lot higher than the prob=
ability that they have a lot of bluelight accounts from 2009, although they=
 probably do have some I don't think they mass registered that early. Some=
 sort of system that can verify a persons account on bluelight while giving=
 them anonymous credentials would be nice.<br><br>The verification can be=
 done automatically by having the user submit the hash of a message they ha=
vn't made yet to the verification server and then giving the verification=
 server the message hash and link it to the thread it will be put into. Sin=
ce only the person with the account will know what they are going to post=
 before they post it, the verification server can verify that they own the=
 account in question. <br><br>Then the server can issue them a blind signat=
ure certificate that can be redeemed for a 'verified' credential on SR. Onl=
y allow people who were on public drug forums from some point in time a pri=
or to get verified status. Now a verified user can prove that they were a=
 member on a public drug discussion forum at some point in time, but they=
 will still have a large crowd size to blend into, particularly if enough=
 people use the system. This means their verified name wont be linkable to=
 their name on the public drug discussion forum. The main reason you want=
 to use blind signatures like this to create unlinkability and a large crow=
d size is to protect from having IP address records from public forums used=
 to deanonymize users. If this were done, verified users would be in the cr=
owd of everyone who obtained a blind signature (to the verification server)=
 or the crowd of all public drug forum users (to any other potential attack=
er).<br><br>Of course being verified status would narrow you down to someon=
e on one of the forums that can get verified status in this way, but people=
 on those forums are already probably targets already, talking about illega=
l drug use openly I hope they all use Tor but I doubt it. If they all used=
 Tor all the time when using bluelight it would be much easier to recruit=
 and give them verified status lol. Not just bluelight though but also foru=
ms like drugs-forum uk etc. Really you could even verify people had nyms on=
 other popular forums in the same way, to increase potential crowd size sub=
stantially and probably protect even more from nym flooding attacks (after=
 all I bet DEA has more nyms on bluelight than they do on some random popul=
ar forum, on the other hand I bet more silk road users have accounts on blu=
elight than any other forum too so it goes both ways).<br><br>I think prote=
cting from human intelligence name flooding attacks in as many ways as poss=
ible is the most important thing that needs to be focused on right now, we=
 are on the verge of making huge progess in the communications / computer=
 security / product transfer - interception detection / financial anonymity=
 etc departments but the one place we are always going to be weak is human=
 intelligence. And human intelligence has a lot of potential to do a lot of=
 damage because once an infiltration or compromise takes place ALL of the=
 nodes networked to the malicious one via the postal system that get packag=
es from it are at serious risk of being compromised, and in the mid-distant=
 future this is going to be the only way the feds have to keep intelligence=
 flows on the scene going (especially once undetected interceptions are a=
 thing of the past).=20

				This is going to hurt the vendors and buyers who mostly deal in smaller=

				Bitcoins suck (volatile exchange rate, takes too long to get them, etc)=

 unprotected, but in the long both seller and buyer benefit (as neither has=

 transactions both as an incentive and giving the customer more bang for hi=

				SR becomes greedy and starts to act like a little chief, here it comes!=
 Your demagogic version of the changes smell fishy to me but you might work=
 hard so you might deserve a little too even if you are now able to transfo=
rm this little into a big one, a big juicy profit! You better save the most=
 you can coz you might need it all one of these days.. perhaps to buy back=
 your freedom... The revolution you are talking abt smells fishy too as the=
re is actually some war going on under your own roof you are not caring abt=
, legit vendors are being attacked by trolls and other envious cunts, some=
 other vendors and buyers alike are continuing their exaction totally unpun=
ished and you SR admin you are still ignoring it. You should clean your doo=
r footstep before trying to put us asleep with your soporific shit and your=
 arbitrary way, I knew you partial once and i still remember it. What about=
 making SR less accessible to the "pecus vulgus", to make it more difficult=
 to register as both vendor and buyer for SR vendors and buyers own good an=
d benefit to keep away the crooks and other shit alike that can only contam=
inate and spoil it all for bad.... What abt taking action against those who=
 are perpetrating shit scams here atm under your SR nose, don't you read al=
l the interesting threads reporting on them, bringing them to the light of=
 shame unveiling their petty tricks, vendors and buyers alike. It is time,=
 definitely, for some cleansing before more legit vendors and buyers who ar=
e tired to be ill-treated decide to retire from the arena coz you are going=
 to end up making money on real dirty money, what an achievement..!!! I amp=
lify it obviously but there is such a lack of true Spirit atm on SR, i wish=
 you can implement some new rules to facilitate=C2=A0 the good work of the=
 good vendors, to protect them as much as they deserve it to make sure they=
 will remain within SR ranks and not at the contrary to be constraint to qu=
it as it is already the case. <br>I had such a great impression of SR when=
 I first came, i gotta confess that the only positive aspect that remains=
 in my mind now is only about the very good people I came across...of a ver=
y small community which makes a H of a difference.<br>With much respect to=
 the true Spirits of this small community and to all the vendors of the oth=
er communities, I wish you to stand up for your rights and to fight to get=
 the best of it because without you SR would worth shit.. sorry I would hav=
e stayed if only the Spirit was true...<br><br>=C2=A0 . n . <br>=C2=A0=20

				Those percentages seem greedy to me. I realize it costs money to mainta=
in the server and site, and on top of that SR should get paid for taking th=
e (relatively small) risk of doing this but even with a flat 3% fee across=
 the board he would be making bank. <br><br>Tens if not hundreds of transac=
tions happen daily, even if he was only making $0.60 per transaction (a $20=
 purchase) with 100 transactions a day would equate to $60 a day, or $1800=
 in a 30 day month. That's a pretty big check for just maintaining the site=
. I may be overestimating the average purchase price or the amount of daily=
 purchases and SR can dispute this, but I feel that I'm not too far off.

				I'm worried about this. I live in a peripheral country with a slow post=
al service. Early finalizing and out-of-escrow (with trusted vendors only,=
 of course) are practically a necessity for people in my situation due to=
 the delay in receiving the products. After all, it's not fair to the vendo=
r to keep the money locked in escrow for the better part of two months just=
 because my country has a shitty postal service. Also, this gives the buyer=
 too much power without balancing it out for the vendors; which will cause=
 vendors to be extremely weary of new buyers, and generally avoid them. Bes=

 I hadn't even considered such a thing five months ago is really still mind=
 blowing. Fans of mind altering substances across the globe can utilize tec=
hnology to easily network with like minded individuals anonymously and seem=
ingly bypass police force by governments who are overstepping their boundar=

 more vendors say fuck it, since it has become less profitable to use SR du=

Bullshit. There are numerous products and services where businesses compete=

 be made and might be able to do things better right away.<br><br>That said=
, if I can buy the same product, from the same vendor, with the same 'safet=

ve a critical mass on that site which could end SR (if they don't find a wa=
y to compete). What that reason can be, can be numerous: it can be the high=
 fees, or maybe the downtimes this site has (but probably a combination of=
 a lot of reasons).

				For drugs online, I think SR is currently your best bet (although I'm=
 seeing BlackMarket building almost the same site - could be a big competit=
or). But remember, this market has just opened for the masses (before, most=
 people didn't buy or bought of street dealers, I guess).<br><br>Now if you=
 take regular electronics, you might go to only Ebay or Amazon. But I think=
 many others compare at other shops. Where I'm from (the Netherlands) those=
 sites aren't that big, and I buy my electronics at a huge range of webshop=
s (which I get from a price comparison site). Low price + good reviews (or=
 other form of trust) =3D sell.<br><br>Same would go for this market (onlin=
e drugs). If I get a better deal at BlackMarket, trust both the seller as=
 the site it self, I'll just buy there instead of here at SR. This isn't th=
e deal (yet), so most will stick around here. But my guess is that more of=
 these sites will pop up, disappear and maybe take over the market position=
 of SR.<br><br>Remember, technically this isn't really an interesting enter=
prise. Your average web developer could set this up in a week or so. The ch=
allenge is in building trust (between all parties involved: SR, sellers, bu=
yers) and making sure you don't get caught. The last bit probably takes som=
e experience from similar, less legit businesses and is the thing holding=
 me back getting into this business as well.

*************<br><br><br>=C2=A0 I have considered all that you have written=
, it has clearly been the result of much consideration.=C2=A0 Here's <br>my=
 concerns:<br><br><br>- -------------------------<br>=C2=A0 "First we must=
 deal with trading out of escrow.=C2=A0 Up to this point we have charged a=
 flat 6.23% <br>commission on all trades.=C2=A0 This is much too high for=
 transactions in the $300 and over range, making <br>trading out of escrow=
 for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system=
.=C2=A0 Now, <br>instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a hi=
gher amount for low priced items and a lower <br>amount for high priced ite=
ms, similar to how eBay does it."<br>- ------------------------<br><br>=C2=
=A0 Well, first off let me say this is *NOT* Ebay.=C2=A0 Ebay sellers get=
 their money *BEFORE* they ship *ANYTHING* out.=C2=A0 <br>So if its gonna=
 be like ebay, then let me have my money upfront.=C2=A0 Ebay bills at the=
 end of the month for their<br>percentage.=C2=A0 Instead of being paid befo=
re I ship things out, Silk Road gets the money and the benefit of the <br>i=
nterest as well as the fluctuation of the BTC market.=C2=A0 Also, I cannot=
 feedback to buyers feedback like on ebay, <br>and buyers do not have a per=
centage rating that is displayed with their usernames either.=C2=A0 This ma=
kes scamming <br>me quite a bit easier.=C2=A0 Furthermore, the listings are=
 not auctions, I have to name my price instead of<br>allowing the market to=
 bear what it will as with ebay, so lets just be clear that this is not eba=
y and you cannot<br>parallel it to ebay.=C2=A0 Now if you wanna make the ch=
anges to make it like ebay, then sure, lets copy ebays system,<br>I'm 110%=
 all in for getting paid upfront before I send out products.<br><br>to sum=
 it up:<br>=C2=A0<br>=C2=A0 1)=C2=A0 Ebay sellers get paid BEFORE they ship=
 goods or services to the buyer.<br>=C2=A0 2)=C2=A0 Ebay sellers get billed=
 at the end of the month for sales percentage due.<br>=C2=A0 3)=C2=A0 Ebay=
 sellers get to post feedback to BUYERS accounts and buyers are rated besid=
e their usernames<br>=C2=A0 4)=C2=A0 Ebay sellers get the benefit of auctio=
n type of prices resulting from current market demand<br><br><br><br>- ----=
--------------------<br>"We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers=
 to see what they thought an appropriate commission <br>schedule would look=
 like.=C2=A0 The average response looked like this:<br>15% of the first $10=

 option for non-escrow purchases into the SR system. Provide it as an alter=

				I couldn't agree more! Here the major problem to a new small time vendo=

 a large quantity of product (and I don't) then I will ALWAYS be sold out,=

 in bulk to HOPEFULLY not be sold out between shipments. This is with rough=
ly $800 down in the beginning. If I see profits from this it will be 8-12=
 months from the time I put my original money in and started this whole gam=

 good for reputation. I literally do not have the money to handle a single=

 what it costs to run a site such as this I've worked IRL doing exactly the=

 would grow this fast, lets see if we can squeeze a few more % out of peopl=

 occur in such a short time and in order to maintain the site and perform=
 some upgrades (maybe even some examples would be nice) we need to re-asses=
 the fee structure to accomodate this. Additionally the amount of work it=

 But this is not the message not at all. <br><br>If the interest was truly=
 in how to reduce scamming and taking a community oriented approach to this=
 (as you indicated that you discussed this with people, although seeing as=
 how the top vendors that have posted here knew nothing about it) it would=
 have been discussed WITH THE COMMUNITY. Show me one single thread where th=

 outlined them and then if it was really about 'the community' let them dec=

n-win but thats not what is happening.<br><br>I really truly think SR is a=
 great site, and I really hope to see it survive a long and healthy life bu=
t if you want people to believe in it as much as you claim then things like=
 this should be discussed openly at least to some extent with the community=

				I've already noticed a huge spike in price for smaller items. And I thi=
nk SR themselves recommend doing smaller transactions, so if you get ripped=
,or it doesn't show, you're not out tons of $$. Seriously,is anyone paying=
 $70usd for an 1/8 of herb?=C2=A0 I hope this catches on IRL! Not the fees,=
 but the prices! It'll go from care giving to actually making some $$!!=C2=
=A0 <br>MrGrey is right in saying this hurts the little guy, both buyer and=
 seller. Hurts em bad. <br>We must also look at this from another view: The=
 police call most drugs "controlled substances", as they control them(espec=
ially in my area)...make no qualms about it. So, they make the price by kee=
ping the demand for supply up. If I'm wrong, please tell me the lone sole=
 individual who creates the prices of drugs,as most are in no way correlate=
d to the cost to manufacture them. I bring this up, because isn't SR doing=
 the same thing? SR is creating prices that just go up and up and up. How=
 long will keep buying items at a 20-40% markup, just for the novelty or "s=
afety" of getting them online? How safe is it when you take 1/8,which is a=
 minor crime in most countries, but put it in the mail, and instant felony.=
 <br>Don't wanna get your noid gland salivating, but how many vendors could=
 be NUCLEO? And to me, this stands for Narcotics Undercover Law Enforcement=
 Officer, so even seeing a vendor with this antonym is sketchy as fuck. Is=
 that supposed to be funny? Anyway, how many have purchased, never received=
, got your 50% refund, and felt all was OK? Or even worse, got your product=
, but it wasn't as stated (MHM &amp; TT), I bring this up just to point out=
 that we may be paying very high prices, just to give ourselves up. <br>IRL=
 I can get most of what's offered on the road, but much cheaper, and I feel=
 much safer, as I am lucky enough to deal with people I have known since gr=
ade school (I know this option isn't there for everyone, but we choose wher=
e we live ans who we associate with, it wasn't me who put you in a city ful=
l of thugs and murderers.) My 1st thoughts of SR were that I could find som=
e killer deals,since they had a world market. But those thoughts were quick=
ly stifled. <br>I know I went off topic, but I think it coalesces with pric=
e increase. <br>Then there's the other spectrum. It is already difficult to=
 become a vendor,unless you're a computer genius, so there is a lot of time=
 (time=3D$$) and $$ invested in becoming a vendor....a safe one, anyway. $1=
50 for the account, a vac sealer, plastic, stamps, etc, etc, etc, so yeah,=
 most have ALREADY raised their price to compensate, not thinking long term=
 at all. If you're selling 1oz/wk IRL, and 10oz/wk on SR, then you've alrea=
dy been compensated. Bulk is supposed to be cheaper. <br>I also think anyon=
e who claims they just want to be able to spread the love(drugs) to all us=
 who want it is full of shit. If that were the case, it'd be FREE. <br>The=
 more posts I read, the more I think this may be a bad idea. $150 for an ac=
count, there's $36,000usd right there. BTW, that's my salary,too! What a co=
incidence. Then, of those sellers, he takes what percent? 6.25% of sales,=
 plus the hedging fee? So, basically 10% of every sale. Yeah, I'd say WELL=
 over $5K/mo,though I don't have those figures to compare. But from the for=
ums to the feedback, I'd say maybe $5K/day is closer to it. Any of those fu=
nds being funneled to NORML, or MAPS?? I doubt it. Very much so.=C2=A0 <br>=
And if SR had lengthy discussions with top rated vendors prior to this deci=
sion, and that those same vendors felt it was a fair schedule, then WHY are=
 top rated vendors coming to this thread to complain? <br>Just my morning=
 un-thoughts after sleeping on it,an seeing more posts.

 right to do what it pleases. If you don't like it, then create//find your=

 become too large of a problem for out-of-escrow transactions to continue.=

lled on this one but I'm going to try to speak out for all those vendors wh=
o do finalize early (so please no attacking) :P<br><br>We've got to separat=
e between finalizing early and excellence in customer service, I have perso=
nally created a risk profile where I believe that it's ok to ask a customer=
 to finalize early (in no way do I believe it's a scam as I state this clea=
rly and the customer agrees to these conditions).<br><br>Now, the customers=
 must look to what finalize early means for them, in my case even if they=
 finalize early they are still covered (hence the reason why I have 100% po=
sitive feedback). If a package doesn't arrive then I resend, + another very=
 important point is to be 100% at the buyers disposal for questions, etc.<b=
r><br>In effect for a customer to purchase from me, finalizing early is no=
 different but on my side a I guarantee myself that I'm not going to get an=
y newbie mistakes such as not finalizing at all. It takes time to learn abo=
ut how this world works and vendors shouldn't have their capital tied in pe=
ople learning how it works.<br><br>The reason the finalizing early model ca=
n be sustained is because the buyers have the power to change feedback afte=
r the transaction has been made, therefore if a vendor is scamming people=
 by finalizing early it will soon be seen in his ratings (remember the Turk=
ish guy selling heroin, for example). This is the model used by sites like=
 ebay.<br><br>I hope I don't get grilled on this one.<br><br>What is import=
ant is not the finalize early option but the customer service given to the=
 buyer.<br><br>Work hard for the buyer and he will compensate you by coming=
 back. <br><br>or that's the theory, lol<br><br>fly<br><br><br><br>

=C2=A0 It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challe=

 over tyranny.=C2=A0 We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and pr=

 more participants means more prosperity.=C2=A0 What we've found in practic=
e is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal sh=
ort-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.<br><br>So, we've had two=
 major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.=C2=A0 One is maki=
ng our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cybe=
r-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose=
 to start that war.=C2=A0 This is always and ever a top priority.=C2=A0 The=
 other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy=
 and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun=
 toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped of=
f by their trading partner.<br><br>I am proud to say we have been successfu=
l in achieving these goals up to this point.=C2=A0 The site remains up and=
 functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full=
 capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poo=
rly executed url switch, just to name a few).=C2=A0 And, over 99% of all tr=
ansactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfac=
tion of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is=
 found.<br><br>This success has in no way made us complacent however.=C2=A0=
 New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scamme=

 we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.=C2=A0 This is much=

 of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within=
 the system.=C2=A0 Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will char=
ge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced=
 items, similar to how eBay does it.<br><br>We've worked hard to come up wi=

				I haven't read this entire thread, but I have been thinking about the=

 eBay<br><br>It's more like a craigslist, it connects sellers with SR and=
 deserves a payment, but it's not a bidding site.<br><br>The more you buy,=
 the bigger the risk<br><br>I have bought $300+ orders before and would hap=
pily do so again, but they didn't arrive. Customs is more likely to take a=
 peak a larger packages. So I order 1 month supply of meds at a time, which=
 are usually sold as packs of ten. So I order 3-6 orders of 10 doses each.=
 If they are all now 15% more, that's passed on to me. I've already seen se=
llers stop selling my meds, and others raise prices 30%. Theoretically, I=
 could buy $300 at once and be better off, but previous experience tells me=
 it's not getting through customs.<br><br>There are other ways to make mone=
y<br><br>Seller registration, escrow services, how about front page adverti=
sing for sellers? Why make me pay for lower, safer quantity which only make=
s me think twice about using SR instead of other sources?<br><br>I'd love=
 to buy bulk and avoid the fee increase, but this isn't Sam's Club/Costco,=
 I can lose $300 worth of meds to customs if I buy in that amount.<br><br>I=
t's bad for sellers too<br><br>I understand "finalizing early" too. It's an=
noying to see so many reviews that don't say whether something arrived or=
 was legit, but sellers can't control customs inspections. They also might=
 not want to sell to someone with low reputation. So who wins here? No one,=
 SR is damaged because we're driven away.<br><br>SR, good while it lasted.

				I might be new here on SR, and want to become a seller, but I'm not new=
 to The Bitcoins, web markets and business.<br><br>The SR apart from the id=
ea it is a business place, and an revenue place for the creators of the SR.=
 And they should earn as much as possible. They had an idea they made it an=
d it should be appreciated by all users. This business have to grow =3D gro=
wing means more money it creates. And it should stay that way.<br>From what=
 I can see now there is a problem (not a big of a deal but still) with some=
 dishonest traders, either buyers or sellers, and Bitcoin fluctuation (but=
 lets assume, that this fluctuations are sometimes pros, sometimes cons, de=
pend on an individual opinion)<br><br>I only have a suggestion as a new use=
r who wants to become a seller, and if this suggestion is already implement=
ed that I'm sorry don't mind my post at all.<br>To grow, SR needs more sell=
ers and buyers, with more "legal and illegal" goods. The idea of purchasing=
 an seller account is very good, it prevents more dishonest traders to appe=
ar. But for new sellers that really want to be honest it is quite a lot of=
 cash, and as am I, this comes with worries about buyers.<br>My idea about=
 reading this forum is quite simple.<br>For new buyers escrow is obligatory=
 (it seems that it would be in a short while for all) but they cannot "fina=
lize early" - but could they list an item with a condition that only buyers=
 with XXX ratings can buy from him? That way one can be a bit more secure,=
 it will prevent from random orders and giving a bad feedback. This will pr=
event scamming by seller and buyers.<br>After the seller become trusty, he=
 can than choose to not to sell to new users (but probably will not), and=
 make an option for users to finalize it early. This finalizing early thing=
 is good too. The bitcoins are still processed through the escrow system so=
 the commission is charged to SR. And established seller can help grow the=
 SR by accepting new buyers w/o a risk of being scammed by them. Let's face=
 it. No one would want to be scammed either seller, buyers, and especially=
 SR.<br>I cannot tell about the commission is it high or moderate or low -=
 i don't think about that. But to be honest it probably will be added to fi=
nal price for buyers.<br><br>In other simple words, SR needs to evolve, by=
 making more buyers, sellers and especially money, but it has to be more fr=
iendly too. So basic suggestion is simple limitations for new buyers and se=
llers to prevent scammers.=C2=A0 <br><br>SR is a good idea for The Bitcoins=
, one has to pay some money to become seller that is why customers might th=
ink that the seller is legit, but what about new buyers? Seller has to be=
 protected too. But there is no simple solution for all these problems. As=
 many ppl there are there would be as many opinion on that matter. <br><br>=
I really hope that SR will grow more, and more. <br><br><br>Maybe all these=
 things is not a big of a deal - let say 1% of all users are scammers,? tha=
n my post is pointless. But after the growth of SR more seller and buyers=
 will come and than it could become a problem.<br><br>Regards
