				I have no faith in the election process. And what you say about the med=
ia and public support being suppressed is absolutely valid and cannot be de=
nied by any observant person. The public is being railroaded, have been for=
 many years, but it's about to come to a head.=C2=A0 In less than a decade=
 this system will change or the government will be forced to detain and/or=
 kill a huge number of "insurgents". There comes a time when you have nothi=

				It seems like a bit of a leap to assume that he got busted for sure. Bu=

				Has your friend made any other purchases at all on the site? Even befor=

 Also, if Tony was busted, we would have heard something by now right? A hu=

				I was just wondering.=C2=A0 A conservative estimate of the number of pe=
ople who ordered from Tony over the week or so before the sale and the few=
 days after the sale is probably around 70-100.=C2=A0 As far as I know not=
 one of those people has said they received anything.<br><br>Yet, your IRL=
 buddy, out of all those people, received his 3g's to his drop?=C2=A0 And=
 LE came calling?<br><br>And if the stuff didn't come to his drop, it was=
 just LE with his address investigating him, where did they get the address=
 from, and why would they even be bothering him if nothing came?=C2=A0 Some=
one gave them the address and they just decided to knock on his door to see=
 if they could shake the person up?=C2=A0 What would be the point if they=
 didn't have anything to hold against him/her?=C2=A0 And if they did have=
 the product, I would think they would have taken him/her downtown, not jus=
t talked to them.=C2=A0 It's one thing for something to be delivered to som=
eones home mailbox, it is much easier to deny.=C2=A0 Something coming to a=
 PO box, correctly addressed, tends to show intent. <br><br>If Tony did get=
 popped, then he got popped by his own country's LE.=C2=A0 They would be th=
e ones with all the addresses.=C2=A0 That would mean they had to have sent=
 the address to other LE.=C2=A0 If that was the case we would be hearing fr=
om all sorts of people, yet again, out of 70-100 (at least) buyers we haven=
't heard of anyone getting product and we haven't heard of anyone having th=
eir doors knocked on.<br><br>All these threads with more and more complicat=
ed theories amazes me.=C2=A0 If he got popped or sick or simply took a vaca=
tion, then we would still expect a percentage of those people who ordered=
 BEFORE the sale getting their product, yet as far as I can tell from all=
 the threads and polls, nobody has.=C2=A0 These items would have been in th=
e mail and at least some of them would have arrived before he left, however=
 that was.=C2=A0 LE would not have been able to intercept them in time as=
 far as I can see, some would have gotten through.<br><br>The old saying,=
 "The simplest answer is usually the correct one", seems to me to be the mo=
st plausible.<br><br>From every indication Tony was setting everything up=
 for this a couple of weeks in advance.=C2=A0 He refused to send via expres=
s or priority or any type of tracked shipment, so it would take longer befo=
re people could say their package wasn't coming.=C2=A0 He asked for FE from=
 basically everybody, he opened up international. He then told everyone he=
 was going offline to get caught up, further obscuring things. <br><br>The=
 simplest answer would seem to be he just completed one of the biggest scam=
s on SR and is relaxing seaside with a Margarita with 60-100k of everybody'=
s money.<br><br>I would love to be wrong.=C2=A0 I would love to open my mai=
l and find a letter from Tony.=C2=A0 But I'm not holding my breath waiting=
 for it.<br><br>I'm not saying that everything didn't happen exactly as you=
r buddy says, but are you sure there couldn't be some other reason they wer=
e bothering him/her?=C2=A0 They never ordered anything else from anyone els=
e?<br><br>Again, this is just my opinion, don't take it personally, I'm jus=
t thinking out loud here.

blicly freaking out over shit they have zero control over.<br><br>If you're=
 ordering drugs from the Internet, you need to habituate yourself to the po=
ssibility that at some point you might encounter LEO. This means adopting=
 behavior that severely reduces the likelihood that a government agent will=
 find a reason to cuff your ass. Some of this behavior may make it slightly=
 inconvenient to freely use your drugs, but I'd rather be inconvenienced by=
 hiding my stash that takes 5 minutes to reach than be inconvenienced by a=
 charge of possession or intent to distribute. Dealing with either of those=
 is definitely more than 5 minutes.<br><br>So, until someone has a mug shot=
, a crime scene photo with a corpse, copy of an indictment, etc. I'm going=
 with the simplest explanation: Tony went AWOL. Maybe he pulled a legendary=
 con. Maybe he stiffed his supplier and got his ass killed. Maybe he discov=
ered that having to rapidly scale an illegal trafficking business was more=
 than he could handle so he said "Fuck it". I'd rather lose $1000 to a con=
 man than use it to post bail or retain a lawyer. It's also why you shouldn=
't gamble more than you can afford to lose. The odds of scoring here are st=
ill better than winning big at a casino.<br><br>To summarize, unless your=
 use of the verb "know" falls into one of the above two categories, don't=
 fucking use it. And stop fucking moaning about how Tony done broke-ded all=
 your hearts and wallets. Rolling in the muck is never the best way to get=
 clean.

				I remember a major case in the Netherlands, called the IRT case. It was=
 reviewed by a parliamentary commission because the tactics that were not=
 heard of before. The police went undercover and infiltraded the drugmarket=
. They imported 100.000s of kilo's foreign weed and some 15.000 kilo of coc=
aine. At least that's what public. They would offer it here in NL in big qu=
antities in an attempt to map part of the bigger players in those markets.=
 <br>The outcome of the parliamentary commission was that in the future ope=
rations like this should have approval in advance from a judge, that should=
 not be initialized by police itself.=20
