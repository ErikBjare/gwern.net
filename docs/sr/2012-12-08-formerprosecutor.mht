				<br><br>The object of the war on drugs is not to eradicate drugs, it's=
 to mitigate consumption, i think.<br>Would you want the whole country able=
 to buy heron at a convenience store?<br>If you want to get into a philosop=
hical debate, sure, I am all for free markets and libertarian politics. In=
 a utopian world, drugs should be legal, but that's not how it works here=
 so oh well.<br>Your job as a legal professional is to have no personal att=
achment to the cases. I guess that's impossible though. I always get a laug=
h when prosecutors think they're "going after bad guys. Its not the people=
 its the institution!!!=C2=A0 Ok sorry to ramble, im a bit stoned :P<br>[/q=
uote]<br><br>Of course it is only going to mitigate consumption.=C2=A0 No,=
 I don't think you should be able to buy hard drugs at a convenience store.=
=C2=A0 However, I also don't think you should go to prison for 60 years for=
 selling 1 gram of cocaine either.<br><br>I don't have a personal attachmen=
t to 99% of my cases.=C2=A0 I know most of the time I'm not going after "ba=
d guys."=C2=A0 However, there are some very bad guys I have gone after and=
 I'm proud of that.

ver saw a case referred for prosecution that was less than a pound for mari=
juana or 2 ounces for cocaine.=C2=A0 Definitely not saying you are safe if=
 you order less, but most offices don't have time to mess with small time=
 buyers.<br><br>On another note, what I find interesting about this place=
 is how the risk is totally the opposite of how it normally is.=C2=A0 Most=
 of the time, we were only interested in dealers.=C2=A0 The only time users=
 were arrested was when they were caught by uniform officers, usually durin=
g traffic stops.=C2=A0 Seems to me that the easiest way to get busted here=
 is when you are the buyer.=C2=A0 Most of the time when undercover cops bus=
t the buyers it is because they want to get to the dealer.=C2=A0 Obviously,=
 there is no way a buyer on SR knows who the seller is.<br><br>One piece of=
 advice I can give everyone is to never NEVER talk to the cops if you get=
 busted.=C2=A0 They will act like they are your friend and they will tell=
 you it will be better if you talk.=C2=A0 Sometimes you can get a better de=
al if you talk, but don't think for an instant that you have to talk right=
 away.=C2=A0 You can always ask for a lawyer.=C2=A0 If you do have good inf=
o, then the cops can wait.=C2=A0 If people didn't talk, we would have solve=

				HJ,<br><br>What advice can you give to resellers here on SR. People who=
 buy product on SR to resell that same product here on the road. <br><br>It=
 seems, given what you've said so far, the main weakness is having the prod=
uct shipped to you and if you're getting large quantities there is the pote=
ntial for large issues. What precautions can be taken?<br><br>I think what=
 typically happens is the reseller would setup a virtual office to have the=
 mail delivered to that is either in his name, another persons name, or the=
 name of a company setup for this purpose. <br><br>Do any of these options=
 provide more or less protection than the other options providing said pers=

vide any protection since the reseller could potentially claim this other=
 person ordered it?<br><br>What would proper proceedure be? Does wirtting=
 "return to sender" on the package and not opening it for a few days provid=

				Hi HJ<br>Let's say someone from an European country sends a very small=
 amount of a controlled substance like lsd to the US. The letter gets inter=
cepted and police finds a fingerprint (from the sender). Will they run a ch=
eck on fingerprints in their database? If so, are these fingerprints only=
 from people who have already committed a crime or do they have the possibi=
lity to run a check on fingerprints of everyone who ever has entered the co=
untry?<br>Many thanks.

				OP, thank you for taking the time to answer questions and offer advice.=
=C2=A0 This whole experiment in unregulated commerce is still pretty new,=
 and the risk is not 100% clear, so the perspective of insiders who know th=
e game is invaluable.=C2=A0 A few people like yourself have stopped by, and=
 eventually get driven off by a barrage of inane questions and/or rude comm=
ents.=C2=A0 <br><br>I understand not everyone working in law enforcement is=
 an evil anti-drug zealot; there's good laws and bad laws, and good cops an=
d assholes just like every other group.=C2=A0 However, nobody in that busin=
ess gets to choose which laws they like to enforce. Blame the politicians.=
 (I do have a problem with the DEA and some of their their dirty pool tacti=
cs: abuse of forfeiture laws, inflating charges, and constant reliance on=
 snitches who will say anything to stay out of jail, etc., but I guess that=
's how the game is played)=C2=A0 <br><br>I just have a few questions of my=
 own, which reading this thread again I notice you have partly answered alr=
eady, so feel free to focus on anything interesting:<br><br>Would intercept=
ing a package containing small amounts of scheduled drugs that are addresse=
d to the occupant of a residence be enough evidence to charge someone if th=
e occupant refused to answer questions and the sender was unknown? <br><br>=
Let's consider the same scenario, but a larger quantity of Schedule I is in=
tercepted, the DEA gets involved, and a search warrant is obtained.=C2=A0=
 Upon executing the search, the package is found unopened. No other contrab=
and is found, but a computer is seized; however, the hard drive is encrypte=
d.=C2=A0 Could the occupant be compelled to reveal the passphrase by a judg=
e in these circumstances, or could the accused plead the fifth? Would this=
 be enough evidence to charge/indite in your opinion? How hard would it be=
 to obtain a conviction under these circumstances? (I noticed you raised th=
e possibility of long term surveillance for large amounts, that's a more co=
mplex scenario I guess.)<br><br>Just speculating, I know the US government=
 has been studying SR for some time, what do you think might be their next=
 move, assuming they don't defeat the cryptography side of things?=C2=A0 A=
 sting operation on buyers to scare and set an example maybe, like prostitu=
tion stings?=C2=A0 Like you said, they usually care more about the dealers,=
 but these appear to be the harder target, like you said.=C2=A0 Money trail=
 maybe?=C2=A0 I fully expect some legislative attempt to regulate cryptocur=
rency will occur eventually...<br><br>Finally just for fun, is that HBO sho=
w The Wire an accurate portrayal of the drug war during that time period (e=
arly 2000s) ?=C2=A0 I just love that series, I think it is one of the few=
 shows that attempts to show both sides.<br><br>Also, thanks to those who=
 ask good questions, this is a really valuable and interesting thread.<br>

				thats another question HJAnslinger. how often did you see case where no=
body had talked and what was the likelyhood of prosecuting a case like this=
? of course i understand other strong evidence could completely void utter=
 silence however you did mention the majority of the time your cases were=
 based on somebody talking so i was wondering did anyone you prosecute ever=
 get off because they/everyone kept their mouth shut? also how high was you=
r conviction rate as a prosecutor? I understand if you dont wanna give exac=
t numbers but is it 50/50 or something like 90/10 in the prosecutions favou=
r?=20

 hard drive is encrypted.=C2=A0 Could the occupant be compelled to reveal=
 the passphrase by a judge in these circumstances, or could the accused ple=

				Hi HJAnslinger,<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to answer our questio=
ns here. I have a couple about jurisdiction and interception process.<br><b=
r>If USPS in one state intercepts a SR package heading to another state, an=
d the drug found is marijuana (personal amount weight; less than oz), what=
 state's LE agency would be involved in deciding whether to pursue this mat=
ter?=C2=A0 =C2=A0Would the authorities from the state in which the package=
 was intercepted contact the receiving state's authorities to let them deci=
de whether they will pursue?=C2=A0 Or will this be up to the discretion of=
 the federal authorities?=C2=A0 I mean since it's a federal crime to use th=
e postal service to move drugs, would the feds be involved in deciding what=
 to do and would be less inclined to pursue a case with just personal amoun=
t weight?<br><br>Secondly, do you know how long is the process, once drugs=
 have been detected by USPS, to get a warrant and to actually inspect the=
 package?=C2=A0 If I receive my package in 3-5 days (which is expected deli=
very time coast to coast), is it nearly impossible that USPS and the author=
ities had the time to get a warrant, inspect and perform a controlled deliv=
ery?=C2=A0 Assuming, of course, that I wasn't previously on their radar and=
 the package/I was a new occurrence to them.<br><br>Thanks, again.<br><br>E=
DIT:<br><br>I have a third question concerning civil forfeiture laws.=C2=A0=
 I know the application of this varies from state to state but how likely=
 would it be for authorities to seize your home if you're receiving marijua=
na in personal amounts?=C2=A0 Would that make it more worthwhile for federa=
l prosecutors to pursue a case?=C2=A0 Or even for local prosecutors. too?

				It's really awesome that you're doing this dude. I'm always happy to se=
e recognize their wrongs and turn over a new leaf.<br><br>1) Let's say poli=
ce bust down my door and say they have intercepted a package carrying drugs=
 and addressed to me. Let's say the confiscate my laptop and see that I hav=
e Tor, not to mention a history of visiting the URL for the Silk Road. Can=
 they require me to provide a username and password? If they can't, would=
 this evidence alone be enough to convict me? I doubt it but I'd rather be=
 sure. This is why I keep my house drug-free, the police will find nothing=
 here.<br><br>2) I'm curious if you happen to know how many drug dealers we=
re caught due to a financial mistake rather than a drug-dealing related mis=
take. For example, was anyone prosecuted because the IRS noticed they were=
 making income that shouldn't exist? How much income would one have to make=
 from drug dealing before the government took notice? Like if I were unempl=
oyed except for drug dealing, and also I rent an apartment with a few frien=
ds, would anyone come knocking eventually? I don't know if you'll know this=
, but figured I should ask.<br><br>Cheers.

me in here- I've been forced to deal with LE on a few seperate occasions...=
 the first one, my home was raided, someone dressed in a FEDEX uniform came=
 to my door, asked for me, and then a bunch of LE jumped out of a FEDEX van=
 and forced their way into the home with weapons drawn.=C2=A0 I wasn't ther=
e... sucked for my room mate.=C2=A0 LE had a warrant and had been casing th=
e place for some time.=C2=A0 A few things I learned from that experience ar=
e: <br><br>1. LE need to describe your home in great detail when asking for=
 a warrant... there will be someone scoping out your place and writing thin=
gs down like color, where doors are, license plates of cars parked outside,=
 etc, a good deal of time before the warrant is ever approved or served. <b=
r><br>2. Warrants have expiration dates and can only be executed during cer=
tain hours...=C2=A0 apparently it takes more work to have a warrant approve=
d for execution in the middle of the night than for execution during normal=
 hours.=C2=A0 I'm pretty sure LE won't execute a search warrant without spe=
cial evidence in the wee hours of the morning<br><br>In the other experienc=
es, I've learned that LE will arrest you even if they don't have appropriat=
e evidence.=C2=A0 If there was contraband in a package delivered to my home=
 and LE knew about it they would find some way to arrest me.=C2=A0 If there=
 was a "controlled delivery" being executed on my residence, I highly doubt=
 that the LE would decide that they couldn't arrest me because my I wouldn'=
t sign for the package.=C2=A0 It's LE's job to get you into the back of a=
 car, not to make the charges stick.=C2=A0 That's the prosecutors job.=C2=
=A0 =C2=A0 <br><br>One time I had LE knock on my door because a friend was=
 caught with a DUI leaving my place.=C2=A0 LE asked me to step outside so=
 we could talk, and as soon as I stepped foot outside they slapped cuffs on=
 me for being under the influence.=C2=A0 Now I've learned never to answer=
 the door when LE knocks.. you are not required to answer the door for ANYO=
NE, even LE.=C2=A0 If I do answer the door, I will simply state that everyt=
hing is OK here, I didn't call LE, they cannot come in, I will not step out=
side, thanks, goodbye.<br><br>Most possesion of personal use amounts end up=
 with a defferred entry of judgement, probation, and mandated treatment pro=
grams.=C2=A0 Even repeat offenders=C2=A0 =C2=A0<br><br><br>Maybe the OP can=
 validate some of my statements<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter">=

 everything else 70%<br><br>=C2=A0what loopholes are there where could the=

 or not.<br><br>But I would assume hiding who the money Goes to would be a=
 good start if they can't prove that the employees and the manager did not=

 be good for them in court if they even went to court.<br><br>=C2=A0and as=
 for the district manager he has an overseas account also all of his Americ=
