				I believe I am a victim of this aswell, something shady is going on. <b=
r><br>Ordered some MDMA in their sale two fridays ago. I've made 2 successf=
ul orders from them before, but this time they required I FE due to a sligh=
t (small) refund rate, so I did that.<br><br>Order was marked in transit la=
st Monday. Didn't arrive by Wednesday or Thursday so I contacted ETM. They=
 gave me a 100% guarantee it would be there by Friday and that if it wasn't=
 they would give 100% refund. <br><br>Come Friday, it still hadn't arrived.=
 I contacted ETM again Friday afternoon, but still haven't gotten any reply=
 despite repeated attempts to contact them.<br><br>What the hell is going=
 on? I have no choice but to leave them very bad feedback for lack of arriv=
al, poor communication and broken promises.<br><br>I thought ETM was very=
 trustworthy from my first couple of orders, but this has really changed my=
 mind.<br><br><br><br>EDIT:<br><br>My stats are as follows - <br><br>Total=
 transactions: 25<br>Total spent: =E0=B8=BF220.71<br>Refund rate: 3.98%<br>=
Auto-finalize rate: 0.43%<br>Member for: 1 year<br><br>ETM required I FE du=
e to the refund rate of 3.98%. I acquired this rate from a single transacti=
on in which the seller was falsely advertising and packaging poorly, and fu=
rthermore the seller was banned at the same time in an incident unrelated=
 to my problem. So I believe I am a very trustworthy buyer, would have perf=
ect stats if it wasn't for that.<br><br>Thanks samesamebutdifferent, I hope=
 they contact me real soon because I'm very frustrated with the situation.

				I doubt it's postal theft, that doesn't explain ETM's sudden lack of co=
mmunication. If it was a case of postage theft, surely ETM would check the=
 express post tracking number and contact me (that's the purpose of the tra=
cking number of course, so that they can be sure whether an item has been=
 delivered or not, to protect themselves against fraudulent buyers).<br><br=

ightning FAST shipping is back with Express Post on EVERY ITEM! Please see=
 our new products and specials!".<br><br>fredflinstone, what do you mean ab=
out him buying his ATM card, could you explain how that relates to this dis=

				To all those who are having the same issue, make sure you leave feedbac=
k (or edit it if you've already posted a 'FE as requested'). Whatever is go=
ing on, we need to get the message out that it is unwise to make any orders=
 from ETM at this point, or more people are gonna get stuck in this situati=
on. I suspect there are many people who have FE'd but haven't seen or poste=
d in this thread yet.

ah I wouldn't be surprised if snoopy is etm trying to throw people off. If=
 you are desperate to track him down your best chance is asking Limetless=

 address he would give it up in a heartbeat, for the right price of course.=
 I doubt that someone like etm would be ordering to an address that could=
