				Product: Sample 2mg xanax bar &amp; 2 ksalol<br><br>Shipping: shipping=
 came quick to me, 2 days from order placed.<br><br>Stealth: Good packaging=
, at first i thought i was fucked over when i saw it, but then when i looke=
d closely it was well hidden lol :)<br><br>Product: I haven't taken it yet=
 but i have taken these exact 2 products before and it's the same high qual=
ity products.<br><br>You are going to kill the market with these prices if=
 you keep them which i hope you do, i can get a xanax bar on the street for=
 $5 and that's how the prices should be. I prefer the 2mg bar so im glad yo=
ur having them at this price. Overall i have high hopes for this vendor, do=
mestic, fair prices, fast shipping &amp; stealthy packaging. Welcome to the=
 market and thanks for the sample :)<br>'

				Thank you Molly Want a Cracker.=C2=A0 When I opened the package I had=
 a good laugh.=C2=A0 The packaging is genius.=C2=A0 I've never had the Serb=
ian ksalol, so I tried one of those first with a glass of wine.=C2=A0 I sta=
rted to feel the relaxing qualities of xanax and then took the other one.=
=C2=A0 After that I woke up in the morning naked with my SO and no memory.=
=C2=A0 In short these are legit pills with a great price and superior shipp=
ing.=C2=A0 I'm going to try the bar today but it looks like the real deal.=
=C2=A0 Thanks Molly.

				Here is my review for Molly's Greenstone G3722 Xanax Bar and the round=
 1mg Ksalol tablets.<br><br>Communication:=C2=A0 Molly was a professional=
 and communication was there. Even messaged me to tell me when it was maile=
d out!=C2=A0 10/10<br><br>Shipping:=C2=A0 So far with the agonizingly slow=
 mail with USPS,=C2=A0 Molly's package arrived faster than any other packag=
es I have been waiting for a bout a week or more!=C2=A0 Took 4 business day=
s for arrival!! 10/10<br><br>Packaging:=C2=A0 Pro Pro Pro.=C2=A0 Nothing su=
spicious about the package at all, looks like something you would get when=
 you order a small item off ebay.=C2=A0 Professionally done with printed la=
bels, DCN, and a very cute way too hide the xannies haha ;) 10/10<br><br>Pr=
oduct it self:=C2=A0 The Greenstone G3722 Xanax bar looks very legit, defin=
itely not a fake.=C2=A0 The 2x 1mg Ksalol "Serbian" Xanax tablets are the=
 one I tested out as soon as I received the package.=C2=A0 I popped 1 of th=
e Ksalol xanax round tablet to gauge it's strength and speed of the onset=
 for the effects.=C2=A0 Placed it in my mouth, and instantly the tablet sta=
rted melting and you can taste that distinct Xanax bitterness with a slight=
 hint of sweetness to it which was pretty cool.=C2=A0 It had that chalky Va=
lium/Klonopin texture when you take it Sublingual.=C2=A0 I must say this ma=
y well be dosed a little higher than 1mg because it certainly kicked in onl=
y after 10 minutes and any anxiety and tension I had sort of melted away wi=
th the subtle kick of euphoria from the tension taken away.=C2=A0 Keep in=
 mind I have a very high benzo tolerance!=C2=A0 About 10-15 minutes later=
 I popped the other Ksalol 1mg tablet and 20 minutes later and I'm feeling=
 good! <br><br>As for the Greenstone Xanax bar, this definitely, not a doub=
t in my mind a legit pressed pill and not a fake.=C2=A0 It is very cleanly=
 pressed and has no signs of rough edges that could've been made by a fake=
 pill press.=C2=A0 I will update once I have tested this out later in the=
 day or when taken tomorrow.<br><br>Picture:<br>http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.oni=
on/view.php?image=3D43f2f0f2983aa9c0b44bc015f20d730f.jpg<br><br>Thank you=
 Molly! Lets do business soon!

				<br>My transaction with Molly was excellent! <br><br>Fast, excellent pr=
oduct, succinct communication and the Ksalol is arguably the best Xanax pro=
duct on the market.=C2=A0 Molly also threw in some G3722's which in my opin=
ion are also about as good as the Ksalol's .=C2=A0 For me the Ksalol are th=
e best, but everyone is different.=C2=A0 I don't think a package not showin=
g up from a new vendor has anything to do with the vendor not sending it.=
 That would not make any sense.=C2=A0 If it's moving slow, the buyer probab=
ly made a type O in the address if the seller copied and pasted the info.=
=C2=A0 That's my opinion.=C2=A0 Keep up the good work Molly!

				I have never written a review before but feel compelled to do so in thi=
s instance simply because MWAC is so responsive, fast, helpful and, most im=
portant, careful. MWAC went out of her way to help me with a listing I had=
 missed and did so very quickly and efficiently. MWAC cares about customers=
 from start to finish. 5 of 5 ratings are so common that they don't seem to=
 carry that much meaning anymore but in this case it really applies as MWAC=
 is absolutely top notch.

				My first order on SR was placed with Molly, after doing all my research=
 I really thought she was going to cancel my order since I had NO history=
 at all. <br><br>BUT... The transaction was perfect- she notified me when=
 she shipped my package and then answered my questions promptly. Ordered on=
 Sunday night- Monday was a holiday- got the goods today, Wednesday. Packag=
ing is great, didn't know what to expect but was totally thrilled at her cr=
eativity. Couldn't have ordered from a better vendor for my first purchase-=
 THANKS!!!

				I'm very sorry about the cancellations, but I'd rather cancel orders in=
 a timely manner and give compensation than leave my customers hanging and=
 wondering what the hell is going on. All outstanding orders, including bea=

 need to get some bullshit straightened out. Thank you for understanding.
