 you work with EnterTheMatrix reselling domesticlly (and hopefully cheaper=
 ie buy bulk 500 tabs for $5000 so $10 a tab then resell them for $15 to $2=
0 a tab) and he has said he also has vial from time to time which would be=
 amazing to be able to get. Anyways, looking forward to your venture turnin=
