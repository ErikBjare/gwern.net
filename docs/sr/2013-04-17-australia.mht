				Read for yourself guys... and stay safe:<br><br>http://www.bordermail.c=
om.au/story/1508217/jail-time-for-web-drug-trafficker/?cs=3D2452<br><br>A=
 man has become the first Illawarra person - and one of only a handful nati=
onwide - to be convicted of trafficking drugs via an underground website.<b=
r><br>Christopher Owen was yesterday jailed for a minimum 5=C2=BD years for=
 selling large amounts of drugs via the Silk Road - an anonymous, online dr=
ug-trading website in which buyers pay for illegal substances using the Bit=
coin virtual currency.<br><br>Wollongong District Court was told by the pro=
secution that Owen ran a "reasonably sophisticated" drug operation out of=
 two rooms in his parents' Figtree home, shipping MDMA (ecstasy), the horse=
 tranquiliser ketamine and methylamphetamine to customers across the countr=
y.<br><br>Police documents tendered to the court said police found various=
 amounts of drugs organised in Australia Post envelopes when Owen was pulle=
d over and his car searched in West Wollongong on April 27 last year.<br><b=
r>The envelopes were addressed to different people across the country. Poli=
ce also found more than $1000 cash and two mobile phones linked to Owen's=
 drug deals in the car.<br><br>However, the full extent of the drug operati=
on was not known until officers searched Owen's recently renovated bedroom.=
<br><br>Inside, they found a "mini office" with computers, a safe, drugs,=
 scales, cutting agents, about $14,000 in cash and a drug ledger with a rec=
ord of transactions.<br><br>An examination of Owen's mobile phone revealed=
 a user name and password for the Silk Road website, of which he was an act=
ive member for about two months.<br><br>An entry on the site spruiking Owen=
's wares promised "high quality crystal meth and high end MDMA".<br><br>"My=
 goal is a happy customer, unlike most (not all) meth dealers you meet face=
 to face," Owen wrote in an April 18, 2012, entry on the site.<br><br>The=
 court heard records from the website showed Owen supplied 172 MDMA pills=
 in 28 separate transactions from April 16 to April 26 last year, as well=
 as shipping three packages of unknown drugs in separate transactions durin=
g the same period.<br><br>In return, he received 1689.49 "Bitcoin" - the eq=
uivalent of $8447.45.<br><br>The court heard that Owen became hooked on ice=
 when he was 20 but managed to keep his addiction and drug operation a secr=
et from his parents.<br>See your ad here<br><br>Judge Paul Conlon yesterday=
 accepted that Owen had no prior criminal convictions, had good prospects=
 of rehabilitation and had entered guilty pleas at the earliest opportunity=
, entitling him to a 25 per cent discount on his final sentence.<br><br>He=
 ordered Owen to spend a minimum of 5=C2=BD years in jail with a further fi=
ve years on parole.<br><br>With time already served, Owen will be eligible=
 for parole on October 26, 2017.

				whether he was being targeted before this traffic stop, we don't know.=
=C2=A0 What's scary is this, he was keeping a ledger and he had his SR user=
/pass right out in the open in his phone.=C2=A0 Which means LE could login=
 as him, see all his history which they can match up to his ledger to gain=
 a bigger picture.=C2=A0 They can take over his account and do all sorts of=
 nefarious shit.<br><br>As far as who it was, could be one of those times=
 where a trusted vendor had all the sudden stopped shipping and messaging=
 for a length of time.=C2=A0 When LE takes=C2=A0 it over, depending on what=
 they want to do with it, could easily make up some excuse for why they sto=
pped shipping and answering messages.=C2=A0 Then from there, who knows what=
 they do.<br><br>The scary part is.... how many other vendors here keep led=
gers of any kind, whether it be some spreadsheet on their PC or some paper=
 copy they have laying around.=C2=A0 How many keep our addresses in some sh=
ape or form, for whatever reason.... to keep a list of their customers, to=
 have addresses to help pinpoint customers who might be trying to scam them=
.=C2=A0 <br><br>We know there are going to be security conscious vendors wh=
o do everything to protect themselves and their customers, and there's goin=
g to be vendors that try and be safe but are lax in certain areas and then=
 we got vendors who probably don't give a shit or vendors who aren't very=
 computer literate and therefore everything is out there in the open.<br><b=
r>We just saw from the vendor that got hacked.=C2=A0 He fell for a easy to=
 spot fake message, then fell for clicking on some random site that got him=
 to give up his PIN number.=C2=A0 The message didn't even pass a PGP signat=
ure verification.=C2=A0 We see all those vendors who say "ahh, pgp if you=
 have to, but not necessary"<br><br>One should not only be researching vend=
ors who ship out as advertised product, who have good communication, who ha=
ve good stealth, but also ones that you trust are probably not saving your=
 personal info in any way.<br><br>I've been in IT for over 2 decades and I=
 have seen it all, when it comes to what people do on their PC's.=C2=A0 Wha=
t they save, where they save it and how stealthy they actually are.=C2=A0=
 You would be amazed at the amount of personal info that people save and ho=
w easy they make to find it or be able to access it.

				Woollongong is a few hours drive south of Sydney Oz, and is almost be=
 described as=C2=A0 "a big country town" . . . any 20yo kid with a bit of=
 cash and a flash car, and no visible income becomes a target for local cop=
s, who target the local kids anyway ... but, this kid was probably driving=
 a bit fast and got pulled, and in Oz, when they stop you, they dont really=
 need a 'reason' to search you,<br>just a "suspicion" you "might have" drug=
s or weapons in the vehicle.=C2=A0 <br><br>In Oz,=C2=A0 =C2=A0a traffic sto=

 they pulled this kid, and the contraband they found in the car, gave them=
 a reason to search his house...his parent's house where this "20 and bulle=
tproof" kid felt completely secure . . . who knows what his parents did, bu=
t he might/must have "thought" the cops would never raid them...and maybe=
 he was right, that is UNTIL the cops pull him over with tons of fuckin evi=

=C2=A0As many have commented=C2=A0 pool playa in particular, I have to agre=
e, it=C2=A0 IS truly scary, <br>=C2=A0 BUT, fortunately we can fairly safel=
y assume the "weak link in the chain" here, was the kid, and his driving/ca=

 had made someone angry/jealous in this relatively small town (IIRC &lt;50,=

 speed limit=C2=A0 for 15-20kms either side of any of these "regional citie=

 too many traffic tickets going through Woolongong! and dozens from regiona=
l zones within 20kms of one of these big towns/small cities<br><br>And Wool=
ongong is a Cunt of a place really, 20 odd years ago it was a dark dirty to=
wn that kinda weirded me out, now they've tarted the place up and it's beco=
me more touristy .... fucked if I can figure why anyone would WANT to go to=
 there, except when passing through, like about 50,000 cars a day do... lot=

				Any vendor running a decent sized OP probably has people working for hi=

nsive email account that is secure, all messages we send use 4096 bit RSA=
 asymmetric key encryption and the account can be deleted with a click of=
 a bottom with nothing stored after the account is deleted. The FED's would=
 have to show up at the of shore hosting provider with warrants in hand the=

 The thing about jail/prison is that the first time its not the length so=

 we could both make a statement of solidarity and make the prospect of arre=

 they could link it back to Silk Road because of lax security. I read a lot=

 that and this quote I believe he did get busted. "A drug dealer's February=
 arrest in New Zealand was referred to as the first ever criminal convictio=

 gain information about the dealer from his Silk Road profile, so they warn=

 revealed anything on his profile but rather was caught through selling in=
 real life or crappy posting/using easily traced courier services.. Really=
 I don't know what happened but he sure is gone!=20

				I don't know the full facts of this case. Having his SilkRoad username=

 agree with everything you said. Drugs are illegal, but for what reason? It=
 has been proven that alcohol is far more harmful and addictive than some=
 illegal drugs, yet people selling them or using them are criminals? It doe=
sn't make sense, but the vast majority of the population is too stupid to=
 use their own brains and think beyond what the Government has told them an=
d many people are actually terrified of drugs. Some people believe that if=
 they smoke marijuana, that will be their gateway drug to heroin, and if th=
ey try marijuana just once, they will end up being a junkie living on the=
 street. <br><br>So this guy made mistakes, but now he is in jail and the=
 rest of his life will be ruined because of his convictions. Travelling ove=
rseas will be difficult, getting a job, etc.<br><br>And yes Australia is a=
 nanny country already and it is only get worse rapidly. I don't understand=
 why people diminish their freedom and demand the Government protect them=
 from every potential threat. Nick Xenophon is one of the worst. I don't se=
e why the Government has to regulate every aspect of everything from wearin=
g helmets on bicyles to trying to limit pokie machines. Do people have no=
 self-control to be able to stop themselves from playing pokie machines? I=
 just don't see the point in limiting bets to $1. And then we have the inte=
rnet filter and the long list of banned movies and books in Australia becau=
se the classification board thinks they are too violent. Can't adults decid=
e what they watch? Why does Australia always need edited games and movies,=
 simply because the Government says it's too inappropriate?

				This is purely a guess, but based on a few of the reported facts, this=
 bloke could be the former vendor DownUnderDan. The dates seem to line up=
 between when his vendor's account was taken over by an unknown person purp=
orting to be him (before eventually and some what mysteriously coming to a=
 sudden close) and when this guy was arrested back in April 2012. He is als=
o the only vendor I can recall selling only MDMA and Ice. I can't remember=
 him selling Ketamine but I could be wrong. He also might have had the Ket=
 for personal use only and not for sale. The MDMA and Ice only theory seems=
 to be supported with the police detailing an entry on his SR Homepage stat=
ing - <br><br>An entry on the site spruiking Owen's wares promised "high qu=
ality crystal meth and high end MDMA". <br><br>I am 95% sure that DownUnder=
Dan used the following line (below) on his Homepage too as it rings a bell=
 for me - <br><br>"My goal is a happy customer, unlike most (not all) meth=
 dealers you meet face to face," Owen wrote in an April 18, 2012, entry on=
 the site.<br><br>I know some people thought he was from QLD but I can't th=
ink of anyone else it could possibly be. That combined with the date he was=
 arrested and the type of drugs he sold has me thinking it's him. The only=

oyAus, but he never sold Meth or Ketamine.<br><br>Any other thoughts guys??=

 you. Whilst drug trafficking in the US might get you a longer prison sente=

 that Australia does on catching drug users. People with personal amounts=
 of drugs are targeted heavily here. Sniffer dogs are frequently at train=
 stations, streets, nightclubs, always at festivals. All they do is catch=
 end drug users and bring in revenue for the Government. Most possession of=
 drug offences are just a fine, possibly with a conviction recorded.<br></b=

0 purchase of crack. I know the Police here will arrest some people for car=
rying a pill but having been on both sides of fence, I'll take the Australi=
an Police over an American Officer any day of the week. The US put a lot of=
 resources into street level dealers and users and are like a dog with a bo=

 balls here for a copper to search your car or yourself in my opinion. I've=

m not the only one who thinks this way. It seems that most of the populatio=
n is happy to sit back and accept that everything that is not beneficial to=
 the economy or potentially unhealthy be banned. Nothing infuriates me more=
 than seeing the Government ban things because if they are banned, they wil=
l "help economic growth." Fuck economic growth. I would rather be able to=
 choose what I do in my lifetime and enjoy my life than lad a dull lifestyl=
e with boundaries and restrictions on everything and have 5% more money to=
 spend.<br><br>I don't smoke, but I think tobacco should be legal for anyon=
e who is old enough to make their decisions (18+) because it doesn't affect=
 me, same with gay marriage and gay rights and every other thing that harms=
 nobody but the person concerned. I really cannot see why gay people can't=
 get married. It makes people happy, so why not allow it? I understand some=
 Christian groups are against it, but it still doesn't affect them, What ab=
out Julia Gillard? She is an atheist and she is still against gay marriage=
 - She has no reason not to allow it other than because she is controlling=
 and manipulative. Pokie machines aren't of much interest to me either, but=
 I still like the fact that if I ever want to use one, I can.<br><br>Fast=
 food is by far the biggest health concern in Australia, yet it is totally=
 ignored. I am against tax hikes for unhealthy food, because I know that it=
 would start out as a small tax on some items and then gradually increase=
 and extend to more and more food groups. I think the Government should enc=
ourage healthy eating, but no further action is needed. People need to take=
 responsibility for themselves. The more the Government restricts things an=
d governs every aspect of everything, the less responsibility people will=
 take for themselves. It will spiral out of control and in the end everyone=
 will be told exactly what to do and what not to do because they do not kno=
w how to take responsibility for themselves. It is already heading that way=
. I know people on here will call me out for saying what I'm saying is extr=
eme, but if it keeps going the way it is, it will end up like that.<br><br>=
I think it is quite contradictory to see people coming on to the forum of=
 a drug-selling website and saying pokie machines should be banned because=
 they aren't beneficial to society. We are all here because we use drugs,=
 which are NOT beneficial. Yes, they are fun and can expand our thought pro=
cesses, but they are in no way beneficial. Drugs make our lives more intere=
sting and give us something else to enjoy, just as pokie machines would do=
 for other people.

 Machines are like an escapism from the pressures of everyday life, just as=
 drugs and alcohol are too for some of us. Some people love to play the pok=
ie's in the hope they get the free spins, some play solely to win cash and=
 some of us have a go when where out and about after a few coldies. Each to=
 their own. It's a choice an adult is more than capable of making without=
 the need for a Government to implement rules and restrictions and police=
 them. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is all it takes. We each have our weaknesses=
 and shouldn't put ourselves in situations where we may circum to them with=
out taking the necessary precautions, especially if your on your own. An al=
coholic would be silly to go to a pub for obvious reasons, just as a person=
 with a gambling addition should stay away from places like Casinos.<br>The=
re does need to be boundaries with all things in life but one should feel=
 free to live life as they choose within those confines, as long as your ac=
tions don't interfere with or affect others. A "freedom of choice" if you=
 like. Remember, there's more than one way to skin a cat. Which ever method=
 you chose to do so is really irrelevant as you end up with the same result=
, a cat with no skin.<br>Yes, there are plenty of other forms of gambling=
 which people could enjoy but whether you're playing the pokies or betting=
 on horses, at the end of the day you're gambling! One form is not better=
 than the other and just as some people enjoy a day at the races, others lo=
ve a beer and a flutter on the pokies. It's a choice we should all be entit=
led to make as adults instead of having a Government intervene with ridicul=
ous laws and regulations that they couldn't police anyway. Pokies are machi=

</div></div><blockquote class=3D"bbc_alternate_quote"><br>Yep. 100% agree=
 with you again! Personal responsibility with freedom of choice is how it=

selves for a long time, with powerful lobbies (billions of $, involving add=
s, politics etc.), they had been knowing for a very long time that they wer=

 wait until smoking is really integrated in society and now try to stop peo=
ple from smoking. <br>We're manipulated. By whom ? Politics, education, mar=

 good informations - it's obvious we don't have access easily to these.<br>=
Also about politic and public organizations that can regulate things.<br><b=

 what you call freedom is just a way to let only some people overwhelm the=
 economy by taking profit of the weaker.<br>We don't all have the same educ=

 constantly worse too. <br><br>Yes I can see tobacco companies promote thei=
r products (although they can't in Australia anymore), but so does junk foo=
d. <br>These things are available for anyone to consume, but it should be=
 our option to control ourselves. I just think that by constantly regulatin=

 that way.<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div class=3D"botslic=

co as an example, junk food is another one. I smoke, and sometimes eat junk=
 food.<br>You way of thinking is just too optimistic or elitist. People, be=
cause they're dying of tobacco, will stop smoking. Or because fast food is=
 unhealthy, they will eat vegetables ? That point of view is really not rea=
listic, pragmatic nor convincing ! <br><br>Give a child an unhealthy hambur=
ger and some vegetables :=C2=A0 what, according to you, is he going to eat=
 ??<br>It's not about self control, only about education, as i said, and in=
formation.<br>About this example - food, you probably know that your palate=
 starts developing before your birth. If a baby has only been used to eat=
 sweet food, he probably won't ever love vegatables - which are healthier=
 (i mean genuinely).<br><br>I'm really not saying governments should make=
 law for everything. But you have to remember that information is the key=

 are one of the big lobby. <br><br>Why ? Money ... but not money for everyo=

><div class=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div><br>No one pushes anyone into do=
ing anything italosvevo. It's a choice that an individual will make based=
 on what they know about a particular subject. Sure, at times we can all ge=
t a little down on ourselves through circumstances which really make life=
 hard, such as a death of someone close, a loss of your job or bugger all=
 money to spend on some of life's pleasures.<br>However, we are all born as=
 equals in the sense that every child is able to get an education through=
 the local Public and High Schools. School fees are not compulsory for pare=
nts to pay, although most do pay them. There has been advertisements at var=
ious locations for many, many years, mainly public areas and alike and with=
 the invention of the TV, that has continued to grow to it's current state=
 today. To suggest that advertising is the reason your being forced to buy=
 something is crazy. Again, instead of blaming the media, we should look at=
 taking some personal responsibility for the choices we make. We all have=
 choices to make at certain times in life which will affect our lives drama=
tically. <br>If you give a child an unhealthy hamburger and some vegetables=
, what will he/she eat. The answer is what ever they get to eat from me whi=
ch I feel is suitable for their needs at the time. If they don't like it,=
 they won't be eating. I guarantee you though that the kids will eat virtua=
lly anything you give them if you establish the boundaries with them early=
 on and stick to them. If a parent curtails to the ads on TV (fast food) as=
 a result of the kids having a tantrum then you're setting a precedent for=
 your kids on what they have to do to get what they want. Kids need to be=
 guided through life with a set of boundaries for them not to cross. Explai=
n to them that if they break the rules by crossing the boundary, there will=
 be consequences for their actions. If they break the rules, parents MUST=
 follow through with a punishment so the kids know your serious about it an=
d won't be backing down. They soon realize that if they stay within the bou=
ndary and play, they won't be in any trouble and can still enjoy themselves=
 just as much. <br><br><div class=3D"quoteheader"><div class=3D"topslice_qu=

 many years ago. These will require updates and new assessments should be=
 done as times change. A law made in 1923 will no doubt need to be adjusted=

 person is entitled to as a result of the current minimum requirements set=
 out in our Industry Standards. People create their own path in life throug=

 and theirs alone.
