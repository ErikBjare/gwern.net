				Hi.<br><br>Welcome to CAD.<br><br>So I think we should have an up-to-da=

cussion where we can discuss the current batches around and exchange test=
 results. It would be ace if we could get lab scans for these guys posted=
 as well.<br><br>Would be good if we could get this pinned :)<br><br>---<br=

				+1 to get this pinned. Much more informative than LSD vendor pinned lis=
t and also not full of bias. Would be great to see more lab test. ecstacyda=
ta will do personalized lab test(although i'm sure there are others), howev=
er ED requires $120 for things not ecstacy PLUS as least 20mg of substance=
 which will be destroyed after test. This would be somewhere between 250-35=
0 hits at 75ug just to get a result. Im sure there is something more practi=
cal.

				Awesome :) We should somehow get that tester thread realized soonish (s=
everal weeks/few months sounds soonish and realistic to me) and link it up=
 with this idea. That would be terrific.<br><br>Regarding the dalai lamas=

 strong and clean. I'm with peaceloveharmony in that most blotters are gros=

				I think the Buddhas, Ganeshas and Hoffmans are all interchangeable. Tho=
ugh you may be right and Hoffmans are better on average, but I have also se=
en batches of the Hoffmans tested at 75ug and the Ganeshas tested at 90ug.=
 It really depends on the batch I guess. I personally would not ever charge=
 different prices for them.<br><br>I am not sure how much crystal quality=
 translates into the quality of the trip. I definitely think that people bl=
ame the acid too quickly when they have got a shit trip, as there are so ma=

 superior, and I am not sure this is just due to the quantity of crystal on=
 them.<br><br>I took the Red Ganeshas out of the bunk section, as somebody=
 reported earlier that they liked them. I remember people calling them bunk=
 because they were unevenly laid and very low dosed. Though always stayed=
 away from them. Somebody got more information?<br><br>Also took the Flying=
 Keys out the bunk section. I do think it was justified putting them there=
 with their meager 30ug, but I guess technically they are not bunk.<br><br>=
Uh and somebody tell me what the hell Krishnas are :) Are they just a diffe=

				I went through a few of these and found them really nice. It is an othe=

 I had was tasteless, just paper tasted, and the time line fits perfectly=
 in the for L expected schedule.=C2=A0 <br>Strength wise like the Hoffmans=

<br><br>@asbjorn: If you ever get your hand on some of the calendar trips=
 (or equal good ones) please do not tell anyone, just PM me and sell me som=

t were lab tested by the DIZ(Drug testing organization in Switzerland)and=
 contained 170ug. <br>But i don't know which batch is sold around here atm.=
 Maybe Asbjorns estimation of 130-150ug is correct.<br><br>The ones that ar=
e listed as "crystal:grey?" are actually Amber(based on my information.)<br=
>Amber is the standard for Bulk LSD and is always available in large quanti=

acer.gov/<br>There you can look up the evidence(LSD that was tested) that=
 was used in the Picard case. <br><br>And this goes on and on...<br><br>So=

e of the info from other people. None of this is fully authoritative, but=
 it is based on having been around both European and American acid scenes=
 on and off for decades, and also spending a fair amount of time on relevan=
t forums.<br><br>Firstly, in terms of the info still in the OP - dancing be=
ars are not GDF. As indicated in the comments from Tarp which sd4sd4 quoted=
, they are made by the same group as the Shivas and the Dalai Lamas. My und=
erstanding is that this is a Northern European group (usually assumed to be=
 Dutch but I've heard it claimed they are actually based in Sweden) who rou=
tinely use the standard fluff synthesis for all of their crystal. It's gene=
rally stated that the dancing bears are, as someone put it, their 'disco do=
se' offering, the Shivas are their standard trademark batches and the Dalai=
 are their high-end, high-dose version. My guess would be that the use of=
 the dancing bear motif is a deliberate tribute to GDF, given that they are=
 dosed with supposedly identical crystal at around the standard classic GDF=
 dose of 100 mics / hit. But strictly speaking they are not GDF. GDF have=
 never distributed in Europe on any kind of scale. <br><br>'Needlepoint' is=
 not a higher grade of crystal than 'Swiss Bliss' and neither of these are=
 technical terms. 'Needlepoint' is just US slang for very high grade crysta=
l which takes on the distinctive appearance of tiny translucent needles. Wh=
ile it is true that Sand and others=C2=A0 (including the British chemist Ri=
chard Kemp) went after a higher grade of purity than Sandoz, it's also true=
 that Sandoz crystal reputedly had just the same 'needle-like' appearance.=
 So basically 'needlepoint' and 'Swiss' are just different names for crysta=
l made according the most classical synthesis methods which is purified to=
 above 95%. The Swiss chemists actually produce various grades of crystal=
 but all of them are very high purity and they all look basically like what=
 Americans call 'needlepoint'. I've had both high-grade Swiss (in liquid fo=
rm and on the Mayans) and GDF needlepoint in the past year and I would have=
 to say that the Swiss feels purer, if anything. <br><br>I'm not sure what=
 to make of gammagoblin's comments on the Dalais. I've never taken them but=
 I've kind of followed their career vicariously and I have to say that this=
 is almost the only set of such reports I've ever heard. I did read one guy=
 on bluelight saying that he thought there was some kind of impurity on the=
 Dalais but he was a bit of an idiot generally. I have to say that with ver=
y high-dose hits like that, if you're taking them at festivals in the middl=
e of summer or whatever, then you can get all kinds of weird reactions just=
 because you can get hot, dehydrated, forget to drink or eat for 12 hours,=
 etc. <br><br>In terms of what the difference is between crystal types - th=
ere is a lot of nonsense talked on forums and there are some points which=
 seem to be common to people who know what they are talking about. The nons=
ense generally revolves around things like physical symptoms or high levels=
 of anxiety being produced by impurities. This=C2=A0 mostly rubbish, becaus=
e you can take a high dose of the purest acid in the world and there is abs=
olutely no guarantee that you won't get symptoms ranging from stomach-cramp=
s to a full-range bad trip. On the other hand, these might all be secondary=
 symptoms which are made more likely by the primary difference between 'goo=
d' and 'bad' crystal...which is what exactly?<br><br>Well, the way that thi=
s is usually described, which I think is accurate, is to say that the key=
 difference is that at high doses, purer crystal makes it much easier to re=
tain a sense of mental clarity, whereas lower grade crystal becomes much mo=
re of a head-fuck. Please note the phrase 'easier'. 'Easier' does not mean=
 'guaranteed' - the fact that you have a head-fuck of a trip does not mean=
 that you necessarily have bad crystal. Conversely, if you are an experienc=
ed and generally positive-minded tripper under good conditions, then you ca=
n have a fantastic time on low-grade amber. <br><br>Finally I would have to=
 say that once you get into the higher grades of crystal - fluff, 'needlepo=
int', 'swiss' in various grades - then preferences between them seem to be=
 often matters of personal taste, and the ways in which people react seem=
 to vary between individuals. Some people do seem to have a better time on=
 fluff than on needlepoint for example, and some people seem to find that=
 the trip on fluff or on some grades of Swiss is somehow so 'refined' that=
 it never reaches the pitch of intensity that they get from other kinds of=
 needlepoint or even good-quality silver. Personally I like to have a choic=
e although if I had to pick one it would be the best of the Swiss. <br><br>=

				I just want to absolutely agree with the points about dosage. It's 200-=
250 where you really start tripping. Importantly, this means that if you ta=
ke two hits and you are not tripping absolute balls then those hits were NO=
T dosed at 150ug, as so many are claimed to be. I've seen more than one per=
son in this forum describe what they believed to be a 300ug trip which was=
 so clearly nowhere close. Trust me if you really take 2x150ug you will KNO=
W that something big is happening. <br><br>On the dosage history - an inter=
esting point. There is an interview online with Owsley somewhere where he=
 says that they only set the doses so high in the late 60s because 250ug ha=
d become established as the standard dose sort of by accident, partly becau=
se it was what Hoffman took on his first trip. Owsley reports a conversatio=
n with Hoffman around 1970=C2=A0 in which Hoffman tells Owsley that 250 is=
 way too much for a lot of people and that he should be making doses around=
 100. I believe this is when the standard family dose of 100 first got kind=
 of established.<br><br>I have to say that overall I think the family tradi=
tion of issuing doses in units of 100 and just letting everyone know that=
 you should take 2 or 3 for a real trip is still the best practice that any=
one has established. In Europe we get this situation wherein most hits are=
 only around 75 mics, but every couple of years there is a widely-distribut=
ed batch which is more like 200-250. The result of this is that lots of ord=
inary users are very nervous about taking multiple hits in case they get on=
e of the strong batches, and as a result they just never really experience=
 a full-blown trip - which leads to all this confusion about the reality of=
 dosages. <br><br>I really applaud the enterprise of gammagoblin in laying=
 their own sheets and I think more Europeans should do this. It's not that=
 hard for an enterprising vendor to find their way up the supply chain, sou=
rce some crystal, and lay it on some US-standard white watercolor paper. Ev=
erybody gets excited when one of these US vendors pops up claiming to be la=
ying their own sheets not just because of the family mystique but also just=
 because in practical terms it's the best way to ensure quality and consist=
ent dosage from supplier to vendor. If one of the Europeans could start doi=
ng this with the good Swiss crystal then they would really be onto somethin=

				That Nick Sand interview is fascinating - thanks for that HC and for yo=
ur other very interesting points. <br><br>(Of course Sand is mistaken in hi=
s claim that he was innovating in the mid-90s by putting out 100ug hits! Bu=
t he admits he was basically completely out of touch with any acid scene fr=
om the moment he went on the run...) <br><br>And yes that 100-200-300 formu=
lation is perfect :)<br><br>I've just read HC's earlier post about the diff=
erence between fluff and needlepoint. Apologies - I hadn't actually read th=
at when I posted my comments on those terms and they weren't intended as a=
 reply to HC's. <br><br>Yes HC's distinction makes perfect sense in terms=
 of what I know (which is nothing with any certainty). <br><br>Generally 'f=
luff' seems to be associated with groups producing very large amounts in a=
 clandestine situation but who retain a strong philosophical commitment to=
 the ideal of producing pure acid (so GDF in the US and 'Shiva Family' in=
 Europe - arguably the two main networks to enjoy a reputation for distribu=
ting white crystal over large populations). Fluff is supposed to be made us=
ing the synth techniques developed by Owsley, who was never actually a prof=
essional chemist, and so is supposed to be relatively easy to reproduce by=
 those who have the commitment, and are willing to reduce their profit marg=
ins by getting significantly less final product than they would get from ma=
king amber. <br><br>'Needlepoint' does indeed generally mean that it's comi=
ng from a professionally-equipped lab somewhere, which doesn't happen as of=
ten as you might expect; at least not on any kind of scale. In Europe the=
 traditional centers from which it was distributed have been Switzerland an=
d Czech. I don't know why this is, although it's easy enough to speculate=
 (I guess they're both places where for various historical, social, economi=
c, political, cultural reasons, it has been quite easy for chemists to get=
 access to good facilities without being subject to much supervision). The=
 actual final product hasn't traditionally been distributed from those loca=
tions, but has been laid or pressed into microdots in NL, from where it's=
 distributed. <br><br>That's how I understand it anyway but it could all be=
 wrong.=20

				Juergen2001 is selling what looks to be a new batch of high-potency blo=

 <br><br>I am quite tempted to order a strip and test them just to see how=

 first run or two of a new print, you can end up getting a very good ug/$=

				Horizons is correct<br><br>There's a long-running debate about whether=
 foil is a good idea outside of the freezer or fridge. There's an old belie=
f among the deadheads that keeping blotters wrapped in foil degrades them=
 because of some kind of chemical reaction. I've seen forum posts debunking=
 this scientifically but I don't know how authoritative they were, or wheth=
er the belief ever had a scientific basis to begin with. A friend of mine=
 suggested recently that maybe at high ambient temperatures, foil will actu=
ally start to 'bake' blotters and exacerbate heat degradation....I have no=
 idea really... could be...<br><br>I've heard of people keeping them just=
 wrapped in a piece of paper inside a book in a cool room and them staying=
 good for years. <br><br>But basically the thing is to freeze them. As long=
 as they are kept waterproof in the freezer you don't need to worry much ab=
out oxygen because they will be too cold for any reaction to take place. It=
's the same with any chemical - if its structure is not damaged by freezing=
, then freezing it will preserve it more or less indefinitely, because it=
 maintains it in a state of molecular stasis.<br><br>I guess the same princ=
iple applies if you vacuum seal them - if you do that then again, there sho=
uldn't be anything for the acid to react with even if it gets warm. But I=
 have stored blotters and microdots in a freezer for years and years withou=

				The economics of the LSD community have always made me laugh.<br><br>Fi=
rst off, let's start with the price per hour of intoxication. LSD is cheape=
r than nearly every drug besides cannabis in these terms...and LSD requires=
 a relatively complicated synthesis in a lab using hard to find precursors.=
 Cannabis damn near grows itself.<br><br>Second, unlike many drugs, you can=
't really use LSD frequently, so if you take the perspective of "if I do dr=
ug X as many times as I like (and am able) during the year, I would spend=
 Y dollars per year", so people should be willing to pay much more for LSD=
 than they do...if the price had been established long ago that a good soli=
d trip cost $50 or $100, I think people would have been fine with it. <br><=
br>Third, quality reliable supply is almost nonexistent, and demand is extr=
emely high. A vendor could setup shop in the US selling sheets for $750 and=
 if the acid is as claimed, people will bitch and call him greedy and beg=
 him to hold a sheet for them while they get the money together.<br><br>Thi=
s hippy nonsense about sharing the love blah blah blah...I love you guys,=
 but seriously? It's nice if people want to spit in the face of economics,=
 but understand they were essentially giving you free money by selling at=
 a price under the supply/demand curve. You can't be upset when reality set=
s in.

				I totally agree with envious. SR is a special case and you can't compar=

't have a real life connection(anymore) and that is the reason they buy on=
 SR.<br>I don't know the US market very well, but the real life prices in=
 Europe are not that high, in case your connect is even remotely good.<br>I=
'm out=C2=A0 for a while, but a few years back, the price for low quality=
 euro blotter was at about 80cent when you bought 5000 tabs. 100tabs for 38=
0=E2=82=AC.<br>The Quality was comparable to the Ganeshas and cartoon shiva=

over the course of 11 years. So "quality reliable supply is almost nonexist=
ent"?) that i got for a good price . So i could sell it really cheap and st=
ill make 100% profit. Is 500-1000% really necessary!?<br>+ I was/am totally=
 into the "hippy nonsense about sharing the love". LSD should be free imo.=
 But producing a high quality product costs money. That's the reality.<br>B=

				Pricing is a complicated thing. Where I live, LSD is extremely hard to=

				[SUMMARY: This is a trip report after taking half of one of juergen2001=
=E2=80=99s Mayas. I had a bad trip, but this was not the fault of the acid=
 itself. I have tried my best to distinguish between my individual experien=
ce and the =E2=80=9Cobjective=E2=80=9D qualities of the acid. Sorry for the=
 excessive length of the post.]<br><br>Recently I received a 5-strip of jue=
rgen2001=E2=80=99s Mayas. In eager anticipation of a high-dose trip that I=
 was planning to have with these on the weekend, on a whim I convinced myse=
lf that it would be a good idea to prematurely =E2=80=9Ctest=E2=80=9D a hal=
f-tab beforehand.<br><br>I=E2=80=99m an idiot. What ensued was a 8+ hour ni=
ghtmare in my head. I experienced mega paranoia and headfuck. I=E2=80=99m=
 pretty sure this was because my set and setting were all wrong rather than=
 the fault of the acid. I had some hours alone, but had to interact with no=
n-trippers for some of the trip, and became totally wigged out with negativ=
e thoughts, worry, and fear. I guess I deserve it for being too eager to tr=
ip and not just waiting until the setting was right. Lesson learned (again!=
). Luckily I am feeling back to normal after sleeping it off. I woke up thi=
s morning and was incredibly grateful for my sanity.<br><br>Since it was su=
ch a low dose trip, I don=E2=80=99t feel that I can give an overly extensiv=
e or fair review of the Mayas, but I will say a few things:<br><br>I undere=
stimated the strength of these. Whilst I wasn=E2=80=99t launched flying out=
 into space, I was definitely insane for the day. I experienced significant=
 euphoria and OEVs, albeit milder and with less intensity than what one wou=
ld experience on a standard dose. In the first half of the trip, my thought=
s were racing very fast, and I found it impossible to sit still or concentr=
ate on anything. I was buzzing around like a tweaker with mega ADD. The who=
le experience was overwhelming because it was more than I bargained for. I=
 was shocked that half of a tab could be so strong. By the second half of=
 the trip, I was able to sit down in one place, but was still very fidgety.=
 I experienced some incredibly negative thoughts about myself that left me=
 feeling really depressed. It was so mentally exhausting. I felt like one=
 half of my brain was at war with the other. (It should be noted that I hav=
e a history of depression and anxiety and am not at a particularly good pla=
ce in my life right now, so I shouldn=E2=80=99t really be surprised that I=
 had such a bad trip.)<br><br>This was the most incredibly CLEAN feeling LS=
D I have ever experienced (having tripped 11 times now on varying doses -=
 usually low to medium, but some high - over a period of about 6 years). I=
 could not believe how clean it felt. I am very overweight and don=E2=80=99=
t look after myself too well, so I usually experience terrible, heavy bodyl=
oad on acid, with my stomach gurning badly, especially on the comedown. Thi=
s is usually noticeable for me even on low dose trips. I didn=E2=80=99t hav=
e any of these problems on the half tab of the Mayas. It was a really nice,=
 speedy euphoric high that I enjoyed very much before things got out of con=
trol.<br><br>I stopped tripping after about 8-10 hours, but still felt very=
 weirded out and paranoid afterwards. I wasn=E2=80=99t able to sleep until=
 about 17 hours after dropping the acid. I suffer from insomnia and usually=
 find it very difficult to fall asleep under any conditions, and especially=
 after taking acid. I didn=E2=80=99t notice any significant CEVs and wouldn=
=E2=80=99t really expect them on such a low dose.<br><br>It felt very diffe=
rent to acid I have taken in the past. However, I think this may be because=
 I was mainly getting lower quality, less pure stuff over the years (I assu=
me amber crystal grade). As far as I can tell from the half-tab I took, the=
 Mayas seem to be great quality acid. A higher dose of these in the right=
 setting has the potential to be pretty damn amazing. As stated, I just was=
n=E2=80=99t in the right headspace or physical setting and had a difficult=
 trip =E2=80=93 this was nothing to do with the acid itself.<br><br>I would=
 assume that these are not an RC. However, I have never taken RCs before an=
d don't really know how to tell the difference, so please don't take my wor=
d for it without testing them for yourself. I've tried to research the effe=
cts of LSD vs. DOx on various Internet forums, but it's still hard to know=
 without having tried each substance individually, since the effects are re=
putedly so similar. LSD tends to feel different to me every time I take it,=
 depending on my mood, dose, setting, the strength of the blotter, and puri=
ty of the crystal. The Maya tab felt like acid - just much more clean-feeli=
ng acid than usual and quite strong. It took about an hour to come up, whic=
h is pretty standard for me.<br><br>Unfortunately I=E2=80=99m scared to tri=
p again for a while after this experience. I really shouldn=E2=80=99t mess=
 with this stuff until I get some shit sorted out. On a more positive note,=
 today I feel much happier and motivated to try harder in the aspects of my=
 life that are lacking. I guess bad trips are sometimes useful in exposing=
 aspects of your life that need improvement and therefore help us to become=
 better people.<br><br>[WARNING: I just want to remind people that taking=
 half of a tab of acid is nothing like taking half of a pill or drinking ha=
lf of a beer. I read some disgusting posts on Bluelight where some people=
 claimed that they even drive on low dose LSD trips!! (After giving it some=
 thought, I=E2=80=99m convinced that no one on Bluelight actually really ta=
kes drugs and that it=E2=80=99s just a bunch of kids writing bullshit, but=
 that=E2=80=99s not the point =E2=80=93 driving on any substance is just fu=
cking irresponsible and shameful). Don=E2=80=99t be stupid. Get your set an=
d setting right or be prepared to be kicked in the arse. Low dose acid is=
 still acid, just less intense than a higher dose trip. I=E2=80=99m ashamed=
 of myself for throwing caution to the wind and disrespecting psychedelics=
 in the way that I just did. Acid is not something to be taken casually in=
 the middle of the week when you are unprepared. Be warned - this stuff can=
 literally send you mad.]

<br>Haha, I didn't think half a hit would do anything either!! That's why=
 I freaked the fuck out when it was so strong.<br><br>Perhaps I don't have=
 much tolerance - the last time I tripped before this was a month ago. And=
 as stated, I've spaced out my trips over the course of several years.<br><=
br>Edit: Also, if you read my post correctly, I did say that the euphoria=
 and OEVs were much MILDER and LESS INTENSE than a standard dose. The probl=
em was that I had a massive panic attack, so everything probably seemed lik=
e a bigger deal than it really was. You are free to dismiss my report if yo=
u don't believe me, but I assure you I am not trolling or making this shit=
 up - it happened. I took the half as soon as I woke up, without having eat=
en anything, which may have contributed to feeling stronger effects than on=
e would expect.

				Hey guys, just a quick update on the Mayas:<br><br>I ended up taking 1=
 and a half tabs a couple of days after my bad trip on the half-tab.<br><br=

ing right and chill the fuck out, hehe. I can=E2=80=99t believe I panicked=
 so much the other day.<br><br>Here=E2=80=99s what I can say about the acid=
:<br><br>-Nice, incredibly CLEAN euphoric body high. Felt very clearheaded=
 and relaxed, with no nausea or bodyload (which is amazing to me because ac=
id usually makes my body feel like crap).<br><br>-Strong OEVs, but seemed=
 kind of different to the OEVs I usually get on acid. They were more fleeti=
ng and cartoon-like rather than the swirling fractals that I=E2=80=99m used=
 to.<br><br>-I was so relaxed that I was able to fall asleep whilst still=
 tripping and entered an interesting acid-dream state.<br><br>-The high was=
n=E2=80=99t too intense, but definitely took me to another dimension.<br><b=
r>Overall, it is good, clean acid and highly recommended. My only regret is=
 that I didn=E2=80=99t buy more of these!! :D

				Thank you very much blockrockinbeats for your reviews on the mayas. I=
 got a 10 strip of them too very recently and actually made the very same=
 mistake you did, though not ending up in a bad trip.<br><br>I also wanted=
 to "sample" them, despite knowing better, but as I really have no problem=
 about my mindset right now but only the setting wasn't picked properly, I=
 ended up having a very cleansing and insightful experience. Here's what ha=
ppened: <br><br>I got the letter send to a friend's and joined him after wo=
rk on the day I supposed the acid to arrive. As this was my first transacti=
on on SR I was probably a bit over-excited about my drugs from the internet=
 to arrive, so I wanted to check the actual quality as soon as possible. I=
 took a quarter of tab at about 8pm and another quarter an hour and a bit=
 later (I weigh only like 120lb, so I wanted to take it carefully as I alre=
ady read some reviews about these being quite strong). <br><br>I was amongs=
t friends who were not tripping, but felt safe at my friends house and had=
 a bed to crash there in case needed (which I should have made use of in re=
trospect). It was very much a "me"-trip, very thoughtful and I felt fulfill=
ed with a great curiosity about the world surrounding me and the whole inte=
rconnectedness in it while the trip was slowly rising up. However, I should=
 not have split the dose because so I did not realize when I was gonna peak=
 and that it would still become way more intense when my friend said he was=
 gonna go to bed at about half past eleven. I felt very much in control at=
 that point so I decided to walk home which I had figured before would be=
 problematic because I'm not very satisfied with my living-situation right=
 now (mostly esthetic stuff and my room in my shared appartment being a lit=
tle small for tripping). But I was too busy exploring mental spaces to reme=
mber that at that moment=C2=A0 :o <br><br>The way way home was fantastic,=
 I felt connected even to the few non-trippers I saw on my way and there wa=
s one small fraction of the way were people are known to get mugged and I'm=
 getting paranoid there even when completely sober, but I managed to mainta=
in the great experience not only there but also at the border I had to cros=
s to get home. <br><br>When I arrived at about midnight, having had a great=
 walk with fantastic music on my earphones behind me, I was thinking to be=
 pretty much at peak of the trip, having hardly any visual effects but a ve=
ry strong emotional and deep-thoughted trip so far. Probably because of thi=
s being quite introverted I did not notice the trip was still getting stron=
ger and when I watched my own face on my web cam to see if anything interes=
ting would happen I was a bit frightened by the distortions suddenly kickin=
g in. I mentioned my small room, so you can imagine it took a bit of self-c=
ontrol to not slip into a circle of fear and first I tried to divert myself=
 from the fear by playing some positive music and doing some (mostly symbol=
ic :D ) cleaning up, but what in the end got me over this brief horror (and=
 it was really intense!) was actually facing it and investigating its natur=
e, to at the end realize there is nothing to be afraid of at all. <br><br>Y=
ou can imagine this was an extremely intense self-reflection which I would=
 not recommend to practice for anyone inexperienced with psychedelics AND=
 without at least some sort of training in psychology and effective self-re=
flection techniques! For me this was great and although I would not go as=
 far to call it a life-changing experience strictly speaking (although ever=
y intense experience of course influences the rest of your life ofc), but=
 defintely had a real self-therapeutic impact.<br><br>This deep self-reflec=
tion process took about two hours, which felt like ages and apart from the=
 10 minutes which re-defined my idea of horror I was so focused (strange wo=
rd in this context, I know, but that's how it felt - focused on letting my=
 self-healing abilities come to work in a natural flow) that I completely=
 skipped the visual part apart from the brief terrifying distortions of my=
 face and surroundings.<br><br>I plan on going on a stronger-dosed tripped=
 with some friends soon, which is supposed to be more of a "we"-trip :)<br>=
<br>Having written this lengthy text I can only repeat blockrockinbeats war=
ning: Don't mess with this stuff, particularly if you do not know how you=
 can handle this sort of substance! driving under the influence of LSD in=
 plainly mental, the thing it tends to do is not let you notice how fucked-=
up you already are until it's too late! You cannot dose LSD so carefully th=
at you could drive, that's against the very nature of this drug!<br>Also,=
 always take care you pick the setting right and have the right mindset whe=
n planning on taking a strong psychedelic like LSD, because what I experien=
ced can be extremely traumatizing or even trigger latent psychosis to many=
 other people with a different background!<br><br>That being said: happy tr=
ipping! :)<br><br>Edit: made little better readable and want to attach my=
 quality judgement too of course: as being said here multiple time the Maya=
n Calendars are very clean and strong acid, nothing to add :)

				Hey all,<br><br>Just wanted to pitch in on Juergen's Mayas... Tripped=
 with a friend on Saturday, each of us with one tab. We went hiking and too=
k the cid at a little cabin in the woods. The trip was really gorgeous and=
 very clean. Personally, I had barely any visual distortions, only at one=
 or two moments and then quite intensely, while my friend had a great deal=
 of them. This didn't bother me at all though, since I was incredibly absor=
bed by nature and everything I looked at. A really beautiful trip. We had=
 the time of our lives hiking back down the hill through the majestic fores=
t. The comedown was very gentle and relaxed. <br>Definitely an A++ from thi=
s inexperienced user. I hope they come back soon, I'd definitely buy again.

rmtrooper, <br><br>I recently purchased the "Alex Grey and a. Hofman, new=
 edition" LSDs from Juergen2001 and tried one tab while being on holiday th=
e other week. I'm not a big expert on LSD (yet! :P) and I can only compare=
 to one other experience I had on another tab I bought directly from Berlin=
. The Hofman experience was interesting. There was definitely euphoria, int=
rospection, some limited visuals e.g. I was watching the clouds in the sky=
 above and at instances it looked like I was looking at earth from space fr=
om behind the clouds. Music did sound amazing (e.g. Royksopp) but not to le=
vels of perfection I reached during my first trip where classical pieces li=
ke Chopin's nocturnes sounded so profound. Also no out of body experience=
 this time. However the setting might have played a role in the not so big=
 profoundness of the experience because we were on the mountains and I trie=
d to remain aware in case we were approached by other people. Also I was ne=
ver left completely alone during the Hoffmans session, which I think does=
 play a part (i.e. at some points you need to let go, and you can't complet=
ely let go when communicating continuously with another person).<br><br>Bod=
yload wise they did cause some nausea and slight urge to vomit at the start=
 of the trip, which from what I read on the forums is an indication that it=
's not the best purity LSD possible. <br><br>I still got some Hoffmans left=
 and I plan to trying them again (making taking 2 tabs and being by myself=
 next time).<br>

As a partial answer to your questions I would guess that Tony's tabs are at=
 least 100ug if not more. I've tried everything from the LSDirect's Fantasi=
a tabs and WoW to Envious's WoW and Del Ellis's WoW, all of which have are=
 known to be good, potent stuff, and find Tony's LSD comparable if not stro=
nger. In fact it didn't feel a much weaker than the Avatar tabs which have=
 been rated at 130-150ug. I did take Tony's tabs after a long period of not=
 using so I'm sure my low tolerance played a part but with just one I was=
 blown away and shocked at how powerful it was. I assumed it would be a low=
-dosage trip and while still light enough to be calm and manageable I did=
 not feel like I was missing something or needed to go higher, which is oft=
en the case with other 100ug tabs I've tried.<br><br>Let us know what you=
 find out HC!

 tolerance with LSD, our plan is for this coming Saturday to candyflip MDMA=
+LSD.<br>Is that a waist ??<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><div=
 class=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div><br>AFAIK MDA causes cross-tolerance=
 with MDMA, but not with LSD.<br></blockquote><div class=3D"quotefooter"><d=
iv class=3D"botslice_quote"></div></div><br>mda has no tolerance with lsd=
 or mdma i believe...serotonin depletion from mda is similar to mdma though=
 so space dosing accordingly.

				An update and dosage estimate on 3janes cid. Myself and 3 others have=
 all taken from 1-2 two hits. We have all had "confirmed" 100ug (GDF/Americ=
an) and 80ug (Euro Buddha/Ganesha) hits from the likes of Enelysion, Asbjor=
n, and USDirect, so we are using those doses for our 100ug and 80ug compari=
son.<br><br>Also, the print should be described properly on here. The image=
 on the front is a Seed of Life mandala. I've been referring to these as su=
ch.<br><br>My personal first hand account:<br><br>3Jane's LSD feels very cl=
ean. On one hit, the come up is smooth and almost wraps you into a psychede=
lic soft blanket. The peak was reached around hour 3, and continued for abo=
ut 3 more hours. Visuals were minor, but present. Lots of color pops, "3D"=
 effect of graffiti on walls. iPhone's looking 3D with the icons moving aro=
und. All typical of a light visual experience. Sleep was possible after 12=
 hours. There were no other drugs involved in this experience. That being=
 said, 1 hit will not rock your world as much as 1 hit of Ene's, USD's, or=
 even in my personal experience (some friends/researchers disagree) the com=
mercial Euro blotter that Asbjorn was selling on here in the Fall. <br><br>=
I believe the actual crystal on the paper to be much cleaner than the stand=
ard Euro blotter (Ganesha, Buddha), and about the same purity as Ene's and=
 USD. (White/Silver 90%+)<br><br>And of course, how strong are they? After=
 multiple experiments with multiple experienced people, we all agree on a=
 range of 60-80ug per tab. Yup, 60-80ug. I know that's a variable range, bu=
t that's the closest we can come as a group of very experienced and detail=
 oriented trippers.
