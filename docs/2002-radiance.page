> by Carter Scholz

## Cover

![Front & back cover of first Picador hardcover edition](/images/2002-radiance-cover.png)

## Jacket copy

> Somewhere in California, in the 1990s, a nuclear weapons lab develops advanced technologies for its post-Cold War mission. Advanced as in *not working yet*. Mission as in *continued funding*. A scandal-plagued missile defense program presses forward, dragging physicist Philip Quine deep into the machinations of those who would use the lab for their own gain.
>
> The Soviet Union has collapsed. But new enemies are sought, and new reasons found to continue the work that has legitimized the power of the Lab, its managers, and the politicians who fund them. Quine is thrust into the center of programs born at the intersection of paranoia, greed, and ambition, and torn by incommensurable demands. Deadlines slip and cost overruns mount. He is drawn into a maelstrom of policy meetings, classified documents, petty betrayals, interrupted conversations, missed meanings, unanswered voicemail, stolen data, and pornographic files. Amid all the noise and static of the late twentieth century made manifest in weapons and anti-weapons, human beings have set in motion a malign and inhuman reality, which now is beyond their control.
>
> More than a critique of corrupt science and a permanent wartime economy, _Radiance_ is a novel of lost ideals, broken aspirations, and human costs. In this vivid satire, relationships are just a question of who's using whom. Failure is just another word for opportunity. "Spin" is a property not of atomic particles but of the news cycle. Nature is a blur beyond the windshield, where lives are spent on the road, on the phone, on the make, in fierce competition for financial, political, and intellectual resources. It is a world which language is used to evade, manipulate, and expedite. It is a world where everyone's story is always open to revision and language is used for justifying everything from defense programs to divorce.

[pg3] Quine approached the [Lab](!Wikipedia "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory") on a road that led nowhere else. The morning light was thick, almost a substance. Past the razorwire of the perimeter fence, cranes and water towers and incinerator stacks rose above the fortress city's sprawl of buildings. Construction vehicles moved on its roads. Beyond, grassland stretched to hillsides sallow from drought and spotted with dark stands of live oaks.

Soon he saw the protesters blocking the gate. Cars in both lanes had stopped. The blue lights and red lights of patrol cars flickered on the road's shoulders. Blackclad police formed a line between the protesters and the gate. Over chanting, rhythmic but unintelligible, rang a bullhorn's clipped commands, and the protesters moved off the roadway, the rhythm of their chant stumbling. A few remained kneeling in the road before the gate. Three police holstered their batons and moved respectfully among the kneeling protesters, like acolytes among devouts, helping them one by one to their feet and leading them within the gates to a waiting bus. The sequence of blockade, arrest, and release was by now ritual. The arrested chatted with their captors.

As the cars edged forward, Quine saw once again the darkhaired young woman in the crowd and once again felt the hollowing of his heart. Her resemblance to Kate, any reminder of Kate, still lanced him.

Two cars ahead, Leo Highet's red convertible sounded its horn as Highet leaned out to heckle, --Get a life! The woman flinched and Quine's eyes locked on Highet's head, the bald spot, the wedge of features [pg4] visible in the rearview mirror, the broad nose and dark glasses. Once through the gate Highet's car sped into a right turn to the administration building while Quine drove on to the second checkpoint, then through a desert of broken rock, buried mines, and motion sensors erect on metal stalks like unliving plants. Past this dry moat he stopped at a third checkpoint, then parked in the shade of a concrete building with blank walls and embrasured windows, and nervously thumbed the car radio, --affic and weather togeth, while he watched two younger scientists cross the lot and enter the building. Then he stilled the car and went in.

<!-- TODO -->

In his office, one horizontal window too high to reach framed an oblong of sky. On the walls, abandoned by the prior occupant and by Quine untouched, hung graphs and pictures, seismographs of bomb tests, the branched coils of particle decay, a geological map, electron micrographs of molecular etchings, a fractal mountainscape, all overlaid by memos, monthly construction maps, field test schedules, Everyone Needs To Know About Classification, cartoons, Curiosity Is Not A Need To Know, whiteboard thick with equations in four colors so long unwiped that Quine's one pass with a wet rag had left the symbols down one edge ghosted but not erased, and a second desk, loose papers cascaded across its surface, the computer monitor topped by a seamsplit cardboard carton BERINGER GREY RIESLING and buttressed by books manuals folders xeroxes Autoregressive Modeling, Rings Fields and Groups, Leonardo da Vinci Notebooks, Numerical Solution of Differential Equations, Selling Yourself and Your Ideas! and under the desk banker's boxes DESTROY AFTER, and D NULL in black marker. [Devon Null](!Wikipedia "/dev/null")^[Null presumably fits the role of [George Chapline, Jr.](!Wikipedia), inventor of the concept of nuclear-bomb-powered X-ray lasers from metal rods.], the prior occupant, was "on indefinite leave". But when Quine had moved in, Highet had insisted that he leave Null's half of the office untouched, either against Null's return or, as Quine was coming to believe, as a monument to disappearance.

Quine checked his computer mail. Most of the messages were notices, chaffing, power plays, trivia.

> ---- "To apply and direct this vast new potential of destructive energy excited the inventive genius of [Leonardo](!Wikipedia "Leonardo da Vinci") as had few other enterprises." ----

More galling than the message was Highet's new computer login _sforza_ and his signature quote. The inspirational conceit, that they were all Renaissance maestri under the gentle patronage of Prince Leo the High, had come ironically from Quine, who was reading about da Vinci's eighteen years as [military engineer](!Wikipedia) under [Ludovico Sforza](!Wikipedia), [Duke of Milan](!Wikipedia). Leonardo had written, "I hate war, as all rational men hate it, but there seems no escape from its bestial madness." Not while men of genius bend their talents to it, Quine had added. Here was Highet's comeback.

Highet. What a piece of work. Builder and destroyer of his own legend. A fecund theorist but a distracted experimenter, an indifferent administrator but a champion politician. From the start of his career he had traveled to the capital, made himself known to congressmen an their staffs. In reward for such attentions he was at a young age appointed technical representative to a disarmament conference. His conduct was impeccable until one afternoon, goaded by the other side's mendacious presentation and by his own ungovernable need to command the center of every situation, he let slip classified data.

Highet made allies sooner than friends, and enemies sooner than either. After this gaffe his allies were silent while his enemies pounced. [pg6] But Highet made the first of the hairsbreadth escapes on which his legend was built. A paper published a year before, cosigned by the President's science advisor, had exposed the same secret. The hearings were dropped and Highet was exiled to an underfunded oubliette of the Lab housed in temporary trailers: J Section.

Anyone else would have languished there. But Highet built by inches a power base, using his charisma to attract the brightest, most driven graduate students he could find, forming in the meantime new political alliances. When Congress at last funded Radiance, all the necessary talent was in J Section, and fiercely loyal to Highet. Soon he was associate director. Two years later, the director retired and Highet filled his place.

J Section. Research And Development In Advanced Nuclear Concepts. Concepts as in weapons. Advanced as in not working yet. Radiance's charter was to develop energy weapons of all types, but Highet's hope and pet was the [Superbright](!Wikipedia "Project Excalibur"): an [orbiting battle station of hairthin rods webbed around a nuclear bomb](!Wikipedia "Strategic Defense Initiative#X-ray laser"). The bomb's ignition would charge the rods with energy, focused into beams that would flash out to strike down enemy missiles, all in the microsecond before the station consumed itself in nuclear fire.

<!-- TODO: Slater is the assistant director who resigned in real life -->

So far the beams flashed out only in theory. The theory, originated by Null, seemed to Quine sound, but the more he studied his computer model, the less he understood why any of Null's tests had ever produced the ghost of a beam. Yet the farther tests fell behind expectations, the more strident became Highet's public claims. Warren Slater, in charge of testing, had resigned in protest. His letter of resignation was classified and squelched. Bernd Dietz was given interim charge of testing, and to Quine fell the task of finding in disappointing test data any optimism about the promised results.

<!-- TODO -->

Meanwhile Highet had grown ever more reckless. He began showing up at high profile conferences and seminars in subjects outside his field: on neural nets, genetic programming, nanotechnology, virtual reality, cold fusion, artificial life, making no discrimination between the cutting edge, the speculative, and the snake oil, as if the force of his character could remake physical law, or at least the local version of it. He spoke in banquet halls at Red Lion Inns, he passed out abstracts, [pg7] offprints, videotapes, he painted futures brighter and more definite than the present, with himself and his visions at the center of them, inviting the wise and the bold to sit with him in the prosperity and rectitude of that inner circle, outside which was darkness, barbarism, and chaos.

*And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude*. Again the voice. In the mind's shadows were countless voices, dead, living, unborn, lost. Since working on Radiance Quine had dreamed them. Now they came into his waking life. This voice he recognized from Leonardo's notebooks.

On his second computer, secure in steel shielding, waited Quine's simulation of the rods. This frail superstructure of hope was raised on a sprawling foundation of faith. Hundreds of man-years of Lab effort and ingenuity had gone into the underlying physics codes [programs]. Even so, it was not possible that they could describe the full complexity of a nuclear blast. Simplifications and estimates entered in, acceptable only because their results matched experimental data to some more or less arbitrary tolerance. Radiation transport, magnetic fields, burn products, photon scattering, thermal conduction, ion viscosity, [bremsstrahlung](!Wikipedia),, all these imponderables had to be calculated and updated, interacting in every kernel of space, at every nanosecond. If Quine had once puzzled for years over the paradox of a single photon, the complexities here were literally unthinkable. The reward of deep understanding was not part of the package.

None of this cauldron of approximation, this vast rationalization, this ingenuous mimickry, was Quine's responsibility. To him it was a [black box](!Wikipedia). His laser simulation ran on top of it all, passing it data, receiving its judgments. Again he ignited his bomb and waited for the nuclear pinball of particles and energies to reach his rods. Color bars and line graphs crept across the screen, the visible satisfactions of programming. The solipsistic machine worlds. It was near to pornography, without nuance. Any halfbright notion could be simulated, the simulation tweaked to an approximation of success, and the success conjured as proof for more funding. Tweak and squeak, as Highet put it. Realization was a "materials" problem. Bend your backs, men, to prove this golden turd of an idea. [pg8]

The display glitched and broke into the [debugger](!Wikipedia). Lines of [code](!Wikipedia "C (programming language)") filled the screen, `void qelem`, [`malloc(xarray)`](!Wikipedia "malloc"), `atof(nptr)`. He ceased to see words or even letters, his eyes grasping instead at the pixels, the shards of light within the characters. That radiance within the meanest mote of being.

What is light? Surfaces boil with quantum fire. How comes this dumb swarming to write beauty, alarm, or desolation upon the soul? Eyes are the questing front of the brain, the channel to the heart. The eye may not, as [Archytas](!Wikipedia) thought, emit illuminating rays, but our knowledge of its working is no surer than his.

Mind's eye and heart's channel presented him now Kate's russet hair, her full mouth and cheeks, her dimpled chin, her dark eyes framed by wire glasses. Like a key those features fit his heart. They appeared before him like a truth of nature. Mostly he lived in the mundane, scarcely noting what or whom he passed, but at rare moments the world came forward in all its vividness, stunning his heart. Every time he saw Kate, there was that shock of presence.

She was 23, he 37. They'd met in a yoga class. He hadn't pursued at first. He was coupled with Nan, a quiet woman his own age who worked at the Lab. They lived apart but spent half their spare time together. He was content and not content with what they had. But he and Kate talked, and they went out a few times. She seemed interested in him. Her eyes met something in his. Some hope had stirred in him, some need for joy so long put by he'd ceased to miss it. Thus fed his need grew, covert but unchecked. The years separating him from Kate, years he'd squandered in ever more esoteric projects at the Lab, seemed his to reclaim at will. Kate's attention fed in him some myth of starting over. He grew testy with Nan and impatient with himself, seeking not a break between them but between themselves and what he now acutely felt them becoming, burdens and reproofs to each other. Nan waited him out. Her deepening disappoint in him was unspoken but heavy. His desperation grew until he could contain it no longer and he lay it before Kate, blurted it out, a bitter plea. Save me. Who wouldn't flee from that? She regarded him kindly. Oh Philip, the moment's passed. It just didn't happen for us. There's someone else. That the moment could pass. That he had let it. Had not seen it passing. [pg9] Such a small thing, that attention, that renewed hope, briefly given and withdrawn, gone now.

The morning too was gone to no end. Every failure now he referred back to that moment, and he saw in his life only patterns of failure and emptiness.

Quine avoided that part of the building where Highet's young theorists worked, X Section, or, as the older men called it, the Playpen. But today his customary exit was blocked by a tour group of weary adults and bored children in facepaint, their guide saying, --tiny robots that actually repair human cells, as he swerved past a sign WARNING TOUR IN PROGRESS NON-CLASSIFIED CONVERSATION ONLY to the swell of the Brahms Requiem in full clash with The Butthole Surfers and a rapid din of simulated combat followed by the admiring exclamation, --Studly!

--He was one of these, shall I say, Marxist radical types. His mother cut him out of the family money. Hello, Philip. We're waiting for Leo [pg10] as usual. So he's in Prague now selling laptops to the Czechs. Ah, the man himself.

--Who's this you're talking about, sounds like he's figured out that free markets are diplomacy by other means. Everyone, this is Jef Thorpe, postdoc from the University of Utah, he's here to look us over. Jef worked with [Fish and Himmelhoch on cold fusion](!Wikipedia "Cold fusion#Fleischmann.E2.80.93Pons experiment"), and I just want to say don't believe the conventional wisdom, something is happening there^[It's worth mentioning here that one of the LLNL principals involved in Project Excalibur, [Peter L. Hagelstein](!Wikipedia), would investigate cold fusion after leaving LLNL.]. Jef, this is Dennis Kihara, our new press officer, he takes the heat for my excesses. Bernd Dietz, materials and research. Frank Szabo, systems integration. Phil Quine, our x-ray focusing guru, Philip, Jef's done interesting work in your area, you should sit down with him. Okay, all present? Let's do it.

Highet seated the young man opposite Quine. Jeans, jacket over t-shirt, short black hair, high color, a small gold stud through his left nostril, his presence a breach of protocol and probably security, though the others knew better than to say so.

--You all see the news last night? About the protest? The good news is we won. First they showed the protesters, out on the street, wind noise, bad lighting, and then our rebuttal from our respectable office. We won because we got to go last, and they put us last because we provided closure. That's the model for our presentation: beginning, middle, end. We'll begin by showing footage of successful tests. The middle will be video simulations of the system, where we'll highlight potential problems. By defining the problems we control the questions. And we'll end by addressing the problems and introducing entirely new approaches and spin-off programs. Dennis is running things, but I may break in at any point.

--Leo, can we skip the last part, the science fiction?

--No, Bernd. Past, present, future. Closure. Without this you leave people ready to ask questions.

--We're avoiding questions?

--Not if they're intelligent and informed but we have a few critics and wise guys on this panel and I'd like to keep it simple.

--Leo, I have more respect than you for the intelligence of senators. Congressmen are not always so bright but

--Bernd, it's simple courtesy. We inform them at a level that's neither [pg11] condescending nor technical, we tell them their money is being well spent, show them how, say thanks so much.

--Salesmanship.

--Grow up, Bernd, a couple times a year I ask you to do this. Is the money well spent? Yes or no.

--Yes, yes.

--I'd ah, feel better if we could discuss the middle part in ah detail, there are just some questions that I'm not comfortable to address without ah, just a little more input. For example the focusing data...

--Dennis, only Slater has questioned that data, and he's gone. Discredited. Focus is now Philip's baby.

--So, ah, focus is our main problem?

--Yes, it's one, said Quine. --Focus, brightness...

--But we're within an order of magnitude?

--I don't see any quantitative agreement with theory, said Quine. --The tests have shown a few bright spots. That's all I'm willing to commit to.

--That's all you've committed to for what is it ten months now Philip?

--I don't see any fundamentals. I'm beginning to wonder.

--Are you pulling a Slater on me, Philip? Because I want to tell you something, all of you. Some people in the lower echelons are making Slater out to be some kind of hero. To m this man was a menace to every one of us because he didn't care about winning. He didn't know what he wanted out of life and wouldn't have been able to get it if he had known. I have no respect for parasites like that.

--Leo, Null had a brilliant notion and we should pursue it, but that's all it is so far, a notion. We

--No one's questioned Null's theory, no one, not even critics.

--Sure but it's a long way from there to even a prototype

--We have supporting test data

--which may or may not mean qualitative agreement may or may not, but never quantitative, we have no understan

--well you're the one with the models Philip lo these many

--and you're the one who said this was a long term project, your words, long term, and now suddenly [pg12]

--oh sure, and if we all had seven lives

--now that there's a little pressure it's

--what I'm hearing

--it's suddenly urgent

--what I'm hearing from you Philip is that we need more shots. Convey that necessity to our guests when they're here, think you can do that? And put a little urgency into it?

--I won't pretend we have focus when

--You're not going to give me an inch are you?

--Not on the basis of spotty data I can't interpret.

--I tell you what. There's an eighty kiloton shot [bomb test] coming up next Saturday, right, Bernd? Piggyback it, Philip. Get yourself some better data.

--In what, a week? Design and fabricate apparatus in a week?

--Nine days. Jef can help you if he sticks around.

--Now hold on...

--Get off the pot. Let's move to Frank's contribution. You've all read it?

--Leo...

--We're moving on.

There was a brief silence in which papers rustled.

--Nothing new here, said Dietz.

--That's its strength. We've taken heat on preproduction technologies. This is a simple, viable off-the-shelf option. It's an easy sell. Contractors are lining up.

--It's good show-and-tell, said Szabo. --We can point to a card cage, this is the guidance system a year ago, then hold up a wafer, here it is today. Tangible progress.

Dietz continued to study the paper. --These are [Baldur](!Wikipedia "Brilliant Pebbles") [anti-satellite missiles](!Wikipedia) in a smaller package.

--That's right.

--These were shelved over ten years ago as an [ABM treaty](!Wikipedia) violation.

--That toilet paper? Let that worry us we might as well give up.

--These are not by any stretch of the imagination directed energy weapons. You want to put, what does it say, five thousand of these in orbit... [pg13]

--We're pursuing many options, Bernd. These would be one layer of a shield. Look, it's a long way to deployment. Oh and we get something else totally for free with Frank's idea. Always think [dual use](!Wikipedia). Put a warhead on these guys they're [earth penetrators](!Wikipedia "Kinetic bombardment"), aim them downward get a thousand g impact, three k p s terminal velocity, earth-coupled chock waves to destroy hardened shelters. We have a friend in the Pentagon who's hard for that and the Beltway boys know it.

--Wait just wait you mean, this, these ah interceptors are for the presentation? But it's, we need to address the existing problems, that's what they're coming for, we can't feed them something totally new! And with this Slater thing

--Dennis, trust me, it's the best possible thing to do. As far as Slater goes, he's history, a blip, not even an incident. This visit was scheduled long before his snit. Sure we'll get closer scrutiny than we would in the average dog-and-pony but it's an opportunity. Remember NORAD's famous [false alarms and screwups](!Wikipedia "North American Aerospace Defense Command#False alarms")? They get a billion-dollar facelift out of those incidents. You up to speed ow?

--Well yes, I mean no, not on the interceptors but...

--Put Frank's paper in the kit, I'll step in during the presentation. Oh, and make sure everyone gets a souvenir.

--A, I'm sorry?

--A souvenir. What are you giving the kids for family day today?

--Ah, some laser-etched aluminum disks...

--Good. Run off half a dozen make it a dozen more etched with the Radiance logo, can you do that? And glossies of the new artist's renderings.

Highet was out the door before anyone else had left their seat. Thorpe, abandoned, stood but did not move quickly enough to follow the older man out. As the seated men studied him incuriously he blushed and exited.

The others then rose. Szabo went out singing under his breath, --It's a long way, to deployment, it's a long way, I know. In the meantime, we have employment, it's the stick that makes us go...^[This might be an allusion to the popular military song "[It's a Long Way to Tipperary](!Wikipedia)".]

At the doorway Dietz said to Quine, --It is outrageous that he should bring a boy into that meeting and criticize you this way. Easy for him to make promises, but when the promises are not so easy to [pg14] deliver we suffer for them.

--I don't think the boy knew what he was getting into.

--Tell me what you want added to this test as soon as possible. He has put our asses on the line, both of us.

--I'll send you e-mail.

--Souvenirs! He gives senators souvenirs.

---

Quine had come to the Lab at [Réti](!Wikipedia "Edward Teller")'s invitation, Réti the legend, intimate of Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, founder of the Lab. Impossible to refuse. Réti had for one semester graced Quine's university with his presence, where he'd sat on Quine's doctoral committee. Quine must have made an impression, for two years later Réti called him. I hear you are working hard on some good ideas. How would you like unlimited resources for this work? Come for the summer, work on what you will.

<!-- TODO: find the classic single-photon experiment being referenced here -->

Quine and Sorokin, a fellow postdoc, had isolated the emission of a single photon from a calcium source in order to determine whether a lone quantum displayed wave-particle complementarity. For two long years they had refined their approach, paring it to essentials, designing an experiment they might hope to realize with the school's meager resources. Elegance born of need. A slow and painful progress. At the Lab, in one month Quine was able to design and build a detector acute enough, and the experiment came off on the first try. Both tunneling and anticoincidence were evident. They had touched the central mystery. Even a single photo is both particle and wave.

Quine stayed. After that it was never a question. Not till much later did he guess that he'd been played. That Réti had his reason for waiting two years before approaching him. That by then his work was ripe for plucking, and the Lab's resources had little to do with its fruition apart from giving them the juice of it.

At the Lab his paper brought him a celebrity near to grace. Unlimited time to think. No assigned duties. And the mysteries ceased to open to him. Idle, he took up one of Highet's endless suggestions, the optics of x-ray mirrors. He welcomed the work, as though it paid some tithe of the mind to the practical. And it was a challenge, but finally it was, as the pioneers had with exact irony called their first bomb, a [pg15] ["gadget"](!Wikipedia "Trinity (nuclear test)"). Any solution, even if it laid bare principles, was beside the point if it couldn't kill missiles. So his mirrors never passed a design review. He wrote some computer codes for modeling the mirrors, and those turned out to have some peripheral application in inertial confinement fusion. The weapons work which he knew to be central to the Lab still seemed distant from him. Then Radiance geared up, and his modeling software proved flexible enough to accommodate the next idea: the bombpumped Superbright. Opportunistic as a virus, the Lab took it up. Now he was pressured. Now he was in a competitive atmosphere where the possibility of failure, of weakness, of doubt, could not be voiced even to oneself lest it undermine the resolve needed to get through each day. All the projects here were difficult, at the edge of the possible, and all the scientists worked at their limits and at the limits of their science. You could work on a problem for months only to have your work demolished in minutes in a review by your peers, your competitors, your colleagues. That was what reviews were for: to show up fatal flaws before they became expensively entrenched in a design. So ideas were hammered without mercy. It was and it wasn't personal. If the idea was good, it was yours but somehow beyond you, and if it was bad the attack was on it, not on you. Quine saw men in tears even as they went on arguing and, after it was over, thank their assailants.

Throughout this he kept silent faith with the mysteries. He would return to them when the pressures of the moment were past. Programming took only the surface of his mind; its essence he held in reserve, or so he thought. Quine came at last to understand that he did well at his assigned tasks precisely because he brought them his all. Nothing was left over.

---

When he left the building the sun was low. The air was thick with heat, and as he started the car the radio blurted --record temp, before he silenced it.

Through the gate traffic slowed. Demonstrators in costume paraded in the road. Quine edged forward through skeletons and spooks with signs and props, TECHNOLOGIES OF DEATH, a longrobed mantisheaded figure towering on stilts above the crowd, tambourines jangling, EL DIA DE LOS MUERTOS, and lab security herding the [pg16] crowd off the road. As he cleared the crowd a klaxon blared. The mantis swayed, tugging at robes snagged on the perimeter razorwire as the entrance gates slid shut, alarm lights strobing. On the inner perimeter road security vehicles appeared, racing toward the entry kiosk. Then he saw standing by his passenger window the woman who resembled Kate. She wore black spandex bicycle pants and a blue chambray shirt. She was staring at the gate. Quine hesitated, then rolled down the window.

--You want a ride out of here? They're going to start arresting people.

She looked at him, then back at the gate. On the main road Quine saw a flurry of approaching lights. City police.

--I can't wait.

Whoops blasts squeals cut the crowd noise. She saw the vehicles approaching and with something like annoyance got into Quine's car. Quine sped away shutting his window against the shriek of the passing vehicles.

--I'm Philip Quine.

--Lynn Hamlin. Did you see what happened?

When he looked at her all resemblance fell away. Same body type, same round features, but hair almost black with a russet tinge, cropped close to the neck. No glasses. Dark penetrating eyes. Tanned calves faintly downed, lithe as a huntress's. No key turned in his heart, just an echo of loss.

--The one on stilts, his costume caught on the fence. It must have set off the alarm.

--Were you there for the demo?

--No. I work there.

His ID was still clipped to his jacket. She'd been looking at it, and now she smiled, as if to confide her little subterfuge.

--What do you work on?

He turned onto a road parallel to the freeway, where earthmovers were parked in torn up lots behind emporia of sporting goods, fast food, auto parts, videotapes, computers, discount carpets. Sun flashed through the struts of a half finished retaining wall.

--Defense weapons. [pg17]

--You mean Radiance. Do you believe in it?

*And those in the anterooms of Hell demur, saying, I do not approve what goes on inside.*

--It's what I do.

--Do you know what Einstein said? That you can't simultaneously prepare for war and prevent it?

--Where can I drop you?

--Corner of Mariposa.

As they passed over the freeway, the sun struck their shadow out toward the golden eastern hills. He sensed her still looking at him, then she faced ahead.

--I like this time of day, she said. --The light.

--I don't, said Quine. --It makes me think of endings.

She said nothing to that. As the car descended into the shadow of the overpass Quine said, --We didn't hear about the protest. The organizers usually let us know.

--Maybe they're tired of playing your game.

--It's not my game. A green sign with white letters Mariposa hung over the intersection. Quine pulled to the curb by a bus stop bench placarded FAST DIVORCE BANKRUPTCY. She turned to him with sudden vehemence.

--These demonstrations won't stop, you know. You don't know how angry people are... Her voice held some doubt, whether for the anger or his belief in it, he couldn't tell.

--Then I'll probably see you again out there, he said.

--Tell me, what's the point, I mean, isn't it obviously a waste now that the cold war

--Look, and hearing the annoyance in his voice he stanched it, --I don't make policy...

--Well, that's part of the problem, isn't it. People not taking responsibility for what they do.

Pricked, he turned to her just as a bus pulled to the curb, the squeal of its brakes preempting whatever he might have meant to say. Some hurt might have remained in his eyes. She seemed abashed and held his gaze for a moment longer before reaching to unbuckle her seatbelt.

--Listen... would you have lunch with me sometime? [pg18]

She looked at him in surprise. --Lunch? Why?

--I'd just like to talk more.

--Do we have anything to say to each other?

--We could find out. His pulse thickened in his throat.

--But you're the enemy, she said.

--Me...? He caught, under her serious dark brow, a glimpse of mischief, though she didn't smile.

--Thanks for the ride.

She was out the door before he felt the protest of his heart. So even now he had not relinquished hope.

---

When he got home Nan's car was in his parking space. Most Tuesday nights she spent with Quine. He went to her place Friday nights and some weekends. But he'd worked late Tuesday, so they'd shifted it to tonight. He'd forgotten.

--Lo, she called, --In the kitchen. I picked up some tortellini at Il Fornaio and a salad, is that okay?

--Fine. As he entered she turned with a wary smile. The sight of her brought him a roil of giddiness, of memory, of guilt, of sadness. Her features were sharp and fine, her skin pale, her straight auburn hair just starting to show gray, her slight body always dressed with a style that in its impeccability read as a brave front.

--Bread's in the oven, can you get that?

He looked for an oven mitt while she talked about her day, some seniority conflict in the personnel department. Quine's patience wore. When, setting the plates down, she bent to kiss his neck, he flinched.

--What's wrong?

--Nothing. It's just Highet's going mad again. A Congressional visit's coming up, it should be routine, but he acts like the whole program's at stake.

--Is it?

--First he drops Null's work in my lap, then today he starts pimping some lunatic idea of Szabo's, and he assigns me a postdoc like, like a chaperone... and the protesters.

--What about them?

--They're getting on my nerves. [pg19]

They ate in silence for a few minutes. At last he said, --What would you think if I quit?

--Quit? Your job?

--Yes.

--But Philip, what would you do?

--Well, I don't know. I could take some time off to think about it.

--Time off? I thought that we were trying to save money...

--Save...?

--Philip, I'm not trying to pressure you, but I thought we agreed that it makes sense to look for a place together...

--I told you, Nan, I can't think about that while this project is on, I can't make big plans like that until this whole thing is, is settled.

--Well, couldn't we start looking just to see what's available, just go to a few open houses...?

--If you want. But I don't see the point if we can't afford it yet.

--The point is to plan for a future, Philip. Haven't you made any progress?

--Progress, I feel like I'm chasing my tail, there's no progress to be made!

--Please don't snap at me.

--I, I can't even discuss it with you, you don't have the clearance.

She stood and carried dishes into the kitchen. He got up to follow.

--Nan... He came up behind her and embraced her. Her hands rested on his forearms.

--What about Sunday?

--Sunday?

--We're seeing Ginny and Bill, remember? If you came early we could

--Sunday. Look, I have a deadline. I can't. I'm sorry but I just can't.

--You're working? But if you're not getting anywhere...

--Well but that's the whole problem isn't it! Meantime there are still short-term goals and meetings.

She sighed and left the kitchen. In the living room the television came on. When after a moment he entered the room he heard her in the bedroom speaking on the telephone. Remote control in hand he viewed a cool panoptic tumble of war famine catastrophe enormity [pg20] larded with a fantastic plenty of goods caressed by smiling tanned models, to pause on the logotype of Martin Marietta, --a proud supporter for twenty-five years of science programming on public television, his impulse to switch again frozen by the worn, imposing face of Aron Réti, saying thickly, --In science there is a cult of the beautiful theory. But how beautiful is reality? These beautiful theories, these elegant mathematics are not verified by experiment. Experiment shows us a mess of a universe with over a hundred basic particles and three irreconcilable forces. We would like to unify them all, just as we would like to smooth over all the political differences in the world. But experience shows, in physics and in politics, that this is not always possible.

Abruptly the screen glared with the involute radiance of the bomb. Sun's heart. Cosmic ground. [Siva](!Wikipedia "Shiva") and [Devi](!Wikipedia) coupling. A thin roar issued from the set and the thick voice rode over it, --The duty of science is to pursue knowledge even if it leads to the unbeautiful. Or to evil. How else learn about evil?

Nan returned to sit beside him. --Isn't that Réti?

The camera returned to the physicist. Emeritus director, Réti was rarely at the Lab; the office he kept there served him solely as a clubroom or a backdrop. Six months ago a film crew had come to the Lab. Quine had heard Réti shouting at them behind the closer door.

--What, this is what Highet calls the liberal bias of the media, said Quine as the camera went to the interview.

--After the war, many of your colleagues turned away from weapons. Some of them have won Nobel Prizes. Do you feel that your work with weapons has cost you [credibility or respect within the scientific community](!Wikipedia "Edward Teller#Oppenheimer controversy")? Has it compromised you as a scientist?

--Never. In fact it has challenged and improved me as a scientist.

--You're closely connected to Radiance. What about recent charges that test results have been faked?

--This is a lie! First, I am not closely connected...

--But you've lobbied extensively for Radiance in Wash

--I am no lobbyist! I am a private citizen with some scientific expertise, and when I am asked to testify about technical matters I do so... [pg21]

--But for over forty years you've been an advocate of nuclear weapons. Your authority and influence are well known.

<!-- TODO -->

--Now you listen to me. It is an imperfect world, a dangerous world. There is evil in the world. How do you meet it? All ends, even the best, are reached by impure means. Reason is supposed to be the hallmark of science, but I tell you that no one is swayed by reason. a theory, an idea, does not make its own way. It was Einstein who said merit alone is very little good; it must be backed by tact and knowledge of the world. I know of many cases where maybe the data does not quite agree with your theory, no, you think, the carpers will question, your case is far clearer if you discard this set of data, if you report only these results. And who are these frauds? Ptolemy. Galileo. Newton. Bernoulli. Mendel. Millikan. What matters in the long run is not some wishful dream of scruples, but whether you have driven your knowledge home!

Behind the fury in Reti's eyes Quine saw a bright and open wound: more illustrious for his influence than his work, he had failed at everything but success. And Quine's own life, he suddenly saw, was bent around Reti's influence. A man has no wealth nor power but his knowledge, Reti had once said to Quine. But now he said that if power did not lead, knowledge could not follow. Quine stood, ignoring --Philip? what is it? and went to the bathroom. He held the sides of the sink, heart racing. In the cabinet he found the pill bottle.

<!-- TODO -->

*The spirit is radiant, yet there are two principles of radiance: that of light, and that of fire. Fire comes to the use of those who go not the way of light. And the difference is, that fire must consume its object.*

<!-- TODO -->

Quine returned to Reti's angry voice, --So I have no Nobel Prize, that accolade of the pure. But Alfred Nobel would understand me well. And history will be my judge, not you.

-What is it, Philip? What's the matter?

Quine turned to Nan, her face in the phosphor light bleak as a rock outcrop. He reached to touch her neck. Unsmiling she leaned her head against his hand. His fingers cupped her nape and he drew her mouth to his.

In the bedroom they undressed on opposite sides of the bed. The television droned on. Between her legs he felt the string of a tampon, [pg22] and as he touched it she bent double and enclosed him in her mouth. Above the activity of their bodies his spirit hovered sadly regarding the terrain of his life. Lightly his hands cradled her head. He began to pump semen. Deep inside him a talon drove home and brought forth, impaled, his soul, writhing. A minute later he was awash in sleep. Waiting at a counter to pick up xeroxes. Quick tap at his shoulder. Kate. She smiled, her eyes upon him, and he knew it was a dream, and he was happy, and he slept. [pg23]

## Two

The morning sky, pallid with haze, conveyed yet enough sun to cast through the high embrasure of his office window a faint rhombus which crept toward the doorway relentless as a horologue. From his desk Quine gazed at it half hearing the radio, --ildfires in three counties, when his phone rang.

--Quine.

--Is this Philip?

--Yes, who's this.

--Lynn. From the demo yesterday?

--Oh. Oh yes. How did you... He stood and paced with the phone. --How did you get my number?

--I called the switchboard. I want to apologize. I behaved badly. Are you free for coffee?

--Well I... not this morning.

--Later this afternoon?

--Well I...

--Don't let me pressure you.

--No I, I want to. It's just a surprise.

--I get off work at four. Do you know the Café Desaparecidos [the missing]? In the central mall. I work near there.

--Sure I, okay, I'll see you there about four.

As he hung up Jef Thorpe knocked on his open door. Black jacket, blue shirt, jeans. A faint pock where yesterday the nose stud had been.

--Come in. [pg24]

--I guess we'll be working together.

--Oh, you're staying.

--If you'll have me. Listen, that meeting yesterday, I didn't belong there, I'm sorry if...

--Not your fault. Doctor Highet has his way of doing things.

--Yeah, I see that. Listen, before we started I want to tell you, the single-photon experiment you did with Sorokin was really elegant. I was, you know, sort of surprised to find you here, I thought you'd be somewhere more theoretical.

--I thought everyone had forgotten that experiment by now.

--Oh no. It was very sweet work.

--The detector was critical. We worked on it for two years. We got it only after I came here.

--You didn't follow it up.

--Sorokin thought I was wrong to come here. He said it would be a black hole. He may have been right. Of course things look different from inside.

--Black hole, yeah, I've thought of that. But you know where I come from. That limits my options in the straight academic world.

--You don't have qualms about defense work?

--It's not what I'm here for.

--It's just, you might want to consider your position. I came in neutral about defense work, but before long I was in the thick of it. It's easy to slip into.

--I'm sort of apolitical.

--Well, if that's what you want, turning to the computer which glowed with:

--Looks like we're real, said Thorpe.

--You're lucky. It was years before I was associated with a shot.

--Is that luck?

--It's a bit of a prestige. A merit badge.

Quine cleared the screen and brought up the Superbright test data.

--You see. Intense brightness here, and here. Very erratic pattern.

--This data is picked up how?

--When the bomb ignites, radiation from the rods bounces off some reflectors to

--X-ray mirrors?

--Yes, something like that. They're [beryllium](!Wikipedia). The data agrees with theory to a point, but when we increase power, we don't get an increase in beam, in fact we get less. We've talked about trying different metals in the rods, we've used gold till know, but mercury...

--Yeah, elements seventy-two through ninety-five would be good to try but with the, you know, time constraints, I checked and Fabrication has gold rods ready to go, so maybe those are a good choice and you can, or I mean we can sort of concentrate on sensor configuration...

--Sounds reasonable.

Thorpe continued to stare at the screen. --Could this bean [annular](!Wikipedia "Annulus (mathematics)")? This pattern I mean, could those reflectors be picking up a sort of imperfect focus, you know, the edge of a ring? If we move them in...

--I've tried, no luck.

--Can I look at your focusing code?

--Yes, sure, all the files are in this directory.

--That's great. Mind if I work here? pointing to Null's desk.

--Ah, sure. Sure, go head. I'm going for lunch and maybe a swim. I'll see you later.

Gaunt, saturnine, Bran Nolan in a corner of the cafeteria looked up unsmiling from scattered papers to raise a hand in greeting. [pg26]

--How's our new boyo Kihara?

--Weren't you in line for that position?

--It's my Tourette's syndrome. Terrible liability in a press officer, never know what he might blurt out in public.

--You should have been asked.

--Do you know, I'm happier, if that's the word I want, where I am. Kihara is a little lamb. The last man, Vessell, didn't outlast Slater. And we're not done with all that, no indeed.

--Getting some work done? Quine indicated the papers.

--"The Lab has a longstanding commitment to developing new methods and technologies to protect the environment", the most effective of which to date has been the press release. Do you know we have a toxics mitigation program now? Seems there's a toxic plume seeping into the groundwater under a vineyard off the north boundary. Vines died, soil went gray, the whole field stinks like sepsis. I'm writing an upbeat report about it. And yourself? How's the death ray coming?

--We can maim small insects at a meter. The new concept is interceptors. Small flying rocks.

--Do you know, da Vinci invented shrapnel. He'd have been right at home here with all these advanced minds.

--Yes, that's Highet's conceit.

--Throwing rocks at things. We should be proud, thinking about these old impulses in such an advanced way.

A plump figure cam forward shaking a sheaf of papers, from which Nolan recoiled. --Bran, Bran, Bran. What must I do to get you to use a font other than [Courier](!Wikipedia "Courier (typeface)")?

--Hello Bob, how's the gout? I don't like this business of tarting up manuscripts. You get enchanted by the beauty of it all. You start to think you're writing the [Book of Kells](!Wikipedia).

--A few attractive fonts, tastefully applied, can spice up a presentation. A little [humanitas](!Wikipedia), you know. Why else, Bran, did we get you that powerful and costly workstation?

--I don't know, Bob, why did you? I was still figuring out the [type balls on my Selectric](!Wikipedia "IBM Selectric typewriter").

The sheaf of papers fell fanning from their clip onto the table. [pg27]

Shaking his head and chuckling grimly, Bob passed on to another table.

<!-- TODO Elect? -->

--Humanitas, yes, that's what we need here, isn't it, Highet with his Renaissance, and [Aldus Manutius](!Wikipedia) there, need a few more particle men who've read the Tao Te Ching, couple more manages who've studied Sun Tzu, lend these binary views a little tone, dress up the winners and losers, the Elect and the Preterite, the screwers and the screwed. Each man in his station, and keep your distance from the low life, can't have just anyone winning, because if you ever let the rabble ahead, if they can rise, you can surely fall.

Nolan folded back pages, --listen to this bit, "the support of this tight-knit community", support is it now? I'd have said the goading, the ambition, the Schadenfreude, that's what gets the work done. The wife walked out six months ago with the kid, you're eating Campbell's soup cold out of the can, you haven't got a clean shirt, but after a few months of eighteen hour days you've got *data* that everyone wants to see. You *win big*.

--Bran, you work here, too.

--What should I do then, write novels? Or maybe journalism, that's it, *investigative* journalism. Have you met the journalist from Cambridge? Right over there with his tape recorder, name's [Armand Steradian](!Wikipedia "Hugh Gusterson"). He's researching the belief systems of those who work on weapons of mass destruction^[Gusterson's Lab research has been published as [_Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0520213734) & [_People Of The Bomb: Portraits of America's Nuclear Complex_](http://www.amazon.com/People-Of-The-Bomb-Portraits/dp/0816638608).], I think that was his phrase. Quite the charmer. He's published one book on scientific fraud, and a paper highly critical of what he calls the defense establishment. You probably don't watch TV but there was a program on PBS last night, Steradian was in it abusing Reti.

--Does Highet know he's here?

--Highet invited him.[^Gusterson-access]

[^Gusterson-access]: In a [2002 interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/science/a-conversation-with-hugh-gusterson-finding-rich-fodder-in-nuclear-scientists.html?pagewanted=all "A CONVERSATION WITH/Hugh Gusterson; Finding Rich Fodder In Nuclear Scientists"), Gusterson portrays it more informally:

    > There was an undergraduate in my department whose father worked at Livermore. My adviser said, "Why don't you drive down there and see so-and-so's father?" So I drove there one evening...This man led me to other people in the lab. Thereafter, whenever I interviewed someone, I'd ask my subject to refer me to others. I also began a program of "deep hanging out." I moved to the town of Livermore. My roommates often worked at the lab. I went to local churches, to bars, to the singles group. I ate lunch at the lab's cafeteria.

Quine headed for the door, passing as he did Armand Steradian, who held a small microphone before a J Section technician, --you're so goldang busy every day you just put off thinking about it, though in Quine's view pressure was a tool well used to put off thinking.

Black cottonwoods around the pool throve despite the drought. Their catkins littered the water. A jet moved on the sky, stitching a contrail [pg28] across a lace of cloud where a white sun struggled. Quine sat on a towel on the grassy verge and watched a portly swimsuited man enter through the gate, barrel chest glossed with hair, and behind him a woman in a white halter top and shorts, the heads of three men turning to follow. The pool was crowded this Friday afternoon; it was warm, it was the end of the workweek, it was family day; unlike Quine, most worked a five day week, most would depart hence into a forgetfulness. In the shallows of the pool two young girls splashed. One opened her mouth to show her companion a bright penny on her outstretched tongue. A young mother in a black maillot gripped a ladder to raise herself half from the pool and wave at her infant in a nearby stroller, glisten and shadow in the cords of her back, and Quine suffered a pang for a life now beyond his knowing: to be wed, with child, so young. On thermals a black and white winged vulture, _[Cathartes aura](!Wikipedia)_, rocked and banked. From the jet thunder fell like muffled blows. The warmth and the sound of water churned by swimmers and the spray tossed up by their passing lulled Quine into a lethargy from which he woke with a start to consult his watch. On the pool's floor danced cusps of light.

The café's walls rose past exposed beams and ducts to the nacre of frosted skylights. Lynn sat in a wirebacked chair at a glass table, face downcast at papers before her. In the moment before she looked up, Kate's face glowed before him. What do you do, Philip?

--Hoy es el [día de los muertos](!Wikipedia), Lynn said in greeting, banishing Kate's image. Angularities all her own moved in her flesh; a small gap showed between her teeth as she smiled.

Quine seated himself and said gravely, --I should tell you I'm involved with someone.

--Gee, I said I wanted to apologize, not start an affair.

--I, sorry I...

--And maybe pick your brain about Radiance.

--I'm sorry, I, what did you say before? El día...

--Today is the Day of the Dead. All Saint's Day. All of California used to be Mexico, you know, they called it [Aztlan](!Wikipedia "Aztlán#Use by the Chicano movement"). Once my group shuts the Lab down, we're going to reclaim Aztlan for the native peoples [pg29]. Oh, don't look that way, I'm joking, that's the kind of thing the far right says about us.

--Your group?

--Citizens Against Nuclear Technology^[Possibly the [Livermore Action Group](!Wikipedia "Anti-nuclear protests in the United States#Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory")]. I'm a paralegal with them.

--What's that your reading?

--Your press releases. She held a sheaf set in unadorned Courier font. --You people have fingers in a lot of pies. When I started my concern was the bombs, but that's just the tip of the iceberg, isn't it. There's also the supercomputers, the lasers, the genetics, the chemicals...

--You probably know more about it than I do.

--Your cover stories are so creative. Every one of. Oh, go ahead, order, she's waiting.

--Cappuccino. What do you mean, cover stories?

--Quisiera un espresso por favor. Every one of these quote benign technologies has a pretty easy to imagine military use. Laser x-ray lithography for etching microchips, uh huh, right, and here's one about kinder gentler [C](!Wikipedia "Chemical warfare")[B](!Wikipedia "Biological warfare")W, "less virulent" tear gas for "crowd control", heavier [specific gravity](!Wikipedia) for controlled delivery, if this is the stuff you're public about I can only imagine the rest.

--You're wrong, there's a genuine effort to convert to peacef

--Dual use, I know. Genuine effort to blur the line is what it is, and it goes far beyond the Lab, people in physics and comp sci departments across the country are lining up at the same trough, the grants are there and if they don't take the money someone else will. That's the reasoning. What a waste of talent and resources.

--It's more complicated than that. The people I work with, they're not cynical.

--Yes, I know how people get caught up in their work. I have a friend there, not in Radiance, in another section. He's a Quaker, he calls it "being in the world". At least he's thought about it. How did you get into it?

--Me? I'm, well, a lapsed theorist. But I'm not typical... Was he not? Reti, Highet, Dietz, Thorpe, all had failed in some subtle way that in such a place could be denied. But where was there not failure and denial?

--Do your people pay any attention at all to our demonstrations? [pg30]

--In J Section? Not much.

--We seem to bug your boss, at least.

--Highet?

--In his little red sports car. What about you? What did you think about the big one yesterday?

--It seemed, I don't know, festive, almost a costume party, I didn't realize at first it was Halloween...

--But no, that wasn't it. It was a ceremony. An exorcism.

--Oh come on, what, you mean we're possessed...

--By arrogance, if nothing else.

--That's absurd, you can't convince anyone with some absurd ritual...

--It's no different from your rituals, your bomb tests, just as absurd, but really dangerous!

--They're not my tests... and he remembered _B. Dietz & P. Quine, sup._ --I'm sorry. I'm no good at talking about this.

The set of her features, so poised and eager, softened then and her voice lowered. --I don't mean to attack you. I'm sure you think about it.

--Yes but, but I'm not sure! What to do, I mean. What if it is a waste, what if, if all the money and the decades, all the lives and talent... then it's more than just me, it's not just my mistake, but something wrong at the root of it, and what, what can I do about that?

--If it is a mistake, you can face it. You could stop.

--But that wouldn't stop anything. It's almost as if these things we work on... they use us to get born. Could use anyone.

--It must be very hard for you. Their eyes met, and the troubled sympathy in hers wrung him. Her face was so concerned for him that he almost cried out with selfpity.

--It's not your fault. I, I need to get back now.

--I really am sorry, can we... can we forget about all this and just start over?

--Start over...?

Abruptly he rose and walked away stolid with loathing of his own erratic heart, and of her for stirring it.

[pg31] In the night he work sweating with a pulse of ninety, reached for the pillbottle next to the small box [DREAMLIGHT](!Wikipedia "Stephen_LaBerge#Lucid dreaming education and facilitation") Unlock Your Inner Potential and its plastic headset. The pills opened a plain of timelessness in which it seemed a lost part of himself dwelled. as he lay in their haze, his fluency returned. Wonderful problems enticed and yielded to his insight, wisdom depended from the sky like fruit. He kept a notebook in case any insight survived his waking. None did.

He attached the headset like a blindfold. At the onset of dreaming a strobe would flicker there and rouse him enough to [observe and direct his dream but not to wake](!Wikipedia "Lucid dream"). He settled and conjured an image: the battle station shining in the void of space. Slender arms and rods pivoting. The missile rise in swarms, bright points on the black hollow of a crescent Earth. They blur in a silver mist of chaff. Above the crescent distant battle stations ignite in globes of light, their beams lance out, but swarm follows swarm up from the Earth, far too many to destroy. He pulled off the headset.

The world has changed, the old enemy has collapsed into ruined republics. Yet despite this consummation of all the Lab has strived for, the work goes on, the mood is spiritless, the shots in the desert continue like some ritual of penance, some black and endless propitiation of forces that in losing their fixed abode have grown closer and more menacing.

Stillness. Faint whistle of tinnitus, first sounds of birdcall. Wan dawn light. The enemy is gone. But the work goes on and on.
