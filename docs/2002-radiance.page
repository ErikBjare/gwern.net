<!-- TODO: when done, schedule an email interview / series of questions for Scholz:
why so little about Los Alamos?
why transpose the Project Excalibur scandal from Reagan-era to Clinton-era?
and not coverage the existential threat of a full test ban, and the grand bargain struck for the supercomputers & lasers to replace testing? from McNamara pg241:

"Given the high level of political interest in test restrictions at the end of the 1980s, I was surprised to realize that the 1992 test moratorium caught many staff members off guard. When I asked one physicist to explain why the test moratorium was such a surprise, he replied, "Denial." Another retired designer, a former director in X Division, told me,
'The folklore in the late 1980s was, "We don't talk about test bans." We don't let anybody know that we may be getting ready for a test ban. Because if you do, that will almost certainly result in a test ban. In retrospect, that was exactly the wrong attitude.'
Yet this kind of attitude does explain why the test moratorium came as a demoralizing shock to many weapons experts, many of whom were just beginning to grapple with the implications of the Cold War's end for the laboratory's mission.
Denial, however, is only part of the story. Several of the weapons experts I met readily acknowledged that they were aware of an imminent end to testing, and were concerned about maintaining the laboratory's knowledge base under a test ban, yet few weapons experts made significant efforts to "capture" weapons related knowledge for "preservation" in the event of a test moratorium."

do any research on the ground at LLNL?
reaction to reception - or reception at nuke labs? lots of SF fans there
overall take on science/technology: purely negative or more mixed?

# Background

Many comments and bits of history relevant to _Radiance_ can found in Gusterson's anthropological works on the nuclear bomb designers, eg. ["A Pedagogy of Diminishing Returns: Scientific Involution across Three Generations of Nuclear Weapons Science"](/docs/2005-gusterson.pdf), Gusterson 2005:

> The 1970s and the 1980s, when nuclear testing moved [underground](!Wikipedia "Underground nuclear testing"), were a period of routinization: the institutional apparatus for nuclear weapons design and testing grew, its scientific achievements shrank, and the arteries of the weapons design bureaucracy hardened. Attempts to perfect a third-generation nuclear weapon-the x-ray laser-failed and were abandoned in an atmosphere of scandal and disgrace.^11^ The art of weapons design progressed, but by increments rather than great leaps: weapons designers learned to squeeze greater yields out of smaller quantities of plutonium so that nuclear weapons could be made lighter and smaller, weapons were made safer through the addition of [Permissive Action Links](!Wikipedia) (PALS) and the substitution of [Insensitive High Explosive](!Wikipedia) (IHE) for conventional explosives,^12^ and the supercomputer codes used to model the behavior of nuclear weapons were gradually refined. The names of the men (and now women) behind these achievements are largely unknown outside the nuclear weapons bureaucracy, and in some cases their achievements are only partially known within the weapons laboratories, thanks to the compartmentalizing effects of official secrecy in the weapons complex.^13^ Nuclear tests were forbidden after the end of the Cold War, and the practice and pedagogy of nuclear weapons science shifted again. Forced to largely abandon their nuclear test site in Nevada - a place where the desert sands encroach on the old bowling alley and cinema, now disused, as tourist buses disgorge camera-laden voyeurs to gawk at the nuclear craters - many of the old-timers elected to retire.

> - 32: Donald MacKenzie and Graham Spinardi ("Tacit knowledge," 59) make a similar point, though with a slightly different periodization, saying that "by the 1980s designing nuclear weapons had lost much of its flavor of virtuoso innovation and had become a more routine task: one, indeed, that some in the laboratories feel to have become bureaucratized, unchallenging, even 'dull.'"
>
> ...Also, since two-thirds of the weapons entering the stockpile through the late 1950s were Los Alamos weapons, [Livermore could afford to do speculative and exploratory design work](!Wikipedia "Nuclear weapon design#Livermore"), while Los Alamos was forced to devote its resources to validation of actual designs. In its preference for more ambitious and exploratory design work the Livermore Laboratory was not only responding to the structural exigencies of its relationship with Los Alamos; it was also expressing the persona of its other distinguished founding scientist, Edward Teller. Thus, while Los Alamos developed a conservative approach to weapons design, "the new laboratory worked on 'bolder' designs, less certain of success than those of Los Alamos."^36^ Francis argued that Los Alamos, "more experienced, and with established ties to the military . . . gained responsibility for the highest priority and most urgent military requirements. Livermore found opportunities in nuclear systems that were more speculative, that did not yet have formal JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] authorization, or were low priority."^37^ Thus, after a rocky start in which the "new ideas" laboratory's first three nuclear tests were "fizzles" (the weapons designers' term for low-yield duds), Livermore consistently pushed the envelope of nuclear weapons design in a way that Los Alamos did not. It was Livermore that shrunk the diameter of fission weapons enough to make the low-diameter [Davy Crockett artillery shell](!Wikipedia "Davy Crockett (nuclear device)") for the army in the 1950s.^38^ It was Livermore that pushed yield-to-weight ratios and shrunk a hydrogen bomb enough to produce the [first hydrogen bomb warhead](!Wikipedia "W47") for a strategic missile - the Polaris system - after Los Alamos scientists had scoffed at the Livermore proposal.^39^ It was Livermore that designed the first [MIRV](!Wikipedia) warhead. It was Livermore that introduced the first two-dimensional computer code in the mid 1950s^[See pg132-133 of Francis 1995; this apparently means literally that (contrary to my initial assumption that 1-d simulations would be useless and so the phrase must refer to something like writing in [assembly language](!Wikipedia) rather than, say, [Fortran](!Wikipedia) which was also developed in the mid-1950s) - the early nuclear simulations were done of _n_ atoms or molecules arranged on a 1-dimensional line, and only as Moore's law continued in the 1950s, were they able to do somewhat more realistic simulations of _n_x_n_ particles in planes. McNamara comments in 2001 that "Towards the end of the Cold War, design physicists were beginning to develop three-dimensional models as well, although the laboratory only recently ran a full 3D simulation of a design problem. Completing the model required over six weeks of time on the laboratory's massive computers, which are currently among the fastest and most powerful machines in the world (Fleck 2000)."]. And it was Livermore that conducted the [first [fully-contained] underground nuclear test](!Wikipedia "Operation Plumbbob") in 1957, in the face of opposition from Los Alamos.^40^

Los Alamos was concerned that underground testing would be too expensive and difficult to instrument, and that proof of the possibility of underground testing would make it more likely that the U.S. government would agree to a treaty banning atmospheric testing.
>
> But there was a dark side to Livermore's organizational culture of risk and creativity. Livermore's institutionalized propensity to cut corners and push forward with poorly understood design approaches led to periodic failures, even scandals, of a kind unknown at Los Alamos. Livermore's first two tests, which failed to even vaporize the towers from which the bombs were suspended, made the new laboratory the butt of jokes in Los Alamos, whose scientists eagerly photographed the still-standing towers.^41^ Meanwhile, during the test moratorium, Livermore rushed Polaris warheads into the stockpile despite a poorly tested mechanical safing system that, it was subsequently discovered, turned many of the warheads into duds.^42^ This risk-taking culture, essential to the younger laboratory's organizational persona, was to endure: in the 1980s Livermore scientists' optimistic and mistaken assurances that the x-ray laser - a critical component of President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative - was ready for the engineering phase would create a public relations disaster for the Laboratory when the weapon was finally cancelled amidst revelations that it never really worked and that the Associate Director for Weapons Design [Roy Woodruff] had secretly resigned in protest against his colleagues' representations of the weapon to the White House.^43^ And in the 1990s Livermore's Associate Director for Lasers would resign after public revelations of cost overruns and wildly over-optimistic performance projections by Livermore's management regarding its huge new laser project: the [National Ignition Facility](!Wikipedia) (NIF).^44^

UCRL-53820). The last round of tests before the 1958 moratorium had established that one of the Livermore Polaris designs was not inherently [one-point safe](!Wikipedia "Nuclear weapon design#Warhead design safety"): in other words, an accidental nuclear detonation of the weapon was possible if, for example, it was struck by a bullet. Rather than replace the Livermore primary in the weapon with a Los Alamos primary, Teller, Livermore's director at the time, elected to use a mechanical safing mechanism.

The ostensible reason for the resignation of Mike Campbell, Associate Director for lasers, was the public revelation that he had claimed to have a doctorate from Princeton despite never having finished his PhD thesis, but most observers agreed that the timing of this revelation was tied to the increasingly evident financial and organizational problems of the National Ignition Facility, a project directed by Campbell.
>
> At the end of the Cold War, a Livermore weapons designer said to me, only half joking, "The Soviets are the competition, but Los Alamos is the enemy." The fierce rivalry between the two weapons laboratories encouraged each, in the complex competition for contracts from the Atomic Energy Commission and the three armed services, to develop partly opposed institutional personae: Los Alamos as a conservative organization of good pedigree making carefully understood incremental design changes as it developed higher and higher yield hydrogen bombs for air force bombers and improved tactical weapons for the army, Livermore as a bolder organization using riskier design ideas Los Alamos had shelved in order to miniaturize nuclear weapons for the navy and the army. The divergence of design cultures at the two laboratories was also a legacy of the approach to physics as craft of the charismatic scientists who established the research orientations of the two laboratories at the outset: Oppenheimer and Bethe, both theorists, at Los Alamos; Lawrence, an experimentalist, and Teller, a dreamer, at Livermore.

> ...One designer who joined the Livermore Laboratory in the early 1960s, only to quit in the 1970s out of, he says, boredom, remarked of a highly respected designer at Livermore: "He's spent his whole life designing the same bomb over and over again, shaving a few centimeters off here and there but never doing anything fundamentally new. It only seems like exciting physics because it's so secret."^52^

> ...New designers were encouraged to maintain broad interests and even to publish in the open literature as they were learning their corner of the art of weapons design. This was partly to ensure that young physicists - accustomed to the university environments where they did their graduate work and unsure if weapons design would hold their interest over the long run - did not become too disaffected from their new specialization and instead focused on the extraordinary opportunities offered by employment at a laboratory with the fastest supercomputers and the largest community of physicists in the country. The same designer quoted above recalled:
>
>> Once you step inside the gates [of the laboratory] it's a very open and university-like atmosphere. It's the closest that I've come to that kind of atmosphere outside a university. The Laboratory has tremendous resources to do work that would not be possible academically. Even now, I still believe that it's possible for someone to come up with an idea and do some interesting work, even if it's not related to the weapons program. They may not get a lot of recognition for it, but there is the possibility.^55^

>> We like people to keep publishing. When we bring people in, we tell them that: we'll give you a certain percentage of your time, and we want you to keep to that because we want you to interact with people outside the lab. I have continued to publish - not a lot, but I have a colleague who works with me, and over the years we've published quite a few papers. It's low key, but I have an international reputation from that work. It's not my number one priority in life, but. . . .^56^

> ...Some weapons designers have argued that, if only nuclear testing were to resume, then a renaissance of nuclear weapons science would ensue. The reality seems to me, however, to be more complicated. After the weapons scientists' failure in the 1980s to perfect third-generation nuclear weapons, weapons scientists largely stopped talking about major new breakthroughs in their art. In the 1990s those who argued for further nuclear testing did not argue that major advances in nuclear weapons science would be possible. (Indeed it was the turn to simulations forced by the end of nuclear testing that produced the boldest innovations in the practice, and the rhetoric, of nuclear weapons science.) Instead those who opposed the end of testing argued that continued testing was necessary to ensure the reliability of old weapons as they decayed or, if they did refer to new weapons, made modest claims: they suggested that it would be possible to develop a bunker-busting mini-nuke or a sort of Maytag nuclear weapon-what designers call a "wooden bomb"-optimized to age well in the absence of testing in the future. In other words, even without the nuclear test ban, nuclear weapons science had by the end of the Cold War hit a sort of wall. It is not that weapons scientists had no ideas for improving their weapons - the reverse was true - but the refinements had become so incremental and the ratio of effort and expense to scientific advancement in the performance of nuclear testing had shifted so far that nuclear weapons science was becoming like, say, Gothic architecture at the end of the nineteenth century: an increasingly repetitious and involuted practice that was losing its energizing edge and its appeal to the best and the brightest. The Oppenheimers and Tellers had given way to smart career physicists who saw themselves largely as custodians of a settled body of knowledge

## Jacket copy

> Somewhere in California, in the 1990s, a nuclear weapons lab develops advanced technologies for its post-Cold War mission. Advanced as in *not working yet*. Mission as in *continued funding*. A scandal-plagued missile defense program presses forward, dragging physicist Philip Quine deep into the machinations of those who would use the lab for their own gain.
>
> The Soviet Union has collapsed. But new enemies are sought, and new reasons found to continue the work that has legitimized the power of the Lab, its managers, and the politicians who fund them. Quine is thrust into the center of programs born at the intersection of paranoia, greed, and ambition, and torn by incommensurable demands. Deadlines slip and cost overruns mount. He is drawn into a maelstrom of policy meetings, classified documents, petty betrayals, interrupted conversations, missed meanings, unanswered voicemail, stolen data, and pornographic files. Amid all the noise and static of the late twentieth century made manifest in weapons and anti-weapons, human beings have set in motion a malign and inhuman reality, which now is beyond their control.
>
> More than a critique of corrupt science and a permanent wartime economy, _Radiance_ is a novel of lost ideals, broken aspirations, and human costs. In this vivid satire, relationships are just a question of who's using whom. Failure is just another word for opportunity. "Spin" is a property not of atomic particles but of the news cycle. Nature is a blur beyond the windshield, where lives are spent on the road, on the phone, on the make, in fierce competition for financial, political, and intellectual resources. It is a world which language is used to evade, manipulate, and expedite. It is a world where everyone's story is always open to revision and language is used for justifying everything from defense programs to divorce.

[pg3] Quine approached the [Lab](!Wikipedia "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory") on a road that led nowhere else. The morning light was thick, almost a substance. Past the razorwire of the perimeter fence, cranes and water towers and incinerator stacks rose above the fortress city's sprawl of buildings. Construction vehicles moved on its roads. Beyond, grassland stretched to hillsides sallow from drought and spotted with dark stands of live oaks.

Soon he saw the protesters blocking the gate. Cars in both lanes had stopped. The blue lights and red lights of patrol cars flickered on the road's shoulders. Blackclad police formed a line between the protesters and the gate. Over chanting, rhythmic but unintelligible, rang a bullhorn's clipped commands, and the protesters moved off the roadway, the rhythm of their chant stumbling. A few remained kneeling in the road before the gate. Three police holstered their batons and moved respectfully among the kneeling protesters, like acolytes among devouts, helping them one by one to their feet and leading them within the gates to a waiting bus. The sequence of blockade, arrest, and release was by now ritual. The arrested chatted with their captors.

As the cars edged forward, Quine saw once again the darkhaired young woman in the crowd and once again felt the hollowing of his heart. Her resemblance to Kate, any reminder of Kate, still lanced him.

Two cars ahead, Leo Highet's^[Highet is based partially on [Lowell Wood](!Wikipedia).] red convertible sounded its horn as Highet leaned out to heckle, --Get a life! The woman flinched and Quine's eyes locked on Highet's head, the bald spot, the wedge of features [pg4] visible in the rearview mirror, the broad nose and dark glasses. Once through the gate Highet's car sped into a right turn to the administration building while Quine drove on to the second checkpoint, then through a desert of broken rock, buried mines, and motion sensors erect on metal stalks like unliving plants. Past this dry moat he stopped at a third checkpoint, then parked in the shade of a concrete building with blank walls and embrasured windows, and nervously thumbed the car radio, --affic and weather togeth, while he watched two younger scientists cross the lot and enter the building. Then he stilled the car and went in.

<!-- TODO -->

In his office, one horizontal window too high to reach framed an oblong of sky. On the walls, abandoned by the prior occupant and by Quine untouched, hung graphs and pictures, seismographs of bomb tests, the branched coils of particle decay, a geological map, electron micrographs of molecular etchings, a fractal mountainscape, all overlaid by memos, monthly construction maps, field test schedules, Everyone Needs To Know About Classification, cartoons, Curiosity Is Not A Need To Know, whiteboard thick with equations in four colors so long unwiped that Quine's one pass with a wet rag had left the symbols down one edge ghosted but not erased, and a second desk, loose papers cascaded across its surface, the computer monitor topped by a seamsplit cardboard carton BERINGER GREY RIESLING and buttressed by books manuals folders xeroxes Autoregressive Modeling, Rings Fields and Groups, Leonardo da Vinci Notebooks, Numerical Solution of Differential Equations, Selling Yourself and Your Ideas! and under the desk banker's boxes DESTROY AFTER, and D NULL in black marker. [Devon Null](!Wikipedia "/dev/null")^[Null presumably fits the role of [George Chapline, Jr.](!Wikipedia), inventor of the concept of nuclear-bomb-powered X-ray lasers from metal rods.], the prior occupant, was "on indefinite leave". But when Quine had moved in, Highet had insisted that he leave Null's half of the office untouched, either against Null's return or, as Quine was coming to believe, as a monument to disappearance.

Quine checked his computer mail. Most of the messages were notices, chaffing, power plays, trivia.

> ---- "To apply and direct this vast new potential of destructive energy excited the inventive genius of [Leonardo](!Wikipedia "Leonardo da Vinci") as had few other enterprises." ----

More galling than the message was Highet's new computer login _sforza_ and his signature quote. The inspirational conceit, that they were all Renaissance maestri under the gentle patronage of Prince Leo the High, had come ironically from Quine, who was reading about da Vinci's eighteen years as [military engineer](!Wikipedia) under [Ludovico Sforza](!Wikipedia), [Duke of Milan](!Wikipedia). Leonardo had written, "I hate war, as all rational men hate it, but there seems no escape from its bestial madness." Not while men of genius bend their talents to it, Quine had added. Here was Highet's comeback.

Highet. What a piece of work. Builder and destroyer of his own legend. A fecund theorist but a distracted experimenter, an indifferent administrator but a champion politician. From the start of his career he had traveled to the capital, made himself known to congressmen an their staffs. In reward for such attentions he was at a young age appointed technical representative to a disarmament conference. His conduct was impeccable until one afternoon, goaded by the other side's mendacious presentation and by his own ungovernable need to command the center of every situation, he let slip classified data.

Highet made allies sooner than friends, and enemies sooner than either. After this gaffe his allies were silent while his enemies pounced. [pg6] But Highet made the first of the hairsbreadth escapes on which his legend was built. A paper published a year before, cosigned by the President's science advisor, had exposed the same secret. The hearings were dropped and Highet was exiled to an underfunded oubliette of the Lab housed in temporary trailers: J Section.

Anyone else would have languished there. But Highet built by inches a power base, using his charisma to attract the brightest, most driven graduate students he could find, forming in the meantime new political alliances. When Congress at last funded Radiance, all the necessary talent was in J Section, and fiercely loyal to Highet. Soon he was associate director. Two years later, the director retired and Highet filled his place.

J Section. Research And Development In Advanced Nuclear Concepts. Concepts as in weapons. Advanced as in not working yet. Radiance's charter was to develop energy weapons of all types, but Highet's hope and pet was the [Superbright](!Wikipedia "Project Excalibur"): an [orbiting battle station of hairthin rods webbed around a nuclear bomb](!Wikipedia "Strategic Defense Initiative#X-ray laser"). The bomb's ignition would charge the rods with energy, focused into beams that would flash out to strike down enemy missiles, all in the microsecond before the station consumed itself in nuclear fire.

So far the beams flashed out only in theory. The theory, originated by Null, seemed to Quine sound, but the more he studied his computer model, the less he understood why any of Null's tests had ever produced the ghost of a beam. Yet the farther tests fell behind expectations, the more strident became Highet's public claims. Warren Slater^[Roy Woodruff; for coverage, see the previously cited books by Broad, and other news articles eg. ["THE MAN WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE ON 'STAR WARS': Roy Woodruff's Ordeal Began When He Tried to Turn the Vision of an X-ray Laser into Reality"](http://articles.latimes.com/print/1988-07-17/magazine/tm-9636_1_x-ray-laser).], in charge of testing, had resigned in protest. His letter of resignation was classified and squelched. Bernd Dietz was given interim charge of testing, and to Quine fell the task of finding in disappointing test data any optimism about the promised results.

<!-- TODO -->

Meanwhile Highet had grown ever more reckless. He began showing up at high profile conferences and seminars in subjects outside his field: on neural nets, genetic programming, nanotechnology, virtual reality, cold fusion, artificial life, making no discrimination between the cutting edge, the speculative, and the snake oil, as if the force of his character could remake physical law, or at least the local version of it. He spoke in banquet halls at Red Lion Inns, he passed out abstracts, [pg7] offprints, videotapes, he painted futures brighter and more definite than the present, with himself and his visions at the center of them, inviting the wise and the bold to sit with him in the prosperity and rectitude of that inner circle, outside which was darkness, barbarism, and chaos.

<!-- TODO -->

*And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude*. Again the voice. In the mind's shadows were countless voices, dead, living, unborn, lost. Since working on Radiance Quine had dreamed them. Now they came into his waking life. This voice he recognized from Leonardo's notebooks.

<!-- TODO -->

On his second computer, secure in steel shielding, waited Quine's simulation of the rods. This frail superstructure of hope was raised on a sprawling foundation of faith. Hundreds of man-years of Lab effort and ingenuity had gone into the underlying physics codes [programs]. Even so, it was not possible that they could describe the full complexity of a nuclear blast. Simplifications and estimates entered in, acceptable only because their results matched experimental data to some more or less arbitrary tolerance. Radiation transport, magnetic fields, burn products, photon scattering, thermal conduction, ion viscosity, [bremsstrahlung](!Wikipedia), all these imponderables had to be calculated and updated, interacting in every kernel of space, at every nanosecond. If Quine had once puzzled for years over the paradox of a single photon, the complexities here were literally unthinkable. The reward of deep understanding was not part of the package.

None of this cauldron of approximation, this vast rationalization, this ingenuous mimickry, was Quine's responsibility. To him it was a [black box](!Wikipedia). His laser simulation ran on top of it all, passing it data, receiving its judgments. Again he ignited his bomb and waited for the nuclear pinball of particles and energies to reach his rods. Color bars and line graphs crept across the screen, the visible satisfactions of programming. The solipsistic machine worlds. It was near to pornography, without nuance. Any halfbright notion could be simulated, the simulation tweaked to an approximation of success, and the success conjured as proof for more funding. Tweak and squeak, as Highet put it. Realization was a "materials" problem. Bend your backs, men, to prove this golden turd of an idea. [pg8]

The display glitched and broke into the [debugger](!Wikipedia). Lines of [code](!Wikipedia "C (programming language)") filled the screen, `void qelem`, [`malloc(xarray)`](!Wikipedia "malloc"), `atof(nptr)`. He ceased to see words or even letters, his eyes grasping instead at the pixels, the shards of light within the characters. That radiance within the meanest mote of being.

What is light? Surfaces boil with quantum fire. How comes this dumb swarming to write beauty, alarm, or desolation upon the soul? Eyes are the questing front of the brain, the channel to the heart. The eye may not, as [Archytas](!Wikipedia) thought, emit illuminating rays, but our knowledge of its working is no surer than his.

Mind's eye and heart's channel presented him now Kate's russet hair, her full mouth and cheeks, her dimpled chin, her dark eyes framed by wire glasses. Like a key those features fit his heart. They appeared before him like a truth of nature. Mostly he lived in the mundane, scarcely noting what or whom he passed, but at rare moments the world came forward in all its vividness, stunning his heart. Every time he saw Kate, there was that shock of presence.

She was 23, he 37. They'd met in a yoga class. He hadn't pursued at first. He was coupled with Nan, a quiet woman his own age who worked at the Lab. They lived apart but spent half their spare time together. He was content and not content with what they had. But he and Kate talked, and they went out a few times. She seemed interested in him. Her eyes met something in his. Some hope had stirred in him, some need for joy so long put by he'd ceased to miss it. Thus fed his need grew, covert but unchecked. The years separating him from Kate, years he'd squandered in ever more esoteric projects at the Lab, seemed his to reclaim at will. Kate's attention fed in him some myth of starting over. He grew testy with Nan and impatient with himself, seeking not a break between them but between themselves and what he now acutely felt them becoming, burdens and reproofs to each other. Nan waited him out. Her deepening disappoint in him was unspoken but heavy. His desperation grew until he could contain it no longer and he lay it before Kate, blurted it out, a bitter plea. Save me. Who wouldn't flee from that? She regarded him kindly. Oh Philip, the moment's passed. It just didn't happen for us. There's someone else. That the moment could pass. That he had let it. Had not seen it passing. [pg9] Such a small thing, that attention, that renewed hope, briefly given and withdrawn, gone now.

The morning too was gone to no end. Every failure now he referred back to that moment, and he saw in his life only patterns of failure and emptiness.

Quine avoided that part of the building where Highet's young theorists worked, X Section, or, as the older men called it, the Playpen. But today his customary exit was blocked by a tour group of weary adults and bored children in facepaint, their guide saying, --tiny robots that actually repair human cells, as he swerved past a sign WARNING TOUR IN PROGRESS NON-CLASSIFIED CONVERSATION ONLY to the swell of the Brahms Requiem in full clash with The Butthole Surfers and a rapid din of simulated combat followed by the admiring exclamation, --Studly!

--He was one of these, shall I say, Marxist radical types. His mother cut him out of the family money. Hello, Philip. We're waiting for Leo [pg10] as usual. So he's in Prague now selling laptops to the Czechs. Ah, the man himself.

--Who's this you're talking about, sounds like he's figured out that free markets are diplomacy by other means. Everyone, this is Jef Thorpe, postdoc from the University of Utah, he's here to look us over. Jef worked with [Fish and Himmelhoch on cold fusion](!Wikipedia "Cold fusion#Fleischmann.E2.80.93Pons experiment"), and I just want to say don't believe the conventional wisdom, something is happening there^[It's worth mentioning here that one of the LLNL principals involved in Project Excalibur, [Peter L. Hagelstein](!Wikipedia), would investigate cold fusion after leaving LLNL.]. Jef, this is Dennis Kihara, our new press officer, he takes the heat for my excesses. Bernd Dietz, materials and research. Frank Szabo, systems integration. Phil Quine, our x-ray focusing guru, Philip, Jef's done interesting work in your area, you should sit down with him. Okay, all present? Let's do it.

Highet seated the young man opposite Quine. Jeans, jacket over t-shirt, short black hair, high color, a small gold stud through his left nostril, his presence a breach of protocol and probably security, though the others knew better than to say so.

--You all see the news last night? About the protest? The good news is we won. First they showed the protesters, out on the street, wind noise, bad lighting, and then our rebuttal from our respectable office. We won because we got to go last, and they put us last because we provided closure. That's the model for our presentation: beginning, middle, end. We'll begin by showing footage of successful tests. The middle will be video simulations of the system, where we'll highlight potential problems. By defining the problems we control the questions. And we'll end by addressing the problems and introducing entirely new approaches and spin-off programs. Dennis is running things, but I may break in at any point.

--Leo, can we skip the last part, the science fiction?

--No, Bernd. Past, present, future. Closure. Without this you leave people ready to ask questions.

--We're avoiding questions?

--Not if they're intelligent and informed but we have a few critics and wise guys on this panel and I'd like to keep it simple.

--Leo, I have more respect than you for the intelligence of senators. Congressmen are not always so bright but

--Bernd, it's simple courtesy. We inform them at a level that's neither [pg11] condescending nor technical, we tell them their money is being well spent, show them how, say thanks so much.

--Salesmanship.

--Grow up, Bernd, a couple times a year I ask you to do this. Is the money well spent? Yes or no.

--Yes, yes.

--I'd ah, feel better if we could discuss the middle part in ah detail, there are just some questions that I'm not comfortable to address without ah, just a little more input. For example the focusing data...

--Dennis, only Slater has questioned that data, and he's gone. Discredited. Focus is now Philip's baby.

--So, ah, focus is our main problem?

--Yes, it's one, said Quine. --Focus, brightness...

--But we're within an order of magnitude?

--I don't see any quantitative agreement with theory, said Quine. --The tests have shown a few bright spots. That's all I'm willing to commit to.

--That's all you've committed to for what is it ten months now Philip?

--I don't see any fundamentals. I'm beginning to wonder.

--Are you pulling a Slater on me, Philip? Because I want to tell you something, all of you. Some people in the lower echelons are making Slater out to be some kind of hero. To m this man was a menace to every one of us because he didn't care about winning. He didn't know what he wanted out of life and wouldn't have been able to get it if he had known. I have no respect for parasites like that.

--Leo, Null had a brilliant notion and we should pursue it, but that's all it is so far, a notion. We

--No one's questioned Null's theory, no one, not even critics.

--Sure but it's a long way from there to even a prototype

--We have supporting test data

--which may or may not mean qualitative agreement may or may not, but never quantitative, we have no understan

--well you're the one with the models Philip lo these many

--and you're the one who said this was a long term project, your words, long term, and now suddenly [pg12]

--oh sure, and if we all had seven lives

--now that there's a little pressure it's

--what I'm hearing

--it's suddenly urgent

--what I'm hearing from you Philip is that we need more shots. Convey that necessity to our guests when they're here, think you can do that? And put a little urgency into it?

--I won't pretend we have focus when

--You're not going to give me an inch are you?

--Not on the basis of spotty data I can't interpret.

--I tell you what. There's an eighty kiloton shot [bomb test] coming up next Saturday, right, Bernd? Piggyback it, Philip. Get yourself some better data.

--In what, a week? Design and fabricate apparatus in a week?

--Nine days. Jef can help you if he sticks around.

--Now hold on...

--Get off the pot. Let's move to Frank's contribution. You've all read it?

--Leo...

--We're moving on.

There was a brief silence in which papers rustled.

--Nothing new here, said Dietz.

--That's its strength. We've taken heat on preproduction technologies. This is a simple, viable off-the-shelf option. It's an easy sell. Contractors are lining up.

--It's good show-and-tell, said Szabo. --We can point to a card cage, this is the guidance system a year ago, then hold up a wafer, here it is today. Tangible progress.

Dietz continued to study the paper. --These are [Baldur](!Wikipedia "Brilliant Pebbles") [anti-satellite missiles](!Wikipedia) in a smaller package.

--That's right.

--These were shelved over ten years ago as an [ABM treaty](!Wikipedia) violation.

--That toilet paper? Let that worry us we might as well give up.

--These are not by any stretch of the imagination directed energy weapons. You want to put, what does it say, five thousand of these in orbit... [pg13]

--We're pursuing many options, Bernd. These would be one layer of a shield. Look, it's a long way to deployment. Oh and we get something else totally for free with Frank's idea. Always think [dual use](!Wikipedia). Put a warhead on these guys they're [earth penetrators](!Wikipedia "Kinetic bombardment"), aim them downward get a thousand g impact, three k p s terminal velocity, earth-coupled chock waves to destroy hardened shelters. We have a friend in the Pentagon who's hard for that and the Beltway boys know it.

--Wait just wait you mean, this, these ah interceptors are for the presentation? But it's, we need to address the existing problems, that's what they're coming for, we can't feed them something totally new! And with this Slater thing

--Dennis, trust me, it's the best possible thing to do. As far as Slater goes, he's history, a blip, not even an incident. This visit was scheduled long before his snit. Sure we'll get closer scrutiny than we would in the average dog-and-pony but it's an opportunity. Remember NORAD's famous [false alarms and screwups](!Wikipedia "North American Aerospace Defense Command#False alarms")? They get a billion-dollar facelift out of those incidents. You up to speed ow?

--Well yes, I mean no, not on the interceptors but...

--Put Frank's paper in the kit, I'll step in during the presentation. Oh, and make sure everyone gets a souvenir.

--A, I'm sorry?

--A souvenir. What are you giving the kids for family day today?

--Ah, some laser-etched aluminum disks...

--Good. Run off half a dozen make it a dozen more etched with the Radiance logo, can you do that? And glossies of the new artist's renderings.

Highet was out the door before anyone else had left their seat. Thorpe, abandoned, stood but did not move quickly enough to follow the older man out. As the seated men studied him incuriously he blushed and exited.

The others then rose. Szabo went out singing under his breath, --It's a long way, to deployment, it's a long way, I know. In the meantime, we have employment, it's the stick that makes us go...^[This might be an allusion to the popular military song "[It's a Long Way to Tipperary](!Wikipedia)".]

At the doorway Dietz said to Quine, --It is outrageous that he should bring a boy into that meeting and criticize you this way. Easy for him to make promises, but when the promises are not so easy to [pg14] deliver we suffer for them.

--I don't think the boy knew what he was getting into.

--Tell me what you want added to this test as soon as possible. He has put our asses on the line, both of us.

--I'll send you e-mail.

--Souvenirs! He gives senators souvenirs.

Quine had come to the Lab at [Réti](!Wikipedia "Edward Teller")'s invitation, Réti the legend, intimate of Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, founder of the Lab. Impossible to refuse. Réti had for one semester graced Quine's university with his presence, where he'd sat on Quine's doctoral committee. Quine must have made an impression, for two years later Réti called him. I hear you are working hard on some good ideas. How would you like unlimited resources for this work?[^resources] Come for the summer, work on what you will.

[^resources]: From Gusterson 2005:

    > Ted Taylor, perhaps Los Alamos' most prolific warhead designer, recalls the informality and lack of bureaucracy at Los Alamos in the 1950s thus:
    >
    >> In my seven years at the laboratory I never had to participate in the writing of a single grant proposal. . . . In Los Alamos in the '50s someone would get an idea and go down the hall and get Preston Hammer to put it on the computer and six weeks later you get printouts and find out whether the guess was right. If the results came out interesting you go up and talk to Carson Mark [the head of division] and he often would find some flaw. Or he'd say something like, "Well, I'll be damned", and then you'd cut across the overpass to the middle of the laboratory, the head of the explosives division, and he'd say, "That sounds great! We'll put it on the fission committee agenda." A week, two weeks later we'd have a fission-weapon committee meeting, and sometimes flaws turned up there. When they didn't, OK, we'll put it on the list. List for what? List for testing, either in Nevada or [Eniwetok](!Wikipedia), quite often in less than a year from the initial concept to the successful test.^27^

<!-- TODO: find the classic single-photon experiment being referenced here -->

Quine and Sorokin, a fellow postdoc, had isolated the emission of a single photon from a calcium source in order to determine whether a lone quantum displayed wave-particle complementarity. For two long years they had refined their approach, paring it to essentials, designing an experiment they might hope to realize with the school's meager resources. Elegance born of need. A slow and painful progress. At the Lab, in one month Quine was able to design and build a detector acute enough, and the experiment came off on the first try. Both tunneling and anticoincidence were evident. They had touched the central mystery. Even a single photo is both particle and wave.

Quine stayed. After that it was never a question. Not till much later did he guess that he'd been played. That Réti had his reason for waiting two years before approaching him. That by then his work was ripe for plucking, and the Lab's resources had little to do with its fruition apart from giving them the juice of it.

At the Lab his paper brought him a celebrity near to grace. Unlimited time to think. No assigned duties. And the mysteries ceased to open to him. Idle, he took up one of Highet's endless suggestions, the optics of x-ray mirrors. He welcomed the work, as though it paid some tithe of the mind to the practical. And it was a challenge, but finally it was, as the pioneers had with exact irony called their first bomb, a [pg15] ["gadget"](!Wikipedia "Trinity (nuclear test)"). Any solution, even if it laid bare principles, was beside the point if it couldn't kill missiles. So his mirrors never passed a design review. He wrote some computer codes for modeling the mirrors, and those turned out to have some peripheral application in inertial confinement fusion. The weapons work which he knew to be central to the Lab still seemed distant from him. Then Radiance geared up, and his modeling software proved flexible enough to accommodate the next idea: the bombpumped Superbright. Opportunistic as a virus, the Lab took it up. Now he was pressured. Now he was in a competitive atmosphere where the possibility of failure, of weakness, of doubt, could not be voiced even to oneself lest it undermine the resolve needed to get through each day. All the projects here were difficult, at the edge of the possible, and all the scientists worked at their limits and at the limits of their science. You could work on a problem for months only to have your work demolished in minutes in a review by your peers, your competitors, your colleagues. That was what reviews were for: to show up fatal flaws before they became expensively entrenched in a design. So ideas were hammered without mercy. It was and it wasn't personal. If the idea was good, it was yours but somehow beyond you, and if it was bad the attack was on it, not on you. Quine saw men in tears even as they went on arguing and, after it was over, thank their assailants[^tears].

[^tears]: From Gusterson 2005:

    > [a designer on the review process:]
    >
    >> We work as teams; if your team is about to have an experiment come up, particularly one in Nevada, then your group leader will say to you, "you can't work on that right now because we need you. Everybody's working together and people are depending on you to do predictions for this experiment." If you've just done an experiment, then he'll say "go for it!"
    >>
    >> And so there you are with your idea. What you do then if your idea still looks good is you go to your division leader. Someone might come to me and say, "I want to propose an experiment."^61^ At that point you are asking for $50 million, typically. So that what happens then is that you go through a very intensive peer review process. We start pulling together groups of people, and you'd brief your idea to maybe fifteen or twenty people, and they'd try very hard to find reasons why it doesn't work because this is a very expensive business and you do everything you can to find errors before you actually go do the experiment. So you keep doing that. These are not nice reviews. They're very critical. I've seen men all in tears.
    >>
    >> Question: What percentage of the ideas would survive?
    >>
    >> Answer: small percentage. The culture in that division - this is really interesting too - the big reward in our division is to do an experiment, to get your idea tested. It's highly competitive. For every twenty things people propose, maybe one is going to make it onto that shot schedule. If you have a really good idea. Let's say it's a REALLY good one, and it's recognized to be that way, then what we will do is put everything aside in the shot schedule. We have a lot of flexibility. And, just like magic, we'll matrix a team together. We can do that in a couple of days. The minute we put an experiment on the shot schedule that happens. So all of a sudden you find yourself with fifty people supporting you, all trying to help you research this idea.^62^

    > - 61: The narrative here makes it sound as if weapons designers go straight from computer calculations and presentations to review committees to $50 million nuclear tests. As Laura McNamara points out (131-132) [[_"Ways of Knowing" about Weapons: The Cold War's End at Los Alamos National Laboratory_](http://wwwfas.bluebox-placeholder.com/programs/ssp/nukes/newweapons/cwendlosalamos.pdf) (PhD dissertation, University of New Mexico, 2001), 114-115.], the reality is more complicated:
    >
    >    > Nuclear tests were not the first stage of empirical validation, although they were certainly the most dramatic. Rather, the validation process often began with a less expensive, less risky *hydrodynamic test*, a high explosive experiment that would provide a limited empirical benchmark for the designer's model. Often referred to as 'local shots' because they were conducted at Los Alamos proper, hydrodynamic experiments approximated full-scale nuclear tests insofar as they tested a mock-up of the design under development. Compared to a full-scale nuclear test, doing a local shot during the Cold War was a relatively simple process that moved from concept to test fairly rapidly, within a few months. . . . Local shots used no nuclear materials, just high explosives and inert components, and returned only data about implosion dynamics: e.g., how would a particular part move and change as the high explosive detonated?
    >
    > - 62: The person in charge of designing a device for a test was referred to as the Design Physicist (DP), and weapons designers traditionally built their reputations by being DP for devices they had designed and seeing their tests go well. In the idealized narrative above, our hypothetical designer has an exciting idea and is therefore put in charge as DP. In practice, by the 1980s, shots were designed by teams and the contributions of individual designers were harder to disentangle. After one conversation with a Los Alamos secondary designer I made the following entry in my notes: "They often make younger physicists DP now to give them experience. In the old days there were more tests, and people got more chance to truly do their own tests and be DPs of projects they'd initiated and controlled. These days, with a different design culture and less tests, the tests tend to be based more on teamwork and the decision who gets to be DP is based more on social and political factors: in part, they try to rotate the privilege and the responsibility. He [the designer] sees warhead design becoming more like plane or rocket design, where the product is so much a team effort that you're not sure who did what." On the increasing dissolution of the individual author or inventor in physics, see Peter Galison, "The Collective Author", in Mario Biagioli and Peter Galison (eds.), _Scientific Authorship: Credit and Intellectual Property in Science_ (Routledge, 2003), 325-355.

Throughout this he kept silent faith with the mysteries. He would return to them when the pressures of the moment were past. Programming took only the surface of his mind; its essence he held in reserve, or so he thought. Quine came at last to understand that he did well at his assigned tasks precisely because he brought them his all. Nothing was left over.

---

When he left the building the sun was low. The air was thick with heat, and as he started the car the radio blurted --record temp, before he silenced it.

Through the gate traffic slowed. Demonstrators in costume paraded in the road. Quine edged forward through skeletons and spooks with signs and props, TECHNOLOGIES OF DEATH, a longrobed mantisheaded figure towering on stilts above the crowd, tambourines jangling, EL DIA DE LOS MUERTOS, and lab security herding the [pg16] crowd off the road. As he cleared the crowd a klaxon blared. The mantis swayed, tugging at robes snagged on the perimeter razorwire as the entrance gates slid shut, alarm lights strobing. On the inner perimeter road security vehicles appeared, racing toward the entry kiosk. Then he saw standing by his passenger window the woman who resembled Kate. She wore black spandex bicycle pants and a blue chambray shirt. She was staring at the gate. Quine hesitated, then rolled down the window.

--You want a ride out of here? They're going to start arresting people.

She looked at him, then back at the gate. On the main road Quine saw a flurry of approaching lights. City police.

--I can't wait.

Whoops blasts squeals cut the crowd noise. She saw the vehicles approaching and with something like annoyance got into Quine's car. Quine sped away shutting his window against the shriek of the passing vehicles.

--I'm Philip Quine.

--Lynn Hamlin. Did you see what happened?

When he looked at her all resemblance fell away. Same body type, same round features, but hair almost black with a russet tinge, cropped close to the neck. No glasses. Dark penetrating eyes. Tanned calves faintly downed, lithe as a huntress's. No key turned in his heart, just an echo of loss.

--The one on stilts, his costume caught on the fence. It must have set off the alarm.

--Were you there for the demo?

--No. I work there.

His ID was still clipped to his jacket. She'd been looking at it, and now she smiled, as if to confide her little subterfuge.

--What do you work on?

He turned onto a road parallel to the freeway, where earthmovers were parked in torn up lots behind emporia of sporting goods, fast food, auto parts, videotapes, computers, discount carpets. Sun flashed through the struts of a half finished retaining wall.

--Defense weapons. [pg17]

--You mean Radiance. Do you believe in it?

*And those in the anterooms of Hell demur, saying, I do not approve what goes on inside.*

--It's what I do.

--Do you know what Einstein said? That you can't simultaneously prepare for war and prevent it?

--Where can I drop you?

--Corner of Mariposa.

As they passed over the freeway, the sun struck their shadow out toward the golden eastern hills. He sensed her still looking at him, then she faced ahead.

--I like this time of day, she said. --The light.

--I don't, said Quine. --It makes me think of endings.

She said nothing to that. As the car descended into the shadow of the overpass Quine said, --We didn't hear about the protest. The organizers usually let us know.

--Maybe they're tired of playing your game.

--It's not my game. A green sign with white letters Mariposa hung over the intersection. Quine pulled to the curb by a bus stop bench placarded FAST DIVORCE BANKRUPTCY. She turned to him with sudden vehemence.

--These demonstrations won't stop, you know. You don't know how angry people are... Her voice held some doubt, whether for the anger or his belief in it, he couldn't tell.

--Then I'll probably see you again out there, he said.

--Tell me, what's the point, I mean, isn't it obviously a waste now that the cold war

--Look, and hearing the annoyance in his voice he stanched it, --I don't make policy...

--Well, that's part of the problem, isn't it. People not taking responsibility for what they do.

Pricked, he turned to her just as a bus pulled to the curb, the squeal of its brakes preempting whatever he might have meant to say. Some hurt might have remained in his eyes. She seemed abashed and held his gaze for a moment longer before reaching to unbuckle her seatbelt.

--Listen... would you have lunch with me sometime? [pg18]

She looked at him in surprise. --Lunch? Why?

--I'd just like to talk more.

--Do we have anything to say to each other?

--We could find out. His pulse thickened in his throat.

--But you're the enemy, she said.

--Me...? He caught, under her serious dark brow, a glimpse of mischief, though she didn't smile.

--Thanks for the ride.

She was out the door before he felt the protest of his heart. So even now he had not relinquished hope.

---

When he got home Nan's car was in his parking space. Most Tuesday nights she spent with Quine. He went to her place Friday nights and some weekends. But he'd worked late Tuesday, so they'd shifted it to tonight. He'd forgotten.

--Lo, she called, --In the kitchen. I picked up some tortellini at Il Fornaio and a salad, is that okay?

--Fine. As he entered she turned with a wary smile. The sight of her brought him a roil of giddiness, of memory, of guilt, of sadness. Her features were sharp and fine, her skin pale, her straight auburn hair just starting to show gray, her slight body always dressed with a style that in its impeccability read as a brave front.

--Bread's in the oven, can you get that?

He looked for an oven mitt while she talked about her day, some seniority conflict in the personnel department. Quine's patience wore. When, setting the plates down, she bent to kiss his neck, he flinched.

--What's wrong?

--Nothing. It's just Highet's going mad again. A Congressional visit's coming up, it should be routine, but he acts like the whole program's at stake.

--Is it?

--First he drops Null's work in my lap, then today he starts pimping some lunatic idea of Szabo's, and he assigns me a postdoc like, like a chaperone... and the protesters.

--What about them?

--They're getting on my nerves. [pg19]

They ate in silence for a few minutes. At last he said, --What would you think if I quit?

--Quit? Your job?

--Yes.

--But Philip, what would you do?

--Well, I don't know. I could take some time off to think about it.

--Time off? I thought that we were trying to save money...

--Save...?

--Philip, I'm not trying to pressure you, but I thought we agreed that it makes sense to look for a place together...

--I told you, Nan, I can't think about that while this project is on, I can't make big plans like that until this whole thing is, is settled.

--Well, couldn't we start looking just to see what's available, just go to a few open houses...?

--If you want. But I don't see the point if we can't afford it yet.

--The point is to plan for a future, Philip. Haven't you made any progress?

--Progress, I feel like I'm chasing my tail, there's no progress to be made!

--Please don't snap at me.

--I, I can't even discuss it with you, you don't have the clearance.

She stood and carried dishes into the kitchen. He got up to follow.

--Nan... He came up behind her and embraced her. Her hands rested on his forearms.

--What about Sunday?

--Sunday?

--We're seeing Ginny and Bill, remember? If you came early we could

--Sunday. Look, I have a deadline. I can't. I'm sorry but I just can't.

--You're working? But if you're not getting anywhere...

--Well but that's the whole problem isn't it! Meantime there are still short-term goals and meetings.

She sighed and left the kitchen. In the living room the television came on. When after a moment he entered the room he heard her in the bedroom speaking on the telephone. Remote control in hand he viewed a cool panoptic tumble of war famine catastrophe enormity [pg20] larded with a fantastic plenty of goods caressed by smiling tanned models, to pause on the logotype of Martin Marietta, --a proud supporter for twenty-five years of science programming on public television, his impulse to switch again frozen by the worn, imposing face of Aron Réti, saying thickly, --In science there is a cult of the beautiful theory. But how beautiful is reality? These beautiful theories, these elegant mathematics are not verified by experiment. Experiment shows us a mess of a universe with over a hundred basic particles and three irreconcilable forces. We would like to unify them all, just as we would like to smooth over all the political differences in the world. But experience shows, in physics and in politics, that this is not always possible.

Abruptly the screen glared with the involute radiance of the bomb. Sun's heart. Cosmic ground. [Siva](!Wikipedia "Shiva") and [Devi](!Wikipedia) coupling. A thin roar issued from the set and the thick voice rode over it, --The duty of science is to pursue knowledge even if it leads to the unbeautiful. Or to evil. How else learn about evil?

Nan returned to sit beside him. --Isn't that Réti?

The camera returned to the physicist. Emeritus director, Réti was rarely at the Lab; the office he kept there served him solely as a clubroom or a backdrop. Six months ago a film crew had come to the Lab. Quine had heard Réti shouting at them behind the closer door.

--What, this is what Highet calls the liberal bias of the media, said Quine as the camera went to the interview.

--After the war, many of your colleagues turned away from weapons. Some of them have won Nobel Prizes. Do you feel that your work with weapons has cost you [credibility or respect within the scientific community](!Wikipedia "Edward Teller#Oppenheimer controversy")? Has it compromised you as a scientist?

--Never. In fact it has challenged and improved me as a scientist.

--You're closely connected to Radiance. What about recent charges that test results have been faked?

--This is a lie! First, I am not closely connected...

--But you've lobbied extensively for Radiance in Wash

--I am no lobbyist! I am a private citizen with some scientific expertise, and when I am asked to testify about technical matters I do so... [pg21]

--But for over forty years you've been an advocate of nuclear weapons. Your authority and influence are well known.

<!-- TODO -->

--Now you listen to me. It is an imperfect world, a dangerous world. There is evil in the world. How do you meet it? All ends, even the best, are reached by impure means. Reason is supposed to be the hallmark of science, but I tell you that no one is swayed by reason. a theory, an idea, does not make its own way. It was Einstein who said merit alone is very little good; it must be backed by tact and knowledge of the world. I know of many cases where maybe the data does not quite agree with your theory, no, you think, the carpers will question, your case is far clearer if you discard this set of data, if you report only these results. And who are these frauds? Ptolemy. Galileo. Newton. Bernoulli. Mendel. Millikan. What matters in the long run is not some wishful dream of scruples, but whether you have driven your knowledge home!

Behind the fury in Réti's eyes Quine saw a bright and open wound: more illustrious for his influence than his work, he had failed at everything but success. And Quine's own life, he suddenly saw, was bent around Réti's influence. A man has no wealth nor power but his knowledge, Réti had once said to Quine. But now he said that if power did not lead, knowledge could not follow. Quine stood, ignoring --Philip? what is it? and went to the bathroom. He held the sides of the sink, heart racing. In the cabinet he found the pill bottle.

<!-- TODO -->

*The spirit is radiant, yet there are two principles of radiance: that of light, and that of fire. Fire comes to the use of those who go not the way of light. And the difference is, that fire must consume its object.*

<!-- TODO -->

Quine returned to Réti's angry voice, --So I have no Nobel Prize, that accolade of the pure. But Alfred Nobel would understand me well. And history will be my judge, not you.

-What is it, Philip? What's the matter?

Quine turned to Nan, her face in the phosphor light bleak as a rock outcrop. He reached to touch her neck. Unsmiling she leaned her head against his hand. His fingers cupped her nape and he drew her mouth to his.

In the bedroom they undressed on opposite sides of the bed. The television droned on. Between her legs he felt the string of a tampon, [pg22] and as he touched it she bent double and enclosed him in her mouth. Above the activity of their bodies his spirit hovered sadly regarding the terrain of his life. Lightly his hands cradled her head. He began to pump semen. Deep inside him a talon drove home and brought forth, impaled, his soul, writhing. A minute later he was awash in sleep. Waiting at a counter to pick up xeroxes. Quick tap at his shoulder. Kate. She smiled, her eyes upon him, and he knew it was a dream, and he was happy, and he slept. [pg23]

### Two

The morning sky, pallid with haze, conveyed yet enough sun to cast through the high embrasure of his office window a faint rhombus which crept toward the doorway relentless as a horologue. From his desk Quine gazed at it half hearing the radio, --ildfires in three counties, when his phone rang.

--Quine.

--Is this Philip?

--Yes, who's this.

--Lynn. From the demo yesterday?

--Oh. Oh yes. How did you... He stood and paced with the phone. --How did you get my number?

--I called the switchboard. I want to apologize. I behaved badly. Are you free for coffee?

--Well I... not this morning.

--Later this afternoon?

--Well I...

--Don't let me pressure you.

--No I, I want to. It's just a surprise.

--I get off work at four. Do you know the Café Desaparecidos [the missing]? In the central mall. I work near there.

--Sure I, okay, I'll see you there about four.

As he hung up Jef Thorpe knocked on his open door. Black jacket, blue shirt, jeans. A faint pock where yesterday the nose stud had been.

--Come in. [pg24]

--I guess we'll be working together.

--Oh, you're staying.

--If you'll have me. Listen, that meeting yesterday, I didn't belong there, I'm sorry if...

--Not your fault. Doctor Highet has his way of doing things.

--Yeah, I see that. Listen, before we started I want to tell you, the single-photon experiment you did with Sorokin was really elegant. I was, you know, sort of surprised to find you here, I thought you'd be somewhere more theoretical.

--I thought everyone had forgotten that experiment by now.

--Oh no. It was very sweet work.

--The detector was critical. We worked on it for two years. We got it only after I came here.

--You didn't follow it up.

--Sorokin thought I was wrong to come here. He said it would be a black hole. He may have been right. Of course things look different from inside.

--Black hole, yeah, I've thought of that. But you know where I come from. That limits my options in the straight academic world.

--You don't have qualms about defense work?

--It's not what I'm here for.

--It's just, you might want to consider your position. I came in neutral about defense work, but before long I was in the thick of it. It's easy to slip into.

--I'm sort of apolitical.

--Well, if that's what you want, turning to the computer which glowed with:

[^merit-badge]: pg80-81, McNamara 2001

    > The message about guarding one's laboratory self from a hostile world resonates through people's careers at Los Alamos. Much later in my fieldwork, I interviewed an engineer who told me that her favorite tee-shirt commemorated a successful Los Alamos engineering project. The back of the shirt listed all the team members' names. "I never, ever wear that shirt in Wild Oats," [an alternative food store like Whole Foods; apparently closed as of 2013] she told me, with a serious smile. "I don't want anyone to know that I work at Los Alamos, or to know the names of any of the people that I work with. I don't want to put myself or any of my team members in jeopardy."

    pg184:

    > One of the most interesting things about the testing program is the amount of memorabilia generated in the course of a test: stickers, t-shirts, hats and other souvenirs generated during the course of an event, much like t-shirts bought at a concert or a poster from a rodeo. The laboratory did not provide the memorabilia; rather, the people involved in each event used the test name as a springboard for developing an icon and a set of souvenirs for each test. Symbolically, individuals "collected" testing experience in the form of these souvenirs, and displayed them to their peers. Regardless of field - design, engineering, diagnostics - I could always tell when an office was occupied by an experienced member of the weapons community, since the door or walls would be decorated, sometimes covered, with stickers and/or small posters bearing the name of the event as well as a cartoon or a drawing related to the name. Similarly, at the test site, personnel often attach small pins and patches to their work clothes, or wear baseball hats sporting the name of a particular test. One of my tour guides at the test site explained the souvenirs by referring to the camaraderie that the intensity of a test engenders among test participants. "You become a team, like any other team," he told me. "These help you remember what it was like to be part of that particular team." For this physicist, the many t-shirts, hats, pins, stickers, certificates, and posters he had collected over years of involvement in the testing program served as markers of his identity as an active member of the weapons community.

Quine cleared the screen and brought up the Superbright test data.

--You see. Intense brightness here, and here. Very erratic pattern.

--This data is picked up how?

--When the bomb ignites, radiation from the rods bounces off some reflectors to

--X-ray mirrors?

--Yes, something like that. They're [beryllium](!Wikipedia). The data agrees with theory to a point, but when we increase power, we don't get an increase in beam, in fact we get less. We've talked about trying different metals in the rods, we've used gold till know, but mercury...

--Yeah, elements seventy-two through ninety-five would be good to try but with the, you know, time constraints, I checked and Fabrication has gold rods ready to go, so maybe those are a good choice and you can, or I mean we can sort of concentrate on sensor configuration...

--Sounds reasonable.

Thorpe continued to stare at the screen. --Could this be an [annular](!Wikipedia "Annulus (mathematics)")? This pattern I mean, could those reflectors be picking up a sort of imperfect focus, you know, the edge of a ring? If we move them in...

--I've tried, no luck.

--Can I look at your focusing code?

--Yes, sure, all the files are in this directory.

--That's great. Mind if I work here? pointing to Null's desk.

--Ah, sure. Sure, go head. I'm going for lunch and maybe a swim. I'll see you later.

Gaunt, saturnine, Bran Nolan in a corner of the cafeteria looked up unsmiling from scattered papers to raise a hand in greeting. [pg26]

--How's our new boyo Kihara?

--Weren't you in line for that position?

--It's my Tourette's syndrome. Terrible liability in a press officer, never know what he might blurt out in public.

--You should have been asked.

--Do you know, I'm happier, if that's the word I want, where I am. Kihara is a little lamb. The last man, Vessell, didn't outlast Slater. And we're not done with all that, no indeed.

--Getting some work done? Quine indicated the papers.

--"The Lab has a longstanding commitment to developing new methods and technologies to protect the environment", the most effective of which to date has been the press release. Do you know we have a toxics mitigation program now? Seems there's a toxic plume seeping into the groundwater under a vineyard off the north boundary. Vines died, soil went gray, the whole field stinks like sepsis. I'm writing an upbeat report about it. And yourself? How's the death ray coming?

--We can maim small insects at a meter. The new concept is interceptors. Small flying rocks.

--Do you know, da Vinci invented shrapnel. He'd have been right at home here with all these advanced minds.

--Yes, that's Highet's conceit.

--Throwing rocks at things. We should be proud, thinking about these old impulses in such an advanced way.

A plump figure cam forward shaking a sheaf of papers, from which Nolan recoiled. --Bran, Bran, Bran. What must I do to get you to use a font other than [Courier](!Wikipedia "Courier (typeface)")?

--Hello Bob, how's the gout? I don't like this business of tarting up manuscripts. You get enchanted by the beauty of it all. You start to think you're writing the [Book of Kells](!Wikipedia).

--A few attractive fonts, tastefully applied, can spice up a presentation. A little [humanitas](!Wikipedia), you know. Why else, Bran, did we get you that powerful and costly workstation?

--I don't know, Bob, why did you? I was still figuring out the [type balls on my Selectric](!Wikipedia "IBM Selectric typewriter").

The sheaf of papers fell fanning from their clip onto the table. [pg27]

Shaking his head and chuckling grimly, Bob passed on to another table.

<!-- TODO Elect? -->

--Humanitas, yes, that's what we need here, isn't it, Highet with his Renaissance, and [Aldus Manutius](!Wikipedia) there, need a few more particle men who've read the Tao Te Ching, couple more manages who've studied Sun Tzu, lend these binary views a little tone, dress up the winners and losers, the Elect and the Preterite, the screwers and the screwed. Each man in his station, and keep your distance from the low life, can't have just anyone winning, because if you ever let the rabble ahead, if they can rise, you can surely fall.

Nolan folded back pages, --listen to this bit, "the support of this tight-knit community", support is it now? I'd have said the goading, the ambition, the Schadenfreude, that's what gets the work done. The wife walked out six months ago with the kid, you're eating Campbell's soup cold out of the can, you haven't got a clean shirt, but after a few months of eighteen hour days you've got *data* that everyone wants to see. You *win big*.

--Bran, you work here, too.

--What should I do then, write novels? Or maybe journalism, that's it, *investigative* journalism. Have you met the journalist from Cambridge? Right over there with his tape recorder, name's [Armand Steradian](!Wikipedia "Hugh Gusterson"). He's researching the belief systems of those who work on weapons of mass destruction^[Gusterson's Lab research has been published as [_Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0520213734) & [_People Of The Bomb: Portraits of America's Nuclear Complex_](http://www.amazon.com/People-Of-The-Bomb-Portraits/dp/0816638608).], I think that was his phrase. Quite the charmer. He's published one book on scientific fraud, and a paper highly critical of what he calls the defense establishment. You probably don't watch TV but there was a program on PBS last night, Steradian was in it abusing Réti.

--Does Highet know he's here?

--Highet invited him.[^Gusterson-access]

[^Gusterson-access]: In a [2002 interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/science/a-conversation-with-hugh-gusterson-finding-rich-fodder-in-nuclear-scientists.html?pagewanted=all "A CONVERSATION WITH/Hugh Gusterson; Finding Rich Fodder In Nuclear Scientists"), Gusterson portrays it more informally:

    > There was an undergraduate in my department whose father worked at Livermore. My adviser said, "Why don't you drive down there and see so-and-so's father?" So I drove there one evening...This man led me to other people in the lab. Thereafter, whenever I interviewed someone, I'd ask my subject to refer me to others. I also began a program of "deep hanging out." I moved to the town of Livermore. My roommates often worked at the lab. I went to local churches, to bars, to the singles group. I ate lunch at the lab's cafeteria.

Quine headed for the door, passing as he did Armand Steradian, who held a small microphone before a J Section technician, --you're so goldang busy every day you just put off thinking about it, though in Quine's view pressure was a tool well used to put off thinking.

---

Black cottonwoods around the pool throve despite the drought. Their catkins littered the water. A jet moved on the sky, stitching a contrail [pg28] across a lace of cloud where a white sun struggled. Quine sat on a towel on the grassy verge and watched a portly swimsuited man enter through the gate, barrel chest glossed with hair, and behind him a woman in a white halter top and shorts, the heads of three men turning to follow. The pool was crowded this Friday afternoon; it was warm, it was the end of the workweek, it was family day; unlike Quine, most worked a five day week, most would depart hence into a forgetfulness. In the shallows of the pool two young girls splashed. One opened her mouth to show her companion a bright penny on her outstretched tongue. A young mother in a black maillot gripped a ladder to raise herself half from the pool and wave at her infant in a nearby stroller, glisten and shadow in the cords of her back, and Quine suffered a pang for a life now beyond his knowing: to be wed, with child, so young. On thermals a black and white winged vulture, _[Cathartes aura](!Wikipedia)_, rocked and banked. From the jet thunder fell like muffled blows. The warmth and the sound of water churned by swimmers and the spray tossed up by their passing lulled Quine into a lethargy from which he woke with a start to consult his watch. On the pool's floor danced cusps of light.

The café's walls rose past exposed beams and ducts to the nacre of frosted skylights. Lynn sat in a wirebacked chair at a glass table, face downcast at papers before her. In the moment before she looked up, Kate's face glowed before him. What do you do, Philip?

--Hoy es el [día de los muertos](!Wikipedia), Lynn said in greeting, banishing Kate's image. Angularities all her own moved in her flesh; a small gap showed between her teeth as she smiled.

Quine seated himself and said gravely, --I should tell you I'm involved with someone.

--Gee, I said I wanted to apologize, not start an affair.

--I, sorry I...

--And maybe pick your brain about Radiance.

--I'm sorry, I, what did you say before? El día...

--Today is the Day of the Dead. All Saint's Day. All of California used to be Mexico, you know, they called it [Aztlan](!Wikipedia "Aztlán#Use by the Chicano movement"). Once my group shuts the Lab down, we're going to reclaim Aztlan for the native peoples [pg29]. Oh, don't look that way, I'm joking, that's the kind of thing the far right says about us.

--Your group?

--Citizens Against Nuclear Technology^[Possibly the [Livermore Action Group](!Wikipedia "Anti-nuclear protests in the United States#Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory").]. I'm a paralegal with them.

--What's that your reading?

--Your press releases. She held a sheaf set in unadorned Courier font. --You people have fingers in a lot of pies. When I started my concern was the bombs, but that's just the tip of the iceberg, isn't it. There's also the supercomputers, the lasers, the genetics, the chemicals...

--You probably know more about it than I do.

--Your cover stories are so creative. Every one of. Oh, go ahead, order, she's waiting.

--Cappuccino. What do you mean, cover stories?

--Quisiera un espresso por favor. Every one of these quote benign technologies has a pretty easy to imagine military use. Laser x-ray lithography for etching microchips, uh huh, right, and here's one about kinder gentler [C](!Wikipedia "Chemical warfare")[B](!Wikipedia "Biological warfare")W, "less virulent" tear gas for "crowd control", heavier [specific gravity](!Wikipedia) for controlled delivery, if this is the stuff you're public about I can only imagine the rest.

--You're wrong, there's a genuine effort to convert to peacef

--Dual use, I know. Genuine effort to blur the line is what it is, and it goes far beyond the Lab, people in physics and comp sci departments across the country are lining up at the same trough, the grants are there and if they don't take the money someone else will. That's the reasoning. What a waste of talent and resources.

--It's more complicated than that. The people I work with, they're not cynical.

--Yes, I know how people get caught up in their work. I have a friend there, not in Radiance, in another section. He's a Quaker, he calls it "being in the world". At least he's thought about it. How did you get into it?

--Me? I'm, well, a lapsed theorist. But I'm not typical... Was he not? Réti, Highet, Dietz, Thorpe, all had failed in some subtle way that in such a place could be denied. But where was there not failure and denial?

--Do your people pay any attention at all to our demonstrations? [pg30]

--In J Section? Not much.

--We seem to bug your boss, at least.

--Highet?

--In his little red sports car. What about you? What did you think about the big one yesterday?

--It seemed, I don't know, festive, almost a costume party, I didn't realize at first it was Halloween...

--But no, that wasn't it. It was a ceremony. An exorcism.

--Oh come on, what, you mean we're possessed...

--By arrogance, if nothing else.

--That's absurd, you can't convince anyone with some absurd ritual...

--It's no different from your rituals, your bomb tests, just as absurd, but really dangerous!

--They're not my tests... and he remembered _B. Dietz & P. Quine, sup._ --I'm sorry. I'm no good at talking about this.

The set of her features, so poised and eager, softened then and her voice lowered. --I don't mean to attack you. I'm sure you think about it.

--Yes but, but I'm not sure! What to do, I mean. What if it is a waste, what if, if all the money and the decades, all the lives and talent... then it's more than just me, it's not just my mistake, but something wrong at the root of it, and what, what can I do about that?

--If it is a mistake, you can face it. You could stop.

--But that wouldn't stop anything. It's almost as if these things we work on... they use us to get born. Could use anyone.

--It must be very hard for you. Their eyes met, and the troubled sympathy in hers wrung him. Her face was so concerned for him that he almost cried out with selfpity.

--It's not your fault. I, I need to get back now.

--I really am sorry, can we... can we forget about all this and just start over?

--Start over...?

Abruptly he rose and walked away stolid with loathing of his own erratic heart, and of her for stirring it.

---

[pg31] In the night he work sweating with a pulse of ninety, reached for the pillbottle next to the small box [DREAMLIGHT](!Wikipedia "Stephen_LaBerge#Lucid dreaming education and facilitation") Unlock Your Inner Potential and its plastic headset. The pills opened a plain of timelessness in which it seemed a lost part of himself dwelled. as he lay in their haze, his fluency returned. Wonderful problems enticed and yielded to his insight, wisdom depended from the sky like fruit. He kept a notebook in case any insight survived his waking. None did.

He attached the headset like a blindfold. At the onset of dreaming a strobe would flicker there and rouse him enough to [observe and direct his dream but not to wake](!Wikipedia "Lucid dream"). He settled and conjured an image: the battle station shining in the void of space. Slender arms and rods pivoting. The missile rise in swarms, bright points on the black hollow of a crescent Earth. They blur in a silver mist of chaff. Above the crescent distant battle stations ignite in globes of light, their beams lance out, but swarm follows swarm up from the Earth, far too many to destroy. He pulled off the headset.

The world has changed, the old enemy has collapsed into ruined republics. Yet despite this consummation of all the Lab has strived for, the work goes on, the mood is spiritless, the shots in the desert continue like some ritual of penance, some black and endless propitiation of forces that in losing their fixed abode have grown closer and more menacing.

Stillness. Faint whistle of tinnitus, first sounds of birdcall. Wan dawn light. The enemy is gone. But the work goes on and on.

### Three

[pg32] For a while Lynn was not among the protesters. Their numbers had diminished to a small contingent by the main gate, holding a drooping sheet painted DIABOLIS EX MACHINA. Quine slowed through the gate and stopped, valves in the engine ticking, for a backhoe lurching across the main road, and closed his window against the dust billowing toward him as he went on past an air hammer breaking a sidewalk to rubble, overtones of its chatter following him across the rock moat and into the building where, too late to retreat, he saw Thorpe seated at Null's computer tapping without letup at Quine's entrance.

--Morning, said Quine.

--Is it? I've been here all night. Something there for you to read.

On top of Quine's stack of journals, a year's unread accumulation, colored slips in their pages flagging articles that an earlier time would not have waited a day, was a xerox topped with a yellow sticker SEEN THIS? _[Physical Review Letters](!Wikipedia) 1954_. A dig at his age?

--I know it's old, said Thorpe. --But I think it applies. See, I started with an EE from a hick school, taught myself quantum mechanics by reading Dirac, so my perspective is sort of, things don't change that much. Lots of good ideas have been left hanging. That's how I found your paper... I mean... stumbling at having touched as he thought Quine's sensitive point, --not to say, it's just, you know, if you're a student like me, not well connected, not seeing all the latest preprints and hearing all the gossip, you need another way up. So this is my way, sort of looking for old forgotten stuff to build on. [pg3]

--So tell me about this.

--I came across it working for Fish and Himmelhoch, looking for a sort of nuclear model to explain the cold fusion reaction? Okay I know, the current wisdom is, there's no reaction, it's bogus, or if anything is happening it's electrochemical, okay, fine. But you know, if you model the process in a nuclear way, it looks like a phenomenon called [super-radiance](!Wikipedia). The equations are similar. Highet saw the connection.

--To this? Highet told you about Superbright?

--Very sharp guy.

--That's quite a breach of classification.

--He sort of hinted around it, citing the open literature. Anyway it's moot, I'm cleared now. What do you think?

--I'll read it when I get a chance, dropping it back on to the stack of journals.

--But, I mean, we don't have much time. Should I pursue it?

--What have you been doing?

--Well, here, let me show you, I started sort of modifying your code but I had a couple of quest

--You changed my files?

--No no I made copies, changes only on my copies and I

--Okay, but look, just be sure you log all your changes into the [CASE system](!Wikipedia "Computer-aided software engineering"), okay? You know how that works?

--Yes, sure but I wondered about a few things like where you've got this [array](!Wikipedia "Array data structure") of [reals](!Wikipedia "Floating point") here, what's that?

--That's the rod array, angles lengths diameters densities

--Okay I thought so, because see I was thinking if you make that something like ten to the minus ten here

--That's the thickness, we can't make rods that thin it's imposs

--But what if we play what-if with these numbers...

--Wait what are you do

--then the beam, oops that's a little extreme but you see what I

--But there's no, I mean sure, you can make the model do anything, but it has to correspond to reality!

--Sure, I'm just getting, you know, the feel of the system. But, oh here I wanted to know what this function does, this hyperbol

<!-- TODO -->

--Yes that's the response curve of the reflec, look, can this wait? [pg34] and without pausing Quine was out of the office as from speakers overhead a pleasant female voice advised, --Attention all personnel. Starting at midnight [tiger teams](!Wikipedia) will conduct exercises in this area using blank ammunition... and he turned into the restroom where at the end, past a row of sinks and urinals opposite metal stalls, a gym bag hung on a hook and steam billowed as Quine, elbows braced on a basin, looked up from the laving of his hands at a bass voice echoing around the hard tile, --bist du ein Tor und rein, to see in the mirror not his own eternally surprised features but fogged void, and turned from the hiss of his faucet to glimpse through the mist a hard white nude male body emerging to towel itself, still sing, --welch Wissen dir auch mag beschieden sein.

---

In the cavernous building where Dietz supervised, Quine watched long metal tubes welded one by one to the great monstrance in which the bomb would rest a quarter mile underground. From instruments at the ends of each tube hundreds of cables would run to the surface. Dietz displayed a blueprint of the cylinder.

--We are already welding. I cannot wait to know.

--Can you hold off a day or two? If I had any idea where to put the damn things I'd tell you if I had any idea even how to find what I'm looking for...

--We can go ahead with other things for just a little while. For a day. Now the rod configuration...

--Unchanged. I'm not touching that.

--Make sure, please, that Highet knows all this. Sometimes he wanders through here and if things are not what he expects he is most unpleasant.

<!-- TODO: Kammerer? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kammerer ? -->

Outside Highet's office Quine, arm raised to knock, from within heard Highet's insistent rasp, --like Kammerer, you know, it's not who makes the mistake it's who takes the blame, and at Thorpe's voice barely audible, --sorry for the poor son of a bitch stuck in his position at his age, barely shows his face, and Highet, --never passed a design review, Quine's ears flared with heat, the door before him turning flat and insubstantial as he lowered his hand and proceeded down the hall unseeing, guided by a familiarity more the prisoner's than the adept's [pg35] around a corner to a water fountain, stopped before a bulletin board and its overlapping notices O Section, programmer needed to model underground plumes K Section, LASS expert needed Z Section, multimedia guru sought B Section, materials engineer, while two young men passed, one saying, --I have no special loyalty to [OOP](!Wikipedia "Object-oriented programming"), and on to a further junction where a convex mirror above him presented an anamorphic view around the corner. There Nan emerged from a cross corridor with a wiry man, white teeth in a tanned face, blackhaired forearms folded. The two spoke briefly. The man put a hand on Nan's neck and bent forward to kiss her mouth. Quine turned back the way he had come, slowing only when he found he had nearly circled the building. He backtracked to Highet's door and entered without knocking.

--Get Thorpe out of my office.

Highet looked up in surprise. --What did he do to you, Philip? You look ready to spit.

--If he's so important give him his own space, I don't want him hanging around me.

--Thought you'd appreciate the company, thought he might be useful to you.

--What's that supposed to mean?

--Thorpe handles himself well, you could learn from him. Show some team spirit. Poor boy's feeling abandoned by you.

--I'll worth with him, but I don't have to like him or share office space with him. It's bad enough Null's stuff is still there.

--Thorpe has his own space. You want him out, you can tell him so. By the way, Réti's here for a visit, you might want to pay your respects. Instead of running around down in Fabrication with Dietz.

--Someone has to tend to those details.

--Let me tell you something, Philip, I'm a smart guy but to be brutally honest I'm a second rate physicist. I have the ideas but not the persistence, I've known that about myself for twenty years. But I've learned to position myself and to use other people to get what I want. Win win, you know, we help each other look good. You take my point?

Voices approach in the corridor as Highet went on in a lower tone, --One path in the world is up. There's also a path down. What there isn't is standing still. Now you, friend, have been standing still [pg36] for quite a little while. I'd say you need to make some career decisions soon, before they're made for you.

Flanked by two Lab factotums, Aron Réti came slowly, stamping his cane, into Highet's office. His eyes, azure behind thick lenses, peered without recognition as Quine greeted him. --Ah, my young friend, how are you?

--You remember Philip Quine, Aron. That beautifully sweet photon detector he built for us.

--Of course, of course.

--So here we are, three generations of first rate physics talent.

--Yes yes, the torch is passed.

--I really must be

--No, stay. Aron, Philip's going to get us the data we need to silence the critics.

--The critics, there is no need to mind them.

--From your eminence perhaps not, but I have to deal with these fools and dupes almost daily. Do you know what a senator, a United States senator, said to me the other day? He called this place a scientific brothel.

--I know the man you mean. Brothels I am sure he knows well, but of science he is ignorant.

--Well unfortunately this ignoramus chairs a committee that oversees our funding, so I have to deal with him.

--Speaking of influence, this left wing journalist, I see him here again, why do you let him in? Six months ago he abused my trust with gutter tactics of the worst sort.

--You mean Steradian? He's a useful idiot. He's so cocksure I let him hear things I want to see in print, look here... Highet lifted from the desktop a folded newspaper, --"Radiance Research Forges Ahead", see, this is solid gold. He's so excited when he hears something that may be classified, his critical sense shuts off. You can see him quiver like a puppy dog.

--Keep him away from me, I want nothing to do with him. What is our testing status?

--We need more. As always. Classifying them has helped deflect criticism but we're still being nickel and dimed. [pg37]

--What do you need?

--An additional three hundred million over the next year.

--I will talk to the president. This is for Superbright?

--Yes. We can definitely show quantitative agreement with theory. It's only a matter of time and money. Philip will tell you how close we are. He and his new assistant have made tremendous headway, just tremendous.

--So? Tell me about this, my young friend.

--Well, I think it's premature to say so. There's a shot next Saturday. We'll know better than.

--Philip's too modest, that's always been his problem.

--No I just think we need a lot more

--More funding. Basically it's a matter of funding. In the long run we see coherent beams striking out a thousand miles and diverging no more than a meter. We see a single battle station downing every missile any enemy can launch. And Aron, we're also going ahead with your interceptors. As part of the overall system.

--Baldur?

--Smaller, faster, smarter, cheaper. Less than thirty billion to deploy.

--Even twenty years ago I thought that this idea only needed the technology to catch up. It is good we have a history, a tradition, a culture here.

--Like Ulysses, we're never at a loss.

--Really? Never at a

--Philip...

--Unless we're trying to produce a thousand mile beam where no test has ever shown

--Philip!

--Well how long do you think we can keep it up! this this

--As long as it takes.

--and you, Doctor Réti?

--My young friend, I am an optimist.

--Philip I want a word with you. Excuse us Aron. One arm clutched Quine in tight embrace and steered them into the hallway, Highet saying in low controlled tones, --One day soon, very soon, I'll stop [pg38] giving you second changes. Come up empty this time and you're through. Clear?

--Meaning what? You'll what?

--I don't know. I don't know but it will be terrible and final and I promise you'll never forget it. Highet raised his voice to hearty amiability, --Good man! You let me know, and went back into his office.

---

As night came on the life of the building went to X Section, the Playpen, where the younger men worked on schemes even more speculative than Superbright, and Quine returned for the thousandth time to his simulation with the sinking heart of a man returning to a loveless home. Entrapment. As if fine wire had threaded his drugged veins, and now, as feeling returned, any movement might tear him open. He fidgeted the radio on to, --fades to a reddish color as it enters Earth's shad, and off as he saw again the tilt of Nan's head, the fine whorls of her ear, the man's dark hand cupping her neck. The ridge of her collarbone, the warm pulse of the vein across it.

On Null's whiteboard deltas sigmas omegas integrals infinities in variegated ink still wove like fundamental forces their elegant pattern around a void. From the clutter on the desk he lifted CENTURY 21 LAB QUARTERLY. Changing world betokens larger role for science. Acceptable levels of social risk. Public does not fully understand. World free of threats too much to ask. Revolutionary new technique. Major improvement. Important to a variety of national goals. Unique multi-disciplinary expertise. Two young men, one poised to hurl a balloon, caromed past his doorway. He shut the door on guffaws and --teach you some hydrodynamics!

He picked up Black 1954. He looked at the citations, then read from the start. He stopped often to reread, with a doggedness that made shift for his halt sense, once so fine, of the rhythms of scientific thought, the probe and test and parry and clinch that now required his slow and remedial attention to be grasped. As he read, his respect for Thorpe grew even as an emptiness opened with him. When he was finished he started into space before reaching across the desk to snap off the lights.

The phone chattered. On the second ring he lifted it, holding [pg39] silence to ear for a moment before speaking. In the darkness the computer screen, phosphors charged by the room's vanished light, was a dim fading square.

--Quine.

--Hi, it's Lynn, I'm glad I caught you. I'm hiking up Mount Ohlone with some friends tonight, you want to come?

--Well...

--I know it's short notice.

--I should be working.

--Good heavens, all night? We're not starting till nine.

--No but... He scrutinized the whiteboard as if this quandary might be expressed there in double integrals. --I mean... sure, why not.

--Good! Meet us at the park gate. It's ten miles north on Crow Canyon Road.

In the hallway a length of surgical tubing, knotted at both ends, lay ruptured and limp in a film of water. As he left the building sprinklers came on in a silver mist and rainbows shimmered in the floodlit air. He drove out past parked vehicles and armed men in fatigues.

He arrived early. The sky was starry, the moon full. Some planet was setting in the west, probably Saturn by its color. The V of Taurus pointed back the way he'd come. A car approached, lights snagging in the trees, then came around the last bend lightless and rolled to a stop.

--Mark, Julie, this is Philip.

--Why're we whispering?

--Park's closed. Not supposed to be here.

They went around the closed gate and past a building set back among trees. In a second story window a dim line flickered, a fluorescent tube not on nor off, stuttering between states. Fifty yards further they left the road for a broad path that rose winding under black oak, then bay. An owl called, leaving the harbor of a eucalyptus.

Quine and Lynn walked in silence. Ahead Julie laughed and touched Mark's arm, not a lover's touch, but a gesture of intimacy with the world, the same hand caressing air and underbrush. They talked about people they knew, hes and shes darting in and out of audibility like moths in the dark. Soon they entered a darkness of [pg40] trees where nothing was visible but shards of the moon fallen like leaves around them. He went more slowly and stumbled. Lynn paused and he heard a rustling. Leaves popped free of a branch and came crushed under Quine's nose, carrying to him a strong waft of mint and resin.

--Sweet bay, she said, --is sacred to Apollo, but this is not [European bay](!Wikipedia "Bay Laurel"), _Laurens_, it's California bay, _[Umbellularia](!Wikipedia)_. Her tongue lingered on the liquids.

They kept climbing until they broke from the woods into an open slope. Moonlight rinsed palely the open range land below them.

--_[Artemisia tridentata](!Wikipedia)_, Lynn said, inhaling as she broke from a sagebrush a twig of gray leaves.

It was pungent in her cupped palm. The warmth of her came with it.

--Named for the goddess Artemis. Who loves it. And this is willow. _Salix_. _Los alamos_. Which is the meaning of Orpheus's name. Who opened doors he couldn't reenter.

--How do you know all this?

--This is where I grew up. This is the smell of my home. This is how I know I belong.

They came up to Mark and Julie at the edge of the grove. The moon hung above them, swollen, no goddess remontant but an airless world already mapped, trodden, and projected for division into satrapies of mining, manufacturing, and defense, occupancy deferred only until these scenarios could enrich their planners at a margin of return greater and more reliable than what current technology assured.

--Let's sit here.

Julie passed around bread, cheese, fruit, a plastic bottle of water. On the grass they sat eating. Somewhere crickets chirred on and off, their presence like a field of energy shifting.

--It's so warn tonight. Almost like summer.

--You from around here, Philip?

--I went to school in the East. I've been working around here for eight years.

--Practically a native. What do you do?

--I write software. [pg41]

--Friend of mine works for CodeWin, maybe you know him.

--It's a big industry.

--Bigger by the day, said Lynn dryly.

--Where's the Big Dipper? I can't see it, said Julie, standing.

--It's too low to see, said Quine. --That's the handle above the ridgeline. There in the west, that's Vega setting. A summer star. Winter coming in over there... pointing to that swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid, --The Pleiades. Also called the Seven Sisters. You can count more than seven on a clear night. But not with the moon out. And right behind them Orion, you can see him just coming over the horizon, those three stars in a line. Chasing them. Kind of a bad luck bunch, the Sisters. They were all seduced by one god or another, except for Merope, who married Sisyphus.

--Look! Is that a planet?

Finding the pale green disk where Julie pointed, a handsbreath from the Sisters, Quine knew it was the beam of a laser ten miles south stabbing to the edge of space where sodium atoms glowed in its heat.

--No, not a planet... Suddenly Lynn's hand was in his. She squeezed it once, and before he could respond released it to run downhill toward a dark grove. He stood for a moment and then he ran too. He ran for no reason he could name, wind in his ears, an excitement rising almost to fear in his heart, hackles alive. Some presence almost, chasing him. Then the darkness of the trees was around him and he tripped and went sprawling. The presence was still there. He feared it though he knew it was benign. It was not death, but it would change his life if he let it.

--Philip? Are you all right?

She stood over him, at the edge of the grove as Mark and Julie approached. He lay there in anxiety, anger almost at how she'd stirred him, at the beauty of her movement, at the way her features held the moonlight.

--Philip...?

--I'm fine. He brushed leaf dirt from his sleeves. The presence was gone. They walked in silence until emerging from the grove and heading downslope. Overhead the green star had vanished.

--So what are you working on now, Philip? [pg42]

--Oh... things in the sky, Quine said. --An aerospace partner wants us to program low orbit balloons a couple of miles across, the apparent size of the moon, sunlit, carrying messages, logos, advertising...

--But that's so, Julie began and Mark cut in, --Seems I read about this. The Sierra Club's bringing suit, aren't they?

--I don't know about that, we're just the contractors, I just do my job... and Julie glancing at Lynn claimed Mark's arm to move them away and resume in a low voice their conversation of hes and shes while Lynn walked apart, obliging Quine to follow, leaving behind --she sees him as a reclamation project... to overtake her on a knoll. She waited with crossed arms. Behind her, the valley was filled with glittering points. At its far verge was the floodlit terrain of the Lab.

--Philip, what are you doing?

--You don't like me as a software mogul?

--Is that your, your cover story? Her face remained still and fixed on him, moonshadow in her eyes' hollows.

--That balloon thing really is a Lab project, they started a small group on it...

--You don't want to tell them what you really do.

--No, I...

--You think Mark isn't smart enough to see through you? He is. You take his good faith for foolishness.

--Look I, I just didn't know what you told them. I didn't want you to be embarrassed by me. His face heated as he said it.

--Well, that would be my problem, wouldn't it. Now I have a different problem. Because it happens I did tell them. She waited for something he wasn't able to give her, then went on. --When you were talking about the Pleiades you were so, I don't know, at ease. What happened?

--Look, I'm sorry, I just... Another breath of warm breeze and he realized he was sweating.

--What happened?

--That green star we saw. It wasn't a star, it was something from the Lab. A laser test.

--A Radiance laser? [pg43]

--No... something else. Unclassified. A guide star for [adaptive optics](!Wikipedia).

She was listening with her arms still crossed. --Why did that change your mood?

--It's just, I'd almost forgotten, about everything except, except for being here. That thing in the sky reminded me. Then Mark asked what I did...

--They really have their hooks in you, don't they.

--I know that.

Face still hollowed in moonshadow she stepped toward him. His need to be touched and take comfort welled up, but some structure unknown yet dreadful held him still. After a moment's wait she turned to face the valley lights. --I'm surprised you haven't quit.

--And do what! Turn from the one place where my, my talents have some use?

--What do you want, Philip?

--Want? I don't know. I can't get it. I want eight years back. Before this I was a scientist.

--They haven't robbed you of that.

--Yes, that's so, I gave myself over, and now I'm on the line for something I don't care about. That's the way, yes, you're going to get screwed regardless, so you should make sure it's for something that matters to you...

--What would that be?

--I don't know.

Julie and Mark were calling. They went down the slope and rejoined them. She was still talking to Mark, --so I'm, wait, stop, this is it, these are the boundaries and he's like, what did I do? She turned to Lynn with the pack, --take this? and embraced Mark from behind, arms around his chest, straps of her shortlegged overalls a dark X on her back, bare calves duckwalking the pair down the slope.

In the lot Lynn said to Julie, --Get a ride with you guys?

Quine called out, --Mark, just joking about the balloon.

Mark looked up, fumbling with his keys, smiling. --Oh yeah?

--Thanks, thanks for, for inviting me. He got in the car, opened the glovebox, found a tablet, brushed lint from it, swallowed it dry. [pg44]

---

In his apartment was a smell like stale smoke and old sweat and rotting food, edged with something fouler, like the metallic stench of the flux from the open pipe. At first he thought it came from outside, where earlier they'd been roofing. But on the deck the air was fresh. He knelt to the carpet and smelled nothing. In the kitchen he bent to the drain and smelled nothing. From a bottle he squeezed a pearl of soap onto a sponge, ran hot water in the sink, scrubbed and rinsed it. He scrubbed the stove top. The ceiling fan was silted over by grease and spiderweb. He fetched a chair and reached to touch it. A black gobbet fell from it to the stove top. He fetched pliers and freed the nuts holding the shield, banging with the handle to break the dried paint around the rim. In both hands he bore the shield like a chalice to the sink.

In its concavities had pooled a glossy tar. He scrubbed it for minutes, smutch washing into the sink. Then he spooled off yards of paper toweling, wet and soaped it, and climbed the chair to wash over and again the sleeve of the fan, the blades, the hub. A viscous brown residue clung to the towels and his fingers. Further into the recess, beyond his reach, was more tar.

Sweat soaked him. He went onto the deck. The moon was dim and reddish, as if the sky held smoke. He stared in wonder and fear until the knowledge that it was an eclipse broke upon him banishing fear and wonder alike.

When he went back in the smell was waiting. He understood that from now on everything would smell like this. For a while he sat at the table with his eyes shut, then opened the newspaper for the memory of CARPETS CLEANED but it parted to 24 HRS OUTCALL DAWNA and LOVE TALK $2/MIN and he stared bleakly at the sullen pout, circleted forehead, hair as wild as if fresh risen from the sea, linen garb pleated in most subtle fashion. His hand found the telephone, and after a distant chirrup a small insinuating voice flicked like a tongue in his ear, and he stepped back from the uncradled receiver, switched off the lights, leaving the voice breathing unheeded into the darkness and the moonlight pooled on the floor.

He showered. In the seam lust swelled in him like nausea. Hot [pg45] spray lashed him. Incoherent images flashed upon him. Runnels nudged moonwhite globs toward the drain. Depleted he toweled. On the sink were Nan's toothpaste, hairbrush, lipstick, mascara. On the toilet tank an unzipped travel kit of quilted cotton gaped to show diaphragm, jelly, tampons, vitamins, ibuprofen, hairpins, barrette, lens wetter, a glass jar of face cream. A towelend snagged in the zipper as Quine scrubbed dry his hair, dragging the kit. Items hailed on the tile floor. He dropped the towel, then swept his hand across the sink top. He grabbed the kit and hurled it. The jar flew out an smashed against the wall. [pg46]

Dry sycamore leaves scraped over pavement in a hot wind drawn out from distant desert by a stalled offshore low. Over the ridge east of town dust and the smell of manure from the farmlands and a haze of smoke blew fitfully into the valley. as the sun rose through layers of haze Quine, driving to the back gate of the Lab so as to avoid the protesters, passed the dead vineyard by the north boundary. He pulled over, stilling the engine and the radio's --ty thousand acres ablaze.

The gate was closed but unlocked. A bright new sign bore the bio-hazard trefoil and DANGER TOXICS MITIGATION PILOT SITE ALPHA KEEP OUT. The drone of flies rose and fell like a turbine. Stunted vines clung to irrigation uprights. Bark from one sloughed like ash on his fingers. From deep in the vineyard a warm moist flatus perfused the air. A stink like the chyme of a dying beast. He ran back to the car choking and drooling. At an irrigation faucet he rinsed his mouth, his face, his hair, his hands, yet the foulness, as of corroded metal, lingered. What god loves this?

at Null's desk Thorpe worked.

--Bernd Dietz called. He has to know where to put the reflectors.

--I'm tempted to leave them where they were in the last shot.

--We can't do that, Highet would

--That's why I'm tempted.

--Yeah he's, he can be a real prick can't he.

--Not if you play by his rules. He always has a carrot handy.

--Well I have quite a few ideas but you need to look them over, sort [pg47] of tell me where they're out of line, you know we're really down to the wire here and

--Okay, let's assume Black's right...

--Oh then you've read

--Assume we're looking at quanta as localized particles guided by a physically real field...

--Highet, you know he really grilled me on this stuff when he came out to Utah, put me through the wringer, made me prove every assumption, but after an hour I had him convinced, and I thought he really respected...

--Typical Highet slap and stroke.

--Now suppose we...

--You're good at this. And very fast.

--Commercial software you know, those eighteen hour days tone you right up.

--No don't touch that, we can't change the rod array, I've already told Dietz.

--Can we reorient it?

--Maybe. I'll check.

Under Thorpe's shaping the model gradually began to show correlation. After several hours one run produced an annulus. Then nothing for hours more. Again the annulus. He rotated the model's rods again and again and at one angle power jumped and the annulus closed to a point. They stared at the screen. Thorpe bit his thumb. --What do you think?

--It looks all right.

--It looks fantastic. It's a hundred times brighter than the last shot. But the model's tweaked to hell and gone.

--I don't see anything wrong.

--No, neither do I. So now if we put the reflectors here... see, this is how I work. I'm not a theorist, I don't have your background, I need to, you know, immerse myself in the code, feel the system...

--Well, it's a remarkable job. I couldn't have done this. I've tried for months.

--Well, I couldn't have done it if your code wasn't so comprehensive [pg48]. You really worked at this. But it's, you know, at some level it's all just sort of pushing numbers around. I don't know if it's saying anything real.

--We'll know soon enough.

--Do you think something's wrong?

Quine shrugged. --Nothing I can see.

--You're not convinced.

--I don't have to be. It's what Highet wants, isn't it?

--Yeah but, that's not what you think I'm doing, is it?

--No...

--Because I would never do that.

--I'm sure you

--Since the Fish and Himmelhoch thing I have to be very careful. They were crucified, just crucified, they're pariahs, their careers are finished. Anything remotely to do with cold fusion is tainted, you may as well say you're working on perpetual motion. And I was on that team, I was in that lab. So I have to be very careful.

--Perpetual motion, you could probably sell that to Highet. At least as a talking point.

--It's not funny to me. I had nothing to do with that debacle, just so we're clear on that.

--Sure. I understand.

--Sorry I'm touchy. Just, you know, tired. You've been generous, letting me work with your code and all, I really thought you'd stick me with the scut work but you've done it haven't you, all the test details, and let me do the interesting part. This could take me a long way and I'm grateful.

--Why don't you go home, get some sleep?

--Yeah, okay, I'm whipped.

--Take tomorrow off. I'll tell Highet.

--No no, I'll be in. We have to write up a work order.

--I'll do it, don't worry about it.

--Are you staying?

--God no, what is it, midnight?

--It's, oh Jesus, it's two a m.

--No, I'm leaving in five minutes. I'll write the work order tomorrow. [pg49]

--Oh I meant to, here's something else for you to read... and, hesitating a moment, Thorpe placed a stapled xerox on Quine's stack, held his gaze for a moment, and departed.

It was a new paper by Sorokin. At [CERN](!Wikipedia) now. Quine skimmed it as if reading news from a distant galaxy or a remote epoch. It solidified and extended the work they'd done together, the experiment that had separated them. It was clear that it was a field now, and that Sorokin owned it. He stanched an upwelling of envy and selfpity.

But instead of going home Quine broke apart Thorpe's code and studied the changes. He gave the model a new set of energies: points clustered around the focus. Again, with different energies, the same focus emerged. Something was wrong, he could smell it; his instinct was not yet dead.

Near dawn he found it. Along with the sensor positions, Thorpe had tweaked the sensor response function. Playing the system, as he said, to get results. But now the function emphasized certain wavelengths. As might the sensors themselves when struck by the bomb's radiation. The brightness from the earlier tests might be nothing but reflection, instrument error. When you put that error into the focusing code, the code naturally confirmed the data. Glue in a house of cards. And down in a corner of Null's whiteboard, half erased, was it? yes, the same function, the same tweak. There in the corner of his eye for months. Wasted months. Wrong from the start. Error or fraud? No way to know. Maybe started as one, became the other. But wait now. If you removed the tweak, if you stopped trying for a beam, chaff fell from the problem and the expressions said something else entirely.

A presence entered the room. Air gravid and light adance. There appeared to his mind's eye the battle station lost and insignificant in a tide of radiance, all the universe's light at wavelengths and colors beyond mere vision, streaming in intricate brocade, weaving and mediating between matter and energy, wave and particle, the phenomenal and the [noumenal](!Wikipedia). Here was the mystery, at last, open for his knowing as he hovered between fatigue and ecstasy, and he knew he was unready to pass through the gate of revelation into this realm of light. He drew back. And the presence like a roebuck in forest startled [pg50] and was gone. The tide of light receded. He was left with only the particulars of rods and reflectors. But he had found their flaw. Mystery might elude, but the information was sure. Thus angels must feel, radiant with the certainty that flows from their single devotion to right.

---

--Bernd, I need some reflectors.

--For Taliesin.

--Yes.

--I know, I have a work order already, this morning, from Thorpe.

--No, I need more.

--We do not have time to add

--I have to have reflectors made of something other than beryllium.

Dietz was silent. He began leafing through a logbook. --Do you know, try as we might we cannot keep traces of oxygen out of the beryllium. I have told Highet this. Long ago.

--Really.

--I have proposed hydrogen in the past.

--Why haven't we tried it?

--"Don't mess with success."

--I see. I'd like to try it.

--Does Highet approve?

--I'll take responsibility.

--Without his approval I can do nothing.

--Bernd. This is what Slater thought, isn't it. That the beryllium reflectors were giving false brightness. And Null knew it too, didn't he.

--I did not see Slater's report. Dietz did not look up from the book.

--Make some hydrogen reflectors for me. Cable them separately from the beryllium.

Dietz shut the book. --Send me a work order. I will have to send a copy to Highet.

Kihara came through the doors with a following of suited men.

--Won't be a minute gentlemen, don't let us disturb you, you can see here the precision engineering we're capable of, bang-up job of inventiveness, maximum return on investment, the answer to reversing the balance of trade deficit, innovative federally generated technology transfer to industry, improves the nation's economic competitiveness [pg51] as we work deliberately and consciously to build partnerships, a new class of information with commercial value, very creative cooperative efforts, freedom to negotiate intellectual property rights, fees and royalties, cover the technological waterfront, take for instance these fine-grained [superplastic](!Wikipedia) steels, not to mention [x-ray lithography](!Wikipedia)... and Quine returned to his office rummaging through CENTURY 21, Rings Fields and Groups, Computer Addict Wholesale Microcenter, [TeX](!Wikipedia) Technical Reference, to come up on WORK ORDER Form 4439A Authorized Use Only, and sat for a minute holding a pen above it suddenly frozen at the sound of Thorpe's approaching voice, --you have to invoke the world control option from the [command line](!Wikipedia), relaxing as the voice receded, pen moving to spell SECONDARY SENSOR ARRAY.

---

From Highet's open door he heard, --You want less pressure, try the [Institute for Advanced Salaries](!Wikipedia "Institute for Advanced Study")[^IAS], it's a fucking retirement village for the reality-impaired! and a lower voice unintelligible in response, then --I don't care, I want results! the lower voice growing sharper, --is cheap. My people have to make it happen, as the door opened and Dietz, pale and shaking, came out past Quine glancing at him without a word and stormed down the hall, Highet following to the door, calling out, --A beard without a mustache, does that make you an honest man? and to Quine, --You. I don't want to talk to you now. Send me e-mail.

[^IAS]: The IAS has from its founding been criticized despite hosting luminaries like Einstein & Goedel, and von Neumann when building early computers. The quotes by Nobelists Richard Hamming & Feynman in the Wikipedia article are representative.

--I think you'll want to hear this. We can show quantitative agreement.

Highet looked at him with loathing. --You want to change the reflectors. The day before the shot.

--I want to try hydrogen.

--That's an incredibly bad idea, that's totally braindead^[A favorite epithet of Lowell Wood's, according to Blum 1988.], to introduce a new measurement technique at this stage. You have to calibrate, you have to

--If Slater's right, if the beryllium shows false brightness, it's only a matter of time until we know it. It might as well be now. Or do you want to spend another fifty million on another shot?

--I'd love to. Who told you Slater said that?

--It's common knowledge. We'll have to address the issue eventually. [pg52]

--Common knowledge my ass.

--Then it might be wise to preempt questions about it. The shot's so close to the presentation, we can't be expected to have data that quickly. but we could say we're investigating. If we have to.

--You're sure about the quantitative agreement?

--The simulation's excellent. I won't take credit for it. Jef Thorpe did the work.

--Did he know. Well, we're a team. Good results show good management.

--I'd like Jef to give the presentation.

Highet's eyes fixed in calculation on Quine as the phone rang and Quine waited for the dismissive wave with which Highet ended audiences, but instead he spoke a moment, then covered the mouthpiece and said, --Want to make some money Philip, Devon Null's taking on investors, and uncovering the mouthpiece, --Yes, application's outside the envelope no problem there, keep me brief, and in another moment hung up, leaning back and clasping his hands over his thinning crown, gazing at the ceiling.

--Well that's fine, that's very fine. Wonder if we could work up a little something. I could invite some key people to the ranch for the shot, some unnamed sources, goose the process a little, can we get Thorpe in on this?

--He's probably in my office.

--You may work out yet Philip, Highet grudged as one thick finger stabbed the phone. --Jef? Leo. Get over here, rising to pace past framed and signed photos of three Presidents, another of Réti and himself with the current President, artist's rendering of the Superbright and of a fusion driven spaceship, cartoon of a mushroom cloud WHEN YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SEND THE VERY BEST, certificates from professional societies, a length of cable, a circuit board. He stopped at the window, gaze caught by something, and parted the vertical slats of the blind with his fingers, speaking softly, almost to himself.

--Do you know the darkness that's out there? Do you realize how tenuous this all is? Twenty thousand years of civilization, and only in the last few hundred has rationality begun to displace superstition. I tell you I would sup with the devil, I would risk armageddon, not to [pg53] lose that. When I think of those fucking tree huggers out there... and turning back to Quine, voice low and insistent, --Think the ills are in a system, think it's that simple, Réti and his anticommunism, your new girlfriend and her peacenik buddies, wonder why's she drawn to you?

--Now wait just a

--Darkness and malady is in the human heart, Philip, don't you know that? The enemy is the heart. You can't hide from that darkness ...as Thorpe entered in black linen jacket, red t-shirt, nose stud, eyes eager, and Highet's demeanor switched to the cheerful, --Jef, my man. I want to wow the rubes when we go to the desert. We have a ranch out there with [T3](!Wikipedia "Digital Signal 3") data lines from the test site. What can you do that's portable and fantastic? I want flash that makes you reach for your checkbook.

--I've got an interface toolkit from my CodeWin days, I can throw something together. Just tell me what kind of data I have to work with.

--I'll email you the details. Shot's tomorrow evening, not too much for you, is it?

--Demo or die, I know the drill, said Thorpe, grinning.

---

The evening wind whipped dust across the highway, vibrating the cars stopped in three lanes behind flashing lights at Codornices EXIT NLY as Quine punched --illion in property loss, over to --noninjury accident being cleared at the Codornices Road exit not blocking lanes for you, drowned in a siren blaring up the shoulder OHLONE VALLEY RESCUE ƎƆИA⅃UᙠMA as Quine edged against horns and unheard curses into the exit lane and cut back onto a commercial strip behind the central mall, the reverse of which colonnaded and pedimented facade, its raw concrete stained by rains, aught with a sort of wounded dignity the sun's last rays as they likewise gilded Estancia Estates An Adult Community where Quine parked and for a moment held in his gaze a prospect of identical bungalows arrayed on lawns billiard-green out to the surveyed boundaries of chainlink and dry pasture beyond.

--Oh! Philip. Come in. I wasn't expecting you, your deadline...

--Well it's Friday night, I thought

--I'm glad you, but, if you'd called I would have made dinner... [pg54]

--I wasn't sure I was coming.

--Your work is done?

--There's a test. I fly out tomorrow afternoon. And there's a presentation Monday.

--Can you stay tonight? We can go out for... is something wrong?

--I need to ask you something.

--Yes? What is it?

--Who's the guy with the curly black hair and the good tan?

--The, what?

--I happened to see you the other day. In a hallway. He was acting kind of proprietary.

--Proprie, her face flushed and she turned to look across the room, one hand resting on a table. Quine waited.

--How long has this been going on?

--His name's Ben and he's a good friend, and it's been, we've been friends for years. Since before I knew you.

--You still see him?

The flush darkened, and as she turned back to him her mild features contorted into a stiff anger he'd never seen in her. --Do you mean, do I sleep with him? Yes. I have. Once or twice since you and I have been together.

--Once or twice. You've lost count.

--Oh, Philip! Why are you, this is hateful!

--It hurts me, Nan.

Her face was a mask of plain misery. --We never

--Never what, laid down rules? I didn't think we had to, I thought some things went without saying.

--Without saying what! That I'm yours alone when you don't give me anything, for God's sake Philip I didn't turn to Ben for sex, just for, for kindness, for friendship, just to feel that I mattered! To Someone! Five years of my life Philip, I'm no longer a young woman, do you want to know when it was I saw Ben, when I went to him after you and I were together?

The coldness, the absolute coldness of the moment.

--You don't, you don't even care do you. It hurts you, but I can see in your eyes, you won't listen to me. How can I possibly explain when [pg55] you won't even give me credit for, for living you, Philip? When you and I met, at that picnic, and I was so charmed by you, by your intelligence, your modesty, your reserve. Do you remember, the thunderstorm? I hadn't seen one since moving West. And afterwards you took me home, we were drenched, and I loaned you clothes. Oh Philip, it was long over between Ben and me, he was like a brother, I just wanted to say goodbye, to tell someone close to me how happy I was. How happy I thought I'd be.

--And the second time?

--Yes, that's all you want to hear. Two years later, when you didn't come to dinner, didn't call, and I waited and waited, so it was only an anniversary just a date on the calendar that's all, but I called Ben and he came over to be with me, and he didn't, didn't even want... cut off by her sobs.

--But I, you know I was working, you could have

--When you come here and, and sulk for hours, barely acknowledge my existence, don't call for days on end, then expect, how do you think that makes me feel... I would have told you about Ben if you' asked if you'd ever shown any interest at all. If you even know who I am!

Within him a stone fell and fell, soundlessly turning.

--Philip, talk to me! Don't turn away like this!

--I have nothing to say, and he was out the door, where streetlights had come on, knowing that his leaving now was worse than anything gone before, a withdrawal he could never make right. Don't tell me, don't tell me we don't feed the emptiness in each other. [pg56]

### Five

In the [Great Basin](!Wikipedia) of Nevada thousands of acres of waste and infecund desert had been reclaimed for science as the Aguas Secas Weapons Test Site^[The [Nevada National Security Site](!Wikipedia)?], and one hundred miles further west was the Advanced Research Institute of the Eastern Sierra, a ranch at the edge of the [Owens Valley](!Wikipedia), a black facility whose funding appeared in no budget. Leased to the government by a conservative businessman, it served as a layover site for Lab personnel on their way to the desert. It nestled in the broad base of a canyon near a creek's loud runoff through lateral [moraine](!Wikipedia). To the west the ground rose in the space of a few miles from six thousand feet to a twelve thousand foot crest of granite crags. Below, a few miles to the east, the north-south highway lay like a dropped ribbon across the wrinkled valley floor, and a hundred miles further across desert dotted with sage under a flotilla of thunderheads was the chalk white sink of Aguas Secas.

Even before joining the Lab Quine had seen ARIES. On his first trip west, while switching planes at Phoenix, he'd been paged and diverted to a single engine craft bound for a Kern County airstrip, where a sheriff's four by four awaited him. The first Radiance shot had just gone off and at the ranch they were celebrating. Quine met Highet there. Highet was beating a twelve year old at chess, telling the boy, I'll trade a bishop for a knight anytime, I love knights, they leap barriers, they face eight ways at once.

A month later Quine was at Aguas. Rank smell of sage hovered in the predawn cool, immensities of desert air quivered to the horizon. [pg57] They drove with the sun rising behind them, the young initiates joking, group leaders and guards and observers in [DoD](!Wikipedia "Department of Defense") hardhats silent and grim. Roadways of cables led from instrument trailers over desert pocked with the collapse craters of previous tests to the distant borehole. Above it a red crane pointed straight up. The count reached zero. And the earth rippled. A wave rushed toward them and the ground shook as if a train were passing and passing and passing. When it stopped the air was a clear plasma of exaltation. To know that the binding forces of matter were yours to break, the wealth of nations yours to squander in such sublime force, this was a deep and secret sweetness known only to the few.

At the ranch now Thorpe was joking with some grad students from X Section. Others were there from J Section, and some stern faces he didn't know, military or intelligence, and Steradian alert as a corrupt deputy. Highet arrived in blue jeans and tooled leather boots, carrying cases of soda, chanting in a false twang, --Twaace the sugar, twaace the caffeine... followed by a Western senator cadaverous and grinning in white Stetson, and his young aide plump and groomed to a sheen, with the zealous black eyes of a pullet^["A young hen, esp. one less than one year old."].

--Look at em, young, brilliant, confident, said the senator. --That's how I felt at their age. They own the world.

--The world? retorted Highet. --They own their genitals. The rest of them's mine, raising his voice to introduce, --Gentlemen, the right honorable Howard Bangerter of Utah...

The aide asked if physics had yet succeeded in finding in the traces of Creation the fingerprints of God, and Highet nodded, a slow smile spreading and his tonguetip darting as his hands rose to conjure, --Not God exactly... as Quine walked onto the deck where three barbecue grills sizzled, and a keg of COORS LITE sat amid greasy paper plates bearing the ruins of meals, and the sun had long since chased the wandering moon, itself pursuing Venus, behind the mountain wall. Although the sky retained day's blue a chill came down from the remote and snowless peaks.

--This young man, Highet's voice carried out from within, won last year's Heinrich Hertz Fellowship in Physics, a prestigious award I happen to administer... and Quine stepped down from the deck, crossing [pg58] dry grass to the creek's rockstrewn willowed bank where it trickled through small pools and clumps of rotting leaves. Quine followed it upward, breath laboring. He stopped at a large boulder long ago tumbled from a higher place, and sat. Little residue of the day's warmth remained in the shadowed stone. The western ridge above him was a great dark wave. In the east a glamour of rosetint clouds swept up from the horizon. The ranch was small below him. A cold wind came down the great wall of rock. Into this wilderness he might ascend and be lost.

But he returned. Thorpe's voice came up as he slid open the glass doors, --background, you know, trucks on the highway, that sort of thing. Other side of the spool you can see some small tremblors we had this afternoon. When the shot goes off we'll see more than a wiggle. But the real action's on this screen here. At the site they're recording everything for later analysis but data's also piped to this workstation where this autocorrelation software gives us an immediate window on what's happening. Red is intense energy, blue is, you know, less intense. We're looking for sort of a red ringlike structure.

Quine watched the stylus quiver as about him others conversed. Without warning the stylus jerked. The screen of the workstation came to life, numbers flowing down its right edge. Colors coalesced on screen. The senator and his aide leaned in enrapt. A minute passed. Blue and green surrounded a corona of yellow and a jagged red core flecked with white.

--We have brightness, Thorpe said. --A hundred times the last test. More. Could be a thousand times.

--Three orders of magnitude improvement, declared Highet. --At this rate we'll have every enemy missile on Earth neutralized in a few years, and raising his tone with his glass, --To Team Superbright! Leonardos of the age. You people are the best in the world.

Grunts and howls of triumphs went off like rockets. The senator's aide leaned smiling to whisper in the senator's ear.

A second wave of guests arrived, a dozen men in suits adorned with MAMMOTH CONVENTION CENTER NAME COMPANY and a few women packaged as brightly as new software, and Quine moved off through the manic younger men hopped up by caffeine and sugar and the shot. [pg59]

Quine edged into a hallway and down a narrow flight of stairs as behind him music began pounding, catching as he turned a last glimpse of Thorpe, cheeks flushed, smiling at a circle of admirers the impartial smile of triumph.

<!-- TODO -->

*Nature is more ready in her creating than Time in his destroying, and so she has ordained that many animals shall be food for each other.*

He continued downstairs toward a light. In the cellar seven or eight young men from X Section were gathered around an old rackmounted minicomputer and a pooltable.

--so he goes, learn to hassle people and lie with a straight face.

--Excuse me, I need to get back. Does anyone know the arrangements?

--Excellent advice, dude.

--Excuse

One glanced up. --There's pool cars outside somewhere.

Full dark. A dozen cars. E108637. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICIAL USE ONLY. Key in the column. The seat harness slid up an drew in over his chest and waist as a chime sounded and dash lights blinked red then glowed teal. The car swayed and bounced for a mile down the dirt road. There the highway stretched north and south into void, under stars like chips of ice. He could go anywhere. But time was a field that moved with him, inescapable, close as the blue light in the cabin. He drove for hours without stopping, radio for company, wash of noise, hollowness in his being. Mountains that a century ago killed emigrants with their rigors fell to his vehicle. Descending to the flats he saw brushfires crawling on far ridges like luminous cells writing some [teratogenic](!Wikipedia) message across the land, and the farm cities on the ancient seabed added their sulfurous light at the meetings of capillary highways glowing with the heat of a summer long past its term, [pg62] and booming through the car's windows when he opened them was the smell of dust, manure, smoke, exhaust, chemicals, and he crossed the last ridge into his valley of a million souls, of all the places he might go, for all the freedom he had, here again.

In the dark apartment he stripped, dropping rank clothes behind him on the way to the bathroom. The mirror's sudden light showed, before selfhood interposed its protective assurance, the face of a stranger, aging and vulnerable. Lowering his eyes from the brightness he stood voiding for long seconds. A ribbon of urine twisted along the axis of its arc as it splashed into the bowel. Standing thus he blinked, faded, woke. The gates of sleep stood open and he was through them, uncleansed, as soon as he lay down. [pg63]

### Six

Gathered before dawn the crowd set out for the main gate, to be met by police as later arrivals swelled it further, until Lab workers began to show up in their vehicles and county and city police were called to divert traffic to the north gate against the columns of people still coming, and the south road was closed to vehicles and state police summoned, and still the spectacle slowed to walking speed, so that Quine was late to Highet's office. Highet stared out his window at the south road.

--Those people out there will never understand. It could be so much worse. On the other side, [entire cities](!Wikipedia "Closed city"), entire regions have no civilian industry at all, it's all military. Here we cut our deals as needed but we still do real science. We bring in people like you. We roll back the darkness.

--There's a problem.

Highet turned. --What.

--The beryllium and hydrogen reflectors were cabled separately. Thorpe's analysis at the ranch used only the beryllium. I looked at the hydrogen data yesterday. Nothing. No brightness. No beam.

Highet turned again to the window. --I see. The hydrogen reflectors which I asked you not to use. You know, I almost stopped that work order, came that close. But I wanted to see what you had in mind.

--As supervisor it was my decision.

--Yes it was. So where's your quantitative agreement now?

--You saw at the ranch. The beryllium shows it. Spectrum peaks here, as predicted. But that's not an x-ray, that's oxygen in the beryllium [pg64] glowing at just the right wavelength. It looks exactly like the new model's predictions for focus.

--And where did this new model come from?

--Thorpe has been modifying my code. I found a routine of his where just this set of frequencies is amplified.

Highet came from the window, pacing past the photos of Presidents and artists' renderings, touching the length of cable.

--So it's all Thorpe's fault! That's your story?

--The CASE system shows all his modifications.

--I see. Well, it's bad for him, then. Especially after Fish and Himmelhoch. He has a history.

--I wouldn't call it intentional. The ideas he brought were good. I worked with him, I didn't see this, it could have happened to anyone.

--It doesn't matter. He has a history, voice sharpening, --quackery or carelessness, you think it matters? You think you can ever walk away from your history?

Quine said nothing.

--Now those hydrogen reflectors, let's talk about these, you piggybacked your own little test onto the piggyback, that was very cute. Did Thorpe know about that?

--You saw the work orders.

--He knew he was getting feed from the beryllium only?

--It was his demo.

--Yes, you saw to that. All right. We'll keep him on for a while. Then you'll write him a letter of recommendation. Down the road we'll issue a report on the false brightness. You'll be group leader on that.

--You want me to...

Highet's voice was tight with controlled fury. --I want you to take some responsibility. Show you're serious about this. It's about time you moved up or got out.

--Okay.

--You begin to interest me, Philip. I thought I knew what to expect from you.

--At least we caught this now.

--Okay. I listened to your story. Now you listen to me. We haven't caught a thing yet. What we need now is another test. [pg65]

--I don't want to sound naive, but you're not going to mention this at the presentation?

--Today? I think not. I think I will not at this moment give the enemies of reason grounds sufficient to bury our project, our knowledge, our aspirations. Highet lifted from his desk a small device etched with a craft undreamed of even a decade before, raising it before him like a talisman, weighing it in his hand. --I believe not.

Nolan came through the door bearing a red folder, acknowledged Quine with a minute change of expression, as the phone rang and Highet lifted it, --No I can't see anyone right now.

--Very clean data from your shot, Philip, Nolan said.

--no damn it I can't Chase is coming in an hour

--Oh, you've seen it?

--what, what do you mean he's here now

--We prepared the overheads. A match with theory unparalleled since Mendel's peas.^[See previous mention of Mendel for the dramatic irony here.] Kid's a barn burner is he?

--well damn it keep him down there

--He'd like to be.

--fucking hero of the people can just wait

--You're taking him under your wing.

--don't care! Do whatever it takes! Have to do everyone's job, what's this Bran?

--Overheads of the Taliesin data.

--Fine, leave them. Bernd there you are find the rest of the team will you get them up where we have a little problem god damn senator arrived just a little ahead of schedule he's downsta, Dennis where the hell have you b... Nolan--!

--Oh! I just, sorry, didn't see your foot

--Sorry Dennis let me help you up...

--Nolan will you get the hell

--my slides! here don't step on

--Nolan!

--just put these back in order, with the ah integrated [24-bit color](!Wikipedia) [TGIF](!Wikipedia "Tgif (program)") animations and music in standard [MIDI](!Wikipedia) files

--Dennis

--little problem with the synthesizer all the instruments stuck on [pg66] the [cowbell](!Wikipedia) patch so when we played the Apocalypse Now music, I mean the Wagner Valk, rather intriguing actually but hardly

--Dennis will you

--then our [Silicon Graphics](!Wikipedia) machine couldn't read the TGIFs so we had to convert them to Video [PostScript](!Wikipedia) but somehow they came out black and white one inch square so

--Dennis will you please

--go low tech instead, keep it simple, four synchronized [slide projectors](!Wikipedia) overheads [eight track digital tape](!Wikipedia)

--Dennis, get up! Leave the, will you leave the slides on the floor. Go to the lobby. Keep Senator Chase busy down there.

--But I

--Go! and pacing to the window, parting the blind, --Fuck's this going to play like, must be hundreds of them in the road.

--The news said a thousand, said Dietz.

--Bullshit. Supposed to keep these assholes away from the main gate put them up in the north corner, I want to know how word of this got out! glaring at Quine, --I want to know who's been talking to these people, who let them know Chase was coming today. Who do we have out there? Federal protective, local police, I want county I want the [Chippies](!Wikipedia "California Highway Patrol"), bring out the goddamn transit cops if we have to!

--Leo, it's symbolic. Today's [Armistice Day](!Wikipedia), you know?

--Shit on that, it's to embarrass us. All for Chase. Man keeps calling me up about twenty kilos of plutonium gone missing^[In 2000, as part of the [Cerro Grande Fire](!Wikipedia), Los Alamos discovered that up to 20kg of plutonium were being stored in a random shed, apparently before heading to the dump.], I keep telling him we don't stockpile plutonium here.

--But we do, Leo.

--Well, Bernd, Chase doesn't have the clearance to know that, and picking up the phone midring, --Yes? Damn it Dennis just, look, take him to the downstairs conference room think you can do that? ...no will you forget the fucking slides, thumbing the phone's button, -- Where's Szabo? You all go down, I'm right behind you.

--Senator, glad you could make. This all? Expected to see more of your colleagues...

--Doctor Highet. These two gentlemen are from the [General Accounting Office](!Wikipedia). You'll be seeing more of them. [pg67]

--Why don't you all take a seat and we'll being.

--I have just one question, Doctor Highet. Is the Superbright going to work?

--I believe our presentation will address any

--I don't want a presentation, I want a yes or no. At the present moment, judging from everything you have to date, is it a viable system, within the budget and timeframe we have?

--Beyond question. In fact we have new results that show

--A new Superbright test? When?

--I can't discuss that in open session.

--Then maybe you can discuss claims of exaggeration and fraud from Warren Slater.

--Those are lies. Slater sabotaged my teams repeatedly. He had reasons of his own to derail this program.

--Such as?

--I can't discuss that in open session.

--Slater's not the only critic. Some of your own people

--Those are not my people. Those are people who've made up their minds that certain technical problems are too hard to solve. They're wrong. They could be making a contribution, but instead they find fault.

--So why are you behind schedule?

--We're not.

--According to your own timetable

--Senator, we have brilliant, creative people together here doing important work. Leave them alone and they accomplish miracles. But if you put limits on them...

--You're not answering me. I didn't ask about miracles.

--I am answering you if you'll let me. You cannot nickel and dime a program like this in the research phase, not if you exp

--Research? I thought you were engineering phase.

--Very nearly.

--You sent the president a letter claiming engineering phase.

--I do not acknowledge that. If such a letter were to exist it would be top secret, and you lack the clearance to see it or the competence to evaluate it. [pg68]

--Doctor Highet I'm tired of this, you have put in motion a program that all told has squandered thirty billio

--Senator

--you have stonewalled, you have defied

--Senator

--gress, you have hidden behind classifica

--Senator, you're an asshole. You might even be a traitor.

--I will not take that from you, sir!

--You don't have a clue what's at stake here, one look at those hippies out front you're ready to cave, sell out this nation's security its technological edge its, breaking off for the figure in the doorway who bowed his head in apology.

--Gentlemen, we have a bomb threat. We need to clear the building.

--Good God.

--Your peacenik constituents, Chase. Good work.

--I'm not through with you, Highet.

--Fine, I'm willing to sit right here play Russian roulette.

--Gentlemen please, security is coming through, you'll have to move to Building 101.

Clipped static blurted in the hallway. Gallop of many feet approached.

--Clear this area!

<!-- TODO -->

Outside in the sunlight a security squad came running in a wedge, helmeted and visored, black gloves holding batons at port arms. Leather creaking, heels clattering, radios jabbering, they broke through the exiting crowd and Quine was swept the wrong way, out past an unmanned checkpoint before he cleared the surge of people onto a lawn where men in jumpsuits trailed strips of CAUTION tape on two then three sides of him and he dashed through the open space as behind him shouts were raised. Between windowless walls he took a stairway down to where two workmen rounding a corner dealt him a blow with the plank they carried, --Jesus watch it! hurling him to his knees against a chainlink fence trembling at the lip of a great pit. In this excavation five, seven, ten vehicles labored grinding and roaring in desperate intensity, beeping hollowly as they reversed or clanking furiously forward over a terrain of pale mud. Vast as the pit was it would not bury a millionth of the dead the bombs could kill. Quine [pg69] pulled free of the fence with a tearing of fabric and went over a walkway of plywood sheets, pausing before a trailer CREDNE CONSTRUCTION in which doorway two t-shirted men eating lunch regarded him with dispassion as with a handkerchief he rubbed dirt and blood from his palms and the knee visible through ripped pants, then went down another stair of raw wood stained with mud, glancing back at concentric terraces gouged from the hillside. *The city is built on two levels, lords and palaces above, common workers below.* He rounded a corner to where a stream of people hurried past guards at a checkpoint.

--Look I need to

--Move on, there's been a bomb threat.

--Yes but I'm in an important meeting I need to get back to

--You can't come this way, this is a secure area.

--I'm cleared dammit! clapping his breast where no photo ID, but a torn flap of pocket depended, --oh Christ, look my name's Philip Quine can't you call

--Move away! The guard shoved him back into a stream of people advancing slowly toward the main gate. He made his way through and broke into a job on a path that led to the perimeter road, where he doubled back to the entry kiosk from its far side passing and passing close on his left the unending mass of protesters just beyond the fence. He stopped short of the entrance gate where cars were blocked by the leading edge of the crowd coursing out and around them like a stream around rocks, while bullhorns blared --personnel, do not exit by this gate repeat do not, and outside the gate protesters swirled in place like debris at a confluence of cataracts, held back by a skirmish line of country police vainly trying to keep them separate from Lab personnel. Quine stood sweating and panting until four cars slewed to a stop on the perimeter road and discharged Lab security, one of whom leveled his club at Quine, not clearly part of either crowd, and cried, --You!

Quine ran for the kiosk. More Lab police had arrived there, forming a wedge to divert Lab personnel from the gate. Quine was suddenly before two of them who linked arms to bar his passage. Their visors, opaque and bronze, mirrored twin Quines, elongated and dismayed. He pointed past them. [pg70]

--I belong inside.

Then he was seized and pushed through the gate into the street. A helicopter swept overhead. He crouched under its roar, hands against his ears.

<!-- TODO -->

*Let us now speak the truth as we know it. Say that the sun is round, and bright, and hot. Say that it fires its acolytes, darkens their skins, elevates their wormridden souls. It rises in our birth and it sets in our death. Its prints upon our flesh the spots that adorn its face. It is in us whether we labor under it, or hide away from it. It strikes through our souls, it ignites the light of our being, it limns the shadow of our denial.*

In the crowd he saw Lynn, her dark head appearing and vanishing among others, nape and shoulders bare and tanned below the cropped marge of hair, sun blazing on the straps and back of a white top.

<!-- TODO -->

*Light is a wave and we are carried upon it. Light is a particle to pierce us with revelation. Light is the sun or the moon, a heat that tempers or a gentleness that silvers with love.*

He pushed toward her. At the end of its circuit the helicopter turned and came again.

<!-- TODO -->

*Say what you know, that love is lost. That light is extinguished. But see, loveless our souls still blaze. Our sun has not gone out, for fire comes to those who go not the way of light. See, we blaze and are not consumed.

He called her name and the call was lost in noise. The crowd shoved them together and she turned to him, eyes surprised. It was not Lynn. Pressed by the crowd they unwillingly embraced. He clung to her until another surge felled him. The cut on his knees opened and he bent to stanch it. When he rose he was among figures wearing skulls of papier-mâché and skeletons painted on black tights. Tambourines jangled, clattered. Around him people tied kerchiefs over their faces. The helicopter roared. Its belly glistened like a spider's, then it rocked and moved off leaving a silver mist that fell gently onto the crowd like a spring rain. Tears leapt to Quine's face and he dropped to his knees gasping and blinded, clinging to the nearest figure, saying over and over, --I belong inside. [pg71]

## II. Dual Use

[pg73] Past the toll plaza the bridge stretched into morning fog and low clouds that obscured bay and sky alike until the center span climbed out of this gray limbo into a brilliant haze through which sun smote the driver's window and curdled the horizons to brown smutch, while a jet poised like a raptor overhead and thundered in falling [glissandi](!Wikipedia) as Highet pressed A/C MAX and turned up the radio to, --first day of spring in the Bay Area record highs expect, punching over to the orotund tones of, --Great American Broadcasting network, your host [Tuck Eubanks](!Wikipedia "Rush Limbaugh") ladies and gentlemen, the conservative voice of truth, prosperity, and fun, back in a moment, and hurtled down the span's far side through Redwood City where the only trees to be seen were blue gum eucalyptus and sycamore, past Your Company Name Here 415-282-0110 and SINATRA 4th Show Added Mar 31, tapping the brake as taillights reddened in all lanes ahead, swerving from behind SQUANDR to thread between [386SX](!Wikipedia "Intel 80386") and [FOOBAR](!Wikipedia), punching the radio to --[clones](!Wikipedia "Macintosh clone") lowest prices guaranteed at Computer Addict Sunnyvale, downshifting to third then second as Versant, Data General, Hexcel, Informix, and Failure Analysis Associates went by, cutting in front of [ELUESIS](!Wikipedia "Eleusinian Mysteries") to brake sharply under a small black billboard in white [Futura](!Wikipedia "Futura (typeface)") italic SAVE US FROM WHAT WE WANT as the radio continued, --[Caltrans](!Wikipedia) hazmat team on the scene 101 southbound at Moffett three lanes closed, and stabbing the selector again, as if a more congenial reality awaited on another channel, --my friends, I am expounding and commenting on a cultural decay happening in this [pg74] culture, his hand traveling on to pick up the cellular phone, --Dan Root^[In the popular 1999 novel _Cryptonomicon_ which deals with many technology themes, a mysterious & major character is similarly named Enoch Root, in a probable reference to the name of the [Unix superuser](!Wikipedia "Superuser#Unix and Unix-like") account. Root serves an unclear purpose but seems unaging and to aspire to enable some sort of technological or scientific development of mankind. I am also reminded of the character [Judge Holden](!Wikipedia "Judge Holden#Judge Holden in Blood Meridian") in Cormac McCarthy's 1985 _[Blood Meridian](!Wikipedia)_.], please, this is Leo Highet, as traffic locked to a dead stop.

--Dan, it's Leo. I'm stuck in traffic, 101's a parking lot. I'll meet you at the restaurant soon as I can, pulling as he hung up onto the shoulder, accelerating past the stopped cars, punching brakes and horn together and sliding his window down to shout --Asshole! at another driver also edging onto the shoulder, and to swerve up the offramp where again he jammed brakes to join two lanes merging under a stand of blooming acacias, as the radio warned, --Friends it's alarming but people do judge you by the words you use. Semantech Dynamic Language Cassettes give you the essential power words you need to dominate any, itch rising in his gorge to trigger a violent sneeze contorting his face and leaving it a mask of suspicion until he spied the high cascades of yellow blooms tossed in the caress of a warm breeze, --ah shit! and jammed the window button to slide the glass unhurriedly shut, other hand reaching for the glove box, eyes streaming as he reached for his inhaler and again punched A/C MAX, removing sunglasses to dab at his tearing left eye, glimpsing in the mirror angry red skin under a pale brow as horns blared behind him and the radio asked, --Have you ever wondered if [hair transplants](!Wikipedia) are for you? and eased the clutch to inch forward from the offramp onto a six lane divided thoroughfare where he chose his opportunities to advance through gaps and openings among cars streaming in a semblance of purpose complex to the edge of chaos past two miles of low featureless office parks and condominiums shrouded by olive and eucalyptus until SOON YET loomed and, cutting across two lanes, he glimpsed his left eye swollen, his nose reddened and enlarged. --Great, just great.

Near the restaurant door DISABLED PARKING ONLY. Highet parked, the car alarm yelping as he pressed keychain to arm it, and paused in the foyer to ask of an impassive Chinese, --Dan Root? and followed the pointing hand to a bellow of laughter rising over the clatter and din of plates flatware talk and the plume of smoke curled there above the massive figure in white Stetson and black shit with red and white embroidery across the yoke, and he edged down a narrow corridor past a potted ficus and a woman laughing into a pay phone and entered the men's room where a mirror set upon mauve and avocado [pg75] tile showed him a face divided, right half normal, left half angry with welts and distended into a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery, the eye a furtive and evil bead in swollen flesh, the lip lifted to expose teeth, as though presenting a threat while the rest of his face apologized for it. He cranked a chrome lever to reel yards of paper toweling into a basin under a faucet that every few seconds pinched off its flow like a prostatitic urethra until he banged the springloaded tap to restart it. The last of the toweling tailed into the sink and he lifted the soaked paper to his face and held it there covering the welts, regarding stolidly the unafflicted yet still unlovely right side until he recoiled --Damn! from moisture seeping at his shoulder, collar, and hair, and flung the toweling onto the floor, turning in vain for another towel dispenser, shaking his wet hands in the air in a desperate [mudra](!Wikipedia) of fury, running them through his thinning and awry black hair before reentering the dining room where the massive figure at table six craned his broad neck around and exhaled smoke in greeting.

--Why, you look like sumpin the cat's all done with.

--And a good morning to you too, Dan. You're in form.

--Oh, I am. Dim sum, a double corona, and technology transfer. It's all a man really needs to be happy. Leo, you know Orrin Gate. Orr's chairman of Gate Cellular. He was out to the ranch after your last shot. I think you met there.

--Yes, good to, pardon my, no towels in the men's, cut off by an obstreperous fit of coughing at the table behind him, --enjoying the cell phone you sent, very clear signal, never a problem even in the car.

--I'm glad. We are very good at what we do.

--Pull up a pew, boy, here on my right, said Root, handing him as he sat a napkin to dry his face.

--These allergies will kill me yet.

--He'll have two of these and two of those, Root said, taking from a passing cart four small plates.

--What's this?

--Duck feet, and these are jellied.

--Excuse me, came a sharp voice, as Highet turned his bad eye wincing into Root's exhalation of cigar smoke, --This is the non-smoking section. [pg76]

Root shifted his bulk and thrust his shoulders back in thunderstruck disbelief. --What did you say, sonny?

--Your smoke is ruing other people's enjoyment of their meals.

Root's pale blue eyes narrowed in the fat ruddy face framed by lank gray hair and beard. The tooled ivory clasp on his red string tie rose gently and gently fell on the placket of his black shirt, and a slight smile widened his mouth.

--I'm Dan Root. And you are? extending a hand which the other man took reflexively.

--It doesn't mat, annoyance turning to concern as he flinched in Root's grip.

--Ruin, is it. I guess you don't know what ruination is.

Root touched the coal of his cigar against the base of the thumb gripped in his hand.

--Jesus...! as for a fraction of a second the hand writhed in Root's grip beneath the coal, then was snatched back and cradled like a wounded pet.

--You best put some ice on that.

--You're crazy! The man backed to his table staring at Root, face lit as with the fire of revelation. Root turned back to the table and set the cigar in an ashtray.

--I sheerly love to take the righteous down a peg. It's almost worth a spoiled ash.

--Someday one of your victims will call a cop, Highet said.

--That man won't call a cop. Why, until now, he thought he was [Wyatt Earp](!Wikipedia).

at his table the man upended a water glass and wrapped ice in a napkin. His companions bent forward in earnest discussion while the man stubbornly shook his head.

--Try the parchment wrapped chicken, Orr. No no, unwrap it first. Now, Leo, what's all this crap I'm hearing about Superbright problems?

Highet looked distastefully from Root to Gate and back. --Dan, I know what an omniscient view you have from your ranch in the mountains, but some of us down in the trenches

--I just want to know if we get trouble. [pg77]

--This is a classified program, Dan, I'm not going to start talking technical details to the unsanctified.

--Unsanctified? asked Gate.

--Security, Orr, he's worried about security.

--That's right, Dan. We're not all freelancers like you.

--Simmer down son.

Gate cleared his throat. --Perhaps I can start. I'll express our interest in general terms, so that any inadvertent classifications breaches won't jeopardize you gentlemen. As I understand it, the Superbright component of the Radiance project is not coming online as quickly as anticipated. Consequently, a secondline component of Radiance may be frontburnered. This second program has aspects of interest to us outside its purposive antimissile envelope. Fair enough?

--Go on.

--Gate Cellular is eager to enter the growing digital information market^[This may be related to [Teledesic](!Wikipedia), in which Bill Gates was an investor.]. To play in this market requires vast amounts of cable. That or satellites. The larger players have a formidable lead in the cable market, but there are parts of the globe where, for political or geographic reasons, cable can't be laid. Some companies propose to serve these areas with a small number of geosynchronous satellites in high orbit. We think there's a better way: a few hundred small, cheap, moveable satellites in low orbit. Research and development costs are high, so we're looking for strategic partners.

Root pulled from a shirt pocket some papers and unfolded them. --Long as we're bein so circumspect... This is from [Aviation Leak](!Wikipedia "Aviation Week"). "The Slingshot orbiting interceptors kill incoming enemy missiles by impact. Simple and small enough to be deployed by the thousands, they are little more than a camcorder, a guidance computer, and [hydrazine](!Wikipedia) thrusters." Put a high speed switching network onboard, what've you got.

--Slingshot? asked Gate.

--That's what we're calling them now, said Highet. --A David and Goliath thing. Little pebble of a missile knocking out an ICBM by kinetic force.

--Or any other target, said Root.

--Dan..., Highet warned. [pg78]

--As I understand it, Doctor Highet, the Lab wishes to move into more commercial applications.

--Wish has nothing to do with it, it's a Department of Energy mandate.

--In any case, they're encouraging [Cooperative Research And Development Agreements](!Wikipedia) with industry, correct?

--Yes, said Highet. --But Slingshot isn't a candidate for a CRADA. It has classified components.

--Orr's application is outside the defense envelope, said Root, folding the papers. --I say it's dual use.

--Looked at the right way almost anything's dual use. But DOE won't open a CRADA on this, I guarantee you.

--CRADA, who wants a CRADA, I'd sooner have cancer. You're getting prissy in your old age, Leo. You didn't talk this way back in the days of Transfinite Polygonics.

--Didn't have a senator on Appropriations out to hang me then.

--Shit, Leo, you remember when you and Réti and me came up with these orbiters, called em Baldurs then.

--Dan...

--Remember? That weekend at the ranch? Hell, I got patents that overlap all this stuff. You saying I don't have a right?

--Look, last thing we need right now's even the appearance of improp

--What's your damn trouble, Leo? Those Superbright tests?

--Dan, will you shut up before you

--Gentlemen, permit me. The press has suggested, with whatever truth, that delays with Superbright may jeopardize the entire Radiance project, including the Slingshot interceptors. Now it seems to me, if the defense value of Slingshot is seriously questioned, a parallel commercial mission could save it. It would seem wise to have that commercial mission in place before such questions arise.

--Listen to Orr, Leo. He knows his stuff. Orr went to school with Undersecretary Rip Whipple^[Corruption aside, possibly based on [Fred Iklé](!Wikipedia).].

Highet dipped a corner of his napkin into his water glass and held it to his swollen face. --Can we get some more tea?

--Doctor Highet, the men's room is, where? Past that ficus? Thank you. Pardon me. [pg79]

Root watched Gate's departure, then turned on Highet. --What the hell's wrong with you? Why the hissy fit?

--Whipple's about to resign, Dan.

--What? How come?

--His Radiance Liaison Office at the Pentagon handed out half a billion in contracts last year, all approved and overseen by the same four people. Turned out all four used to work for him.

--Shitfire. What's he gone do?

--Back to private industry where he can make five times what he made at Defense.

--And they wonder why they can't keep good men. But so what, that's not your problem. What is?

--Got all those patents, Dan, you don't need me.

--We need [Sand Hill Road](!Wikipedia), that's Orr, and we need the Beltway, that's you.

--I'm not exactly Beltway Bob these days.

--Did those test results get leaked? That shot with the sensor problems?

--Jesus Dan let's, a little louder, let's call CNN why don't we. You haven't seen it in the papers, have you?

--That's it, isn't it, that's why you're sweating.

--Those results are classified.

--Is there a trail back to Null? You have to tell me that.

--There's no trail. We're writing a report to make our own trail.

--Who's doing the report?

--Quine.

--Who?

--He wrote the x-ray focusing code. And he supervised the shot, along with Dietz. That kid we fired, Thorpe, the scapegoat, he was working under Quine.

--What's Quine like?

--He's a fuckup.

--So why are you letting him write this report?

--He and Dietz supervised the test. You know Dietz. So I tapped Quine. I bumped him up to deputy associate director.

--You crazy? Deputy associate of what? [pg80]

--Of enough rope.

--Slater's old post.

--I think people will get the message.

--I don't trust Szabo, he'd use this to get a leg up on me.

--Thought you had that degree thing on him.^[See ["Top U.S. laser expert admits lack of a PhD and resigns"](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/31/us/top-us-laser-expert-admits-lack-of-a-phd-and-resigns.html).]

--Why waste it? Anyway Quine pulled a fast one on that test, he set up that kid, Thorpe. Very down and dirty. I want to see how he writes it up. His head may yet end up on a stick.

--Better his than mine or yours.

--What do you want with Slingshot, Dan? You know how to do comm sats.

--We want those thrusters of yours, boy. Mine couldn't keep a bird in low orbit for a year^[[Orbital station-keeping](!Wikipedia) is much more difficult in low orbits because drag from the residual atmosphere requires repeated accelerations to avoid being dragged down into the atmosphere and destroyed.]. You're claiming ten years? Is that for real? With those dinky little fuel tanks?

--Classified.

--Fuck you too. What's our lead time?

--First tests in August. Next round of CRADAs in November.

--These birds really gonna work?

--Jesus Chr, you sound like Senator Samuel Fitzfuck Chase, are they going to work, they're *tests*, Dan, that's why we do them, because we don't fucking know. If we knew it'd save us all a lot of time wouldn't it now.

--Boy, you're on edge. You need a vacation. Whyn't you come up the ranch? Take us a couple horses up to Steelhead Lake, catch some trout. Not much snow this year, gonna be an early summer. What do you say?

--Coming up Sunday for those Hertz recruits, aren't I.

--I mean a real vacation.

--I'm fine.

--Why's Chase worryin you? Our bud Howie Bangerter chairs that committee.

--Howie and his Mormon butt boys.

--Don't say that to Orr, he's LDS.

--You're kidding.

--I mean it. He's a [deacon](!Wikipedia "Deacon (Latter Day Saints)") or something. [pg81]

Highet turned to see the blacksuited figure returning past the ficus in the hall.

--Gate know what he's doing?

--Five years from now he should own this market. We're talkin billions, boy.

--If the crick don't rise.

--There you go. That's my Leo. Don't you worry now.

--Gentlemen.

--You know, you're not the only interested party, Dan. I heard from Stone last week...

--Stone! You're not serious. Any man who'll play for nickels can't be trusted.

--Mister Gate, question for you, why do you want a low Earth orbit for comm sats?

--Please, call me Orr. A big reason to go LEO is signal delay. Geo-synchronous sats have a perigree of twenty thousand miles. By the time you've bounced your signal off them there's a perceptible delay. That's not acceptable for time critical uses.

--Isn't [Motorola](!Wikipedia "Iridium satellite constellation") on this turf?

--Yes, they are. But they plan to orbit fewer satellites quite a bit higher.

--This seems, I'm just freewheeling here, a system this size seems like a risky commitment for an unproved market and a small company.

--That's why we're looking for allies. But the market's there. If not for cellular, for something else. As I was saying to the vice president, and Root shot Highet a glance while Highet looked bored, --we think of the satellites as delivery systems. We're still looking for content providers.

--There's a question in my mind what we get out of this.

--We bring to the table high speed high capacity packet switching and routing technologies. Linking the Slingshots in a networked system could make them viable for a wide range of applications. Weather monitoring, pollution tracking, global positioning...

--Okay, I think I can package that.

--Now let me ask you this. I understand that a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement grants an exemption from the [pg82] [Freedom of Information Act](!Wikipedia).

--Our working model gives a five year FOIA exemption.

--Good.

--But getting DOE to sign off won't be easy. Slingshot is a defense program, they're sticky about that.

--Shit, Leo...

--Surely, pardon me Dan, surely the Department of Energy can be made to see the benefit. Their CRADA program is, from what I hear, unsuccessful so far. This venture could be a showpiece for them, wouldn't you say? And I understand that Slingshot itself has a shall we say clouded future.

--Can't speak for DOE, they have trouble seeing the sun on a clear day, but I'll do what I can. We'll draft a letter of agreement, see where we go from there.

--Excellent. I'll fax you our latest business plan.

Root raised his hand in a scribbling gesture and across the room the manager left the man clutching his wrapped hand and darted over to slide the check under Root's hand freeing from a gold clip three hundred-dollar bills. Root winked at the manager. --Somethin for the help.

The three men rose and walked leisurely to the door. Gate said to Root, --I'm sorry [Mister Kim](!Wikipedia "Kim Jong-il") couldn't make it.

--Mister Kim? said Highet.

--Oh, another potential investor, said Root. --He's kind of a recluse.

--Mister Kim. That Sand Hill Road, Dan? Or Seoul?

--Pyongyang. He he, see his face, Orr? See it. Had him going.

In the vestibule they threaded through a crowd coming and going, past the phone booth where a wrapped hand rose gesticulating above the partition and snatches of talk emerged from the background din like complexities at the surface of chaotic systems, --got to get back I'm about to slit a cat stem to sternum, and --soon's I quit I get two offers not even looking, and --Christ it's hot for March, and two small boys darting either side of them, one shouting, --I win! I'm king of the world! as the three men emerged into sunlight and Root pushed up the brim of his Stetson and dropped the stub of his cigar to the [pg83] pavement where he ground it to smoldering pulp beneath his bootsole.

--Got you a love note there, Leo.

Highet followed Root's deliberative gaze from the curve of a horsetail cloud slipping across sky's pale dome between a stately pair of eucalyptus, leaves shimmering like unheeded semaphores, flanking a squat white savings and loan 11:30 82F 28C and finally down to SFORZA and the black vinyl bib stretched across the snout of the red hood into which was tucked a parking ticket.

--Well gents, as the great [Karl Friedrich Gauss](!Wikipedia) said, Go you forward and faith will come to you.^[This is typically attributed to French atheist mathematician [Jean le Rond d'Alembert](!Wikipedia) as _Allez en avant, et la foi vous viendra_ ("Keep going, and faith will come"); Scholz may be getting the misattribution from McCarthy's _[The Stonemason](!Wikipedia)_.]

--Thank you for your time, Doctor Highet.

--Mister Gate, we'll be in touch. Dan, always a pleasure.

The car yelped as Highet disarmed it, Gate flinching from the sound as Root cast an arm around him, saying, --Leo'll eat anything that don't eat him.

On the bridge, hurtling down the far span, the ticket fluttered like a trapped bird till it tore free as the car boomed past [a mobile home](!Wikipedia "Winnebago Industries") named for [that tribe](!Wikipedia "Ho-Chunk") whose [tale of](http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CHEROKEE/2008-06/1214789071 "Little Brother Snares The Sun") [Little Brother](http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2001/Jun/10/tell-me-a-story-little-brother-and-the-sun-a/?print=1 "TELL ME A STORY: Little Brother and the Sun (a Winnebago Indian tale)"), so similar to that of [Phaeton](!Wikipedia) and Helios, did not punish but rewarded its hero with wisdom and respect for his snaring of the sun, and raced mere feet above the bay, accelerating past NO TOLL THIS DIRECTION and the leaching pools and the industrial parks, one hand scanning past --it's your constitutional right! to an orotund voice that had --nothing to be ashamed for! as the freeway broadened to eight lanes sprawled like a flattened snake up green hillsides turning gold so early in the year after --seventh year of drought for Cali, while elsewhere, --flood waters so severe, seemed to demonstrate the chaotic extrema of a global climate under assault by the ffluvia of --traffic and weather togeth, until, satisfied for the moment that no news, of himself at least, was good news, Highet silenced the radio and slipped a silver disk into the slot of the CD player to let the doomed guitar of [Robert Johnson](!Wikipedia) carry him back to Codornices EXIT NLY and past the city's central mall, cutting across a chorus of horns and around Estancia Estates, where CREDNE CONSTRUCTION earthmovers pushed back still further the [chaparral](!Wikipedia) behind the open frames of identical [pg84] unfinished houses, and banners flapped in the hot wind STARTING AT $150,000.

Coming then to the main gate of the Lab, fortress city of ten thousand souls behind razorwire, slowing past the demonstrators in their [motley](!Wikipedia), with their handmade signs FRAUD DECEPTION STOP NOW, the darkhaired woman absent today, the woman he'd first singled out for heckling because of her beauty, Highet swerved to flatten a rolling paper cup under his wheel, stopping at the kiosk to show ID, --Morning, Jake, and continuing through the doubly fenced desert of broken rock and motion sensors, into Building 101's parking lot, RESERVED DIRECTOR, noting with distaste Philip Quine's battered white Subaru parked at the far end near a yellow backhoe <<ULTRA-DIG>> beyond which rose the terraced adumbration of a building, its southern facade cloaked in mauve and avocado tile while the northern half, an unfinished cliff of raw concrete spattered with pale mud, fell away to a terrain of rutted earth and pools of bright green flux, all enclosed by chainlink and plywood sheets stenciled ADOBE LUMBER and CREDNE, the halfmade bulwark oddly deserted by its builders although the workday was at its height.

--Morning, Dolores, as he entered the outer office, frowning at the radio declaiming in carefully modulated outrage, --typical liburrul modis operendy. He calls my logic cheap and my facts hazy and my reasoning fellatious, until Dolores reached the knob to silence it, and Highet plucked the Ohlone Valley Herald from a box of mail in which a smaller carton held two and a half doughnuts, --Think we can keep the jelly off the correspondence? rounding the desk to come --Ow! hard against heavy boxes sealed with a gray cover sheet Final Environmental Impact Statements and Report For Continued Operation of Laboratories.

--Geez, you look just awful. Take a doughnut if you want.

--Thanks so much Dolores. Might as well, there's most of one on the newspaper already. What's all this junk?

--That's the EIS back from the printers, you wanted three copies.

--Three? Looks like a flat of phone books, prodding one box with a foot.

--It's seven volumes, six thousand pages. You have calls

--How many of these things did we print? [pg85]

--Two thousand sets. You have

--I love it, we're clearcutting the Pacific Northwest to print environmental impact statements. Is Conor here?

--He was. Your new computer arrived. You have

--At least something went right while I was gone.

--You have calls from EPA, DOE, DoD, the university regents' office, Philip Quine, Bernd Dietz, Doctor Réti, Senator Chase, the vice president

--Of what?

--Of the United States.

--God, I love to hear those words. You put all this on the mojo?

--No the network is down, that's why I'm telling you. Also William Venham, your sister Thea, and Cedars-Sin

--Why's the network down? Conor! Get him in here.

--and you have a one o'clock

--Don't remind me, as he pushed open the inner office door and the voice rose up again behind him, --my friends, it's demonstrative that, and the door swinging wide banged a tower of cartons, --Fuck! toppling them in a spill of bubblewrap, styrofoam, spiralbound manuals, warranty cards, and cables bagged in plastic across the floor to where a black box [aXon](!Wikipedia "NeXT") with matching monitor, keyboard, and printer sat on his desk. Highet put down the newspaper and the doughnut and his blunt fingers touched its matte surface, which took briefly their sweaty imprint then swallowed it like mist, as Conor entered yawning, slim to frailty in a black t-shirt [SEROTONIN](!Wikipedia "Serotonin") C~10~H~12~N~2~O, fine black hair in a ponytail, trim mustache and beard, a reliably complaisant witness to Highet's pleasure or displeasure.

--Sorry about the mess, boss, I'll clean it up. I didn't know if you wanted to keep the boxes. What's wrong with your face?

--My face? Not a thing. Feel good about yourself, Conor, the world will love you. Is this thing sexy or what?

--It rocks. Conor stooped to gather cables, deftly mating socket to plug, snugging keyboard and mouse. The machine gave out a suave chord and the screen lit with chiseled icons bright along its border.

--The operating system was written for aXon by grad students at [Cambridge](!Wikipedia "Carnegie Mellon University"). They got chump change, and the aXon execs are all driving [pg86] Ferraris. What is it about you students, you're supposed to be so smart.

--We are Zen mind.

--Is that why you took the network down so I have to collect my messages by [sneakernet](!Wikipedia)?

--[Mu](!Wikipedia "Mu (negative)"), o master. We had a little incident. Somebody put some pornographic [GIF](!Wikipedia) files up on an open server. We had to take it offline. Unfortunately it was also a mail server.

Highet grimaced. --Christ, don't people have anything better to do with themselves? How long were the files there?

--The creation dates vary. Days, months, don't know.

--This was on an open server? Save the files, I want to know what's going on there. Now what about my mail?

--Behold the little mailbox. Every time you boot, he knows to check for spooled mail on the server, and there, leaning in to smartly tap the black teardrop mouse, --you are.

--Are those my messages from Dolores? Okay, you can keep your job. But get rid of these empty boxes.

--Do you want to store them?

--You kidding? Shitcan them.

--And the manuals?

--We don't need no stinkin manuals, pivoting with one hand to type in his password • • • • • •  and burst open the iconic mailbox as Conor hovered nosily.

--Chaos on the edge of complexity?

--Just the usual noise. Now clear out of here and let me start taking out the trash. Come by at four and we'll talk about your [Rayleigh-Taylor](!Wikipedia "Rayleigh–Taylor instability") project.

--Cool.

As the door closed Highet slumped back in his chair. His breath came harshly and with suspensions. In his bowels dim sum moved restlessly. Opening his eyes he stared blankly at a slick card aXon Warranty Tell Us About Yourself, picked it up, and flipped it spinning to ricochet from the lip of the trash can to the carpet.

He took the Ohlone Valley Herald and cellular phone into his private bathroom, resting the newspaper on the sinktop while he unfolded [pg87] the phone, loosened his belt, lowered his pants, settled sighing onto the seat, and then punched SEND. --Dolores? Get me an hour in the gym at four. Yes I know, don't remind me, punching END, raising the newspaper to [Grand Jury Indicts 4 LA Cops](!Wikipedia "Rodney King"), Estancia Expansion Given Green Light, turning to the editorial page where, --Son of a! welts on his face reddened as he took the phone, selected a number from its display, punched SEND and waited. --Doctor Réti please. It's Leo Highet, and scanned the text, post-Cold War era, needless expense, environmental hazards, [peace dividend](!Wikipedia). --Aron, have you seen today's Herald? What? Oh, that went fine, I think Gate's on board. But the Herald, listen to this, lead editorial, Stop Nuclear Testing Now. What is this crap? We employ ten thousand people, we *made* this fucking cow town, where does he get off? No, don't placate me! I don't care about the editorial, paper's a joke and everybody but Greer knows it, I just want to know why he's getting feisty. And it's not just him, I've got calls in from Chase, DoD, DOE, the vice president I mean what's going on? Who's talking to who? Yes I'll be here the rest of, wait, got a meeting at one but I'll have Dolores put you through. Find out what you can, pressing END, and the phone instantly trilled in his hand and he shifted his nates, sighing. --Highet. What is it, Dolores. Tell her, no, never mind, I'll take it. Hello Thea, how's mother. Uh huh. Yes I did. Well, they've done what they can. If it's chronic, there's nothing... no, I, look, Thea, she's seventy-eight years old, she's had a full life. No. No I can't poss. Well, you do what you like but I. Thea, are you listening? I just said I can't. I run a billion dollar laboratory here, I can't just take a week off and come to Lancaster, it's out of the. Look, don't start. Call Mark and hassle him why don't you. Uh huh. Thea, lis, Thea, listen to me. I'm hanging up. I don't have time for this. I'll call you when you've got mother home. Goodbye, Thea, pressing END, --Jesus suffering Christ, and dialing again to wait through, --Thank you for calling the Ohlone Valley Herald, if you know the extension of, and punched 4 3 1, refolding the newspaper and spooling off a length of toilet paper while waiting through --J Frank Greer is not in his office right now. If you would like to leave a message, please wait for the tone.

--J Frank, it's Leo Highet. You know, out at the lab, where your [pg88] son works, I'm in a small room with funny furniture. Your editorial is in front of me. Highet rustled toilet paper at the mouthpiece. --Now it's behind me. He snapped shut the phone.

He rose then, wiped and flushed, gazing like a [haruspex](!Wikipedia) at the spiral arms of the swirl as the auguries were swept away. Red pepper, sausage, pasta. Fragments rose in the ebb unflushed and he flushed again. In the misasma was a faint scent of asparagus. he washed his hands. At the doorway, hitching his belt, he thumbed on a fan and shut the door behind him as both desk phone and cellular phone trilled together.

--Already? Thank you Dolores. He glanced at his watch, and took a folder from the desk drawer, opening it to confirm its contents and stepped over the threshold where the toe of his loafer came down on aXon Warranty Tell Us skidding him past Dolores startled from YOUR IMAGE YOUR SUCCESS How To Polish Your Management Style to turn down --friends, I am the epitome of, as he caught his balance to stride out and down the hall, pausing outside the conference room just long enough to hear, --therfucker can't imagine anyone doing anything for decent reasons, he thinks everybody has an agend, silenced by his entrance into air stifling as a bunker under high sealed windows like embrasures.

--Morning Leo.

Dietz, Szabo, Karp, Quine, sitting there, sweltering, jackets over their chairs, shirts spotted with sweat. Looking at his swollen face. No one saying what they thought. Highet laid down his papers, put on halfglasses, and remained standing.

--Like an inferno in here, what's the problem?

--I called physical plant. They say the air conditioner's screwed up.

--That's really great, we need physical plant to tell us that?

--They say they're working on it.

--What about the other conference room?

--They're painting it.

--I thought we painted it last year. Oh, I remember, one of those idiotic use it or lose it budget items. Speaking of which, where's Kihara? I asked him to be here.

--He, ah, said he had a brush fire to put out. [pg89]

--He say what it was?

--Something about an EIS.

--Frank, did you take that meeting with Jeremy Rector this morning?

--Yes, sir. Him and two other federal-looking gentlemen from the General Accounting Office.

--And?

--They'll be back.

--Okay, let's start without Kihara. Yes, what is it, Bernd?

Dietz rose and held out a white envelope, its end trembling. --I must tell you. I cannot continue here. For a long time I have known this. I hear rumblings, it is like a great building with a bad foundation, a few cracks appear, the collapse begins, no, I cannot stay on, this is my resignation.

--Bernd, sit down...

--Last night someone from CNN calls my home, to ask about charges of fraud.

--Did this someone identify himself?

--Armand Steradian.

--Wasn't he that PBS guy used to hang around here, Leo?

--Ex-PBS. After that backstabbing special of his I made some calls. He'll never work for them again. What did you tell him, Bernd?

--Nothing! But I can read the writing.

--Bernd, you're overreacting. This is nothing more than our friend Chase leaking rumors. If he had anything real, he wouldn't be phoning in anonymous tips to Chicken Noodle News. Show some nerve. He's just waiting for someone to bolt.

--But I tell you I cannot

--Bernd. Do me a favor. Put that envelope back in your pocket. Keep it there over the weekend. If you still feel this way on Monday, we'll talk.

Highet looked around at the rest of them. Not saying what they thought. Sweat ran down his ribs.

--I'm glad Bernd brought this up. It's stressful but it's nothing new. The Radiance program has some unresolved issues, we know this. We also know that we can resolve them. But in the meantime our [pg90] critics are getting vocal. Is there anyone here who can't take the heat?

Dietz glanced at Quine. The others held their poker faces.

--Okay. Let's move on to business. You all know how DOE is talking up dual use technologies. We hear this so often, the old plowshare polka.

--Dual use technologies, said Szabo. --I've got one of those in my pants.

--Thanks Frank, I'm sure we all

--Looked so nice out this morning I'd thought I'd

--appreciate your wit. Here's my point. This is an opportunity. We can start moving Radiance technologies under the dual use envelope.

--What about the GAO investigation? asked Karp.

--I'm not worried. The report isn't due for a few months. You've all given your interviews, right?

Quine was readying to speak. That habitual wounded look. Always about to flinch. As Quine's mouth opened, Highet spoke.

--Philip, you were reviewing the recent Superbright tests. Where are you on that?

--I'm finished, pulling several spiralbound xeroxes from a black nylon carryall.

Highet stared in disbelief. --I thought your timeframe was longer.

--I'm done.

--Well, hold those. It's not appropriate to discuss them now. Not till we've all seen them.

The wounded reproach in Quine's eyes did not flinch but hardened. --I thought I'd distribute them now.

--I said hold them.

Something like rage there now. But no followup. Highet held his gaze for a second longer as Quine fingered the bindings.

--So, future directions. We've got CRADAs in x-ray lithography. Fusion research can cover a lot of programs. Frank, talk with P Section and see what all we can get under their umbrella. We're looking at reduced underground testing, very possibly a full ban. Bitter as that is, it's an opportunity for computer science, simulation codes, and for hydrodynamic and hydronuclear testing. What else, people? What else can we package? [pg91]
