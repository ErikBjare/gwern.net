Then I turned my attention to the Book.
Since the sole purpose of the Book was to punish its readers, the less said of it the
better. To study it, to copy it out, and to memorize it was an extraordinary form of
penance.
The concent, like any other human settlement, abounded in nasty or tedious chores
such as weeding gardens, maintaining sewers, peeling potatoes, and slaughtering
animals. In a perfect society we’d have taken turns. As it was, there were rules and
codes of conduct that people broke from time to time, and the Warden Regulant saw
to it that those people performed the most disagreeable jobs. It was not a bad
system. When you were fixing a clogged latrine because you’d had too much to
drink in the Refectory, you might not have such an enjoyable day, but the fact of
the matter was that latrines were necessary; sometimes they clogged up; and some
fraa or suur had to clean them out, as we couldn’t very well call in an outside
plumber. So there was at least some satisfaction in doing such penance, because
there was a point in the work.
There was no point at all to the Book, which is what made it an especially dreaded
form of penance. It contained twelve chapters. Like the scale used to measure
earthquakes, these got exponentially worse as they went on, so Chapter Six was ten
times as bad as Chapter Five, and so on. Chapter One was just a taste, meted out
to delinquent children, and usually completed in an hour or two. Two meant at
least one overnight stay, though any self-respecting troublemaker could bang it out
in a day. Five typically meant a stay of several weeks. Any sentence of Chapter Six
or higher could be appealed to the Primate and then to the Inquisition. Chapter
Twelve amounted to a sentence of life at hard labor in solitary confinement; only
three avout had finished it in 3690 years, and all of them were profoundly insane.
Beyond about Six, the punishment could span years. Many chose to leave the
concent rather than endure it. Those who stuck it out were changed when they
emerged: subdued, and notably diminished. Which might sound crazy, because
there was nothing to it other than copying out the required chapters, memorizing
them, and then answering questions about them before a panel of hierarchs. But
the contents of the Book had been crafted and refined over many centuries to be
nonsensical, maddening, and pointless: flagrantly at first, more subtly as the
chapters progressed. It was a maze without an exit, an equation that after weeks of
toil reduced to 2 = 3. Chapter One was a page of nursery-rhymes salted with
nonsense-words that almost rhymed—but not quite. Chapter Four was five pages of
the digits of pi. Beyond that, however, there was no further randomness in the
Book, since it was easy to memorize truly random things once you taught yourself a
few tricks—and everyone who’d made it through Chapter Four knew the tricks.
Much harder to memorize and to answer questions about were writings that almost
but did not quite make sense; that had internal logic, but only to a point. Such
things cropped up naturally in the mathic world from time to time—after all, not
everyone had what it took to be a Saunt. After their authors had been humiliated
and Thrown Back, these writings would be gone over by the Inquisition, and, if they
were found to be the right kind of awful, made even more so, and folded into later
and more wicked editions of the Book. To complete your sentence and be granted
permission to walk out of your cell, you had to master them just as thoroughly as,
say, a student of quantum mechanics must know group theory. The punishment
lay in knowing that you were putting all of that effort into letting a kind of
intellectual poison infiltrate your brain to its very roots. It was more humiliating
than you might imagine, and after I’d been toiling on Chapter Five for a couple of
weeks I had no difficulty in seeing how one who completed a sentence of, say,
Chapter Nine would emerge permanently damaged.
