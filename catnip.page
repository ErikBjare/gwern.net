Speculative:

- there are anecdotal reports that some cats are attracted to olive products: olive wood, olive oil, and olive fruits themselves

# Local cats

The catnip literature has a good sample of what the catnip frequency response is, but it's clear that a lot of cats are immune and their owners need to use one of the many substitutes.
The literature does not seem to have much, if any, coverage of all the main alternatives, so owners don't know what to try after catnip.
There's also no information on any correlations between responses: does catnip immunity cause susceptibility to a different stimulant? Are some cats more response to stimulants in general? If we know a cat is immune to, say, catnip and valerian, can we better predict what a owner should try next?

Since cats are easy to come by and the stimulants are cheap, I thought it might be interesting to assemble a collection of stimulants and systematically try them out on each cat I should happen to meet.
Specifically, I'll look at the most common and easy to come by stimulants, since it's not useful to discover that some extinct African flower is super-potent:

- Catnip (obviously)
- Tatarian honeysuckle (one of the most frequently mentioned alternatives)
- Valerian (not as commonly mentioned, but very cheap due to its popularity as a herbal supplement for sleep & anxiety)
- Silvervine (rarer & more expensive but still accessible, and reputedly quite effective)
- Olive oil/wood (cats' reacting to olive-related things is an obscure & anecdotal claim; but both are easy to get and included for the sake of comprehensiveness)

    - [Arata Silvervine 0.5gx12pk, Cat's Favorite, Best Value](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008PNNMHW/): \$10.95 + \$6.82 (S&H from Japan for the silvervine) = \$17.77 (ordered 8 November 2015, arrived 4 December 2015)
    - olives:

        - [Titone Bio Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil Novello 2015](http://www.amazon.com/Titone-Organic-Extra-Virgin-Novello/dp/B018SZ84OM/): \$36.95+\$10 S&H = \$37.95

            Normally I would not buy such extremely expensive artisanal olive oil as regular virgin olive oil is adequate for my cooking, but the olive oil trade is [notoriously rife with counterfeits](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/13/slippery-business "Slippery Business: The trade in adulterated olive oil") and tests with standard supermarket wares might be worse than useless if I am actually testing out soy/hazelnut/sunflower-seed/canola oil and they turn out to not have any of the critical cat-attractant chemicals. The 2015 oil is recent and this brand should be authentic. (If nothing else, it tastes quite good.)
        - [Large Olive Wood Pen Blanks from Bethlehem - 15.5 x 3.8 x 3.8 cm (6.1 x 1.496 x 1.496 Inch)](http://www.amazon.com/Large-Olive-Wood-Blanks-Bethlehem/dp/B00MYHBBW8): \$9.59

            Cheapest unworked/unprocessed chunk of olive wood I could find on Amazon.
    - subtotal: \$94.12
- Toys (need multiple to avoid cross-contamination):

    - [Go Cat Teaser Cat Catcher Wand Cat Toy](http://www.amazon.com/Go-Cat-Catcher-Teaser-Mouse/dp/B000LPOUNW/): \$7.03
    - [ColorPet Bird Replacement Feathers and Soft Furry For Interactive Cat and Kitten Toy Wands Super Refill, Assorted Colors Cat Toys; 9 pieces](http://www.amazon.com/ColorPet-Replacement-Feathers-Interactive-Assorted/dp/B0144LUQYK/): \$9.62
    - subtotal: \$16.65
- total: \$63.23

For each stimulant, one clean never-used feather was put into a clean jar along with a good helping of the relevant stimulant, and shaken and left to sit.
The olive wood would not fit into a jar, so I sawed it in half, saved the sawdust, and put the two wood blocks, sawdust, and feather into a little ziplock bag.
The wand lets the feathers be added or removed easily so I can test each feather one at a time by switching feathers, playing with the cat for 5 minutes, and waiting for any response or indication of interest beyond regular chase.
This works well, aside from the silvervine powder where inevitably some of the powder falls off or blows out of the container, so it's best to do the silvervine last.

Description of effects in responders:

- Catnip: too well known to need much description. Cats become 'hyper', uninhibited, playful, interested in the catnip toy
- Valerian: on Oolong, produces an interesting mix of passiveness and possessiveness - after onset, he mostly lays on the floor passively, occasionally pulling himself across it towards the toy, but generally making little effort to hunt; if the toy comes within reach, though, then he seizes it energetically and abruptly begins clasping it to his face, chewing it, curling up around it and kicking at the toy with his hind legs. Eventually he can be coaxed into playing chase normally, with his usual level of competence and interest.
- Honeysuckle: on Percy, had a general stimulant effect; despite being fat, lazy, and usually entirely uninterested in chase, he will make an effort to play after sniffing a honeysuckle-impregnated toy. This stimulating effect does not produce the un-inhibition of catnip, and seems fairly mild.
- Silvervine:

    1. on Oolong, a general stimulating effect with considerable interest in playing chase or watching the toy, but curiously, he makes many fewer attempts at attacking or chasing and when he does, he is distinctly slower (and thus, less effective) than usual. His coordination is fine - he's not clumsy or falling over - but he's just not as effective (in a way hard to pin down specifically).
    2. On Percy, likewise a general stimulating effect but far more effective than the honeysuckle in inducing chase play, with him even trying out jumps when coaxed appropriately; he may be less effective, like Oolong, but he plays chase so little that it's impossible for me to make any comparisons with his 'normal' chase behavior.
- Olive oil/wood: brief interest in smell, then ignored entirely.

# Survey

Collecting data by hand is very slow unless I make a major effort like getting permission from a local pound to spend a day or two testing all their cats.
But surveying cat owners could be a shortcut to getting a lot of data. (Only a few percent of respondents will have gone beyond catnip, but that's still a bigger sample than I have now.)

# Appendix
## Does initial data support one-and-only one response per cat?

When I tested the first two cats with the 3 stimulants I had, they both responded to exactly 1 of the 3 stimulants: Oolong ignored catnip & honeysuckle while responding to Valerian, and Percy ignored catnip & Valerian to respond to honeysuckle.
Honeysuckle and catnip supposedly have the same active ingredient while Valerian differs, so this is an odd pattern. Could there be something at play like a single mechanism which responds to only one chemical and so every cat responds to one-and-only-one-kind (OO) of stimulant? The existing literature doesn't seem to describe many (any?) tests of multiple stimulants on the same cat...
Is this much evidence?

Assume binary responses, that the default or null hypothesis theory here is that each stimulant has a 50% chance of working (I only know the population frequency for catnip, which *is* somewhat close to 50%), and they are independent; then the exact probability of drawing 1 of 3 is a binomial with 1 success of 3 trials with 50% chance of success or ~0.375 (through some combinatorics and can be checked by simulation), and then the probability of two such events is their conjunction of 0.375^2^=0.141.
This 0.141 can be interpreted as a _p_-value (the frequency with which the null hypothesis generates this particular set of stimulant responses if we sampled two cats).
If we didn't believe the probability of 0.375 pulled out of combinatorics, we could do a simulation-based hypothesis test by twice generating a possible value from a binomial distribution and seeing in how many simulations both datapoints (cats) yielded exactly 1 of 3, which matches our 0.141 _p_-value:

~~~{.R}
simulates <- 100000
matches <- sum(rbinom(simulates, 3, p=0.5)==1 & rbinom(simulates, 3, p=0.5)==1)
matches / simulates
# [1] 0.14012
~~~

OK, so we know under a plausible alternative model, our data from 2 cats occurs fairly often, but what does that mean?
A Bayesian model-comparison would be more meaningful.

In this case, we compare the binomial model with a model in which each cat responds to OO stimulant. We can use ABC to continue the theme.
One might object, don't we already know the result of an ABC? If we write a generative model for the OO theory, it will yield the data every time, and we already know the binomial theory yields the data only 14% of the time, so we get a ratio of $\frac{1}{0.14}=7$, which is an interesting level of evidence (keeping in mind that we must have a low prior on the idea of only one stimulant, since it didn't come to mind before we saw the data).

I would say that's not quite right, because here we have the twist that we still don't have the *silvervine* data - if it's true cats respond to only one stimulant, then silvervine could have been either cat's special stimulant and so they would appear to have no responses in our current data. The OO theory is that it would be out of the major stimulants, which are catnip, honeysuckle, Valerian *and* silvervine. So we need to account for the penalty that it predicts data other than we saw (like data in which neither cat responds to any of the 3 stimulants), which makes a BF of 7 to be an overestimate.

Here for ABC we could simulate this, but again the exact answer is easy: If there's 4 stimulants and we sample 3, and there is exactly 1 hit, the chance of observing it is $\frac{3}{4}$ (since the chance of *not* observing it, of it lurking in the last stimulant, #4, is $\frac{1}{4}$ and $1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$); and the probability of observing this twice is $\frac{3}{4}^2$ or 0.5625.
So the probability of the data under the null hypothesis is 0.141 and the probability under this alternative OO model is 0.5625, giving a ratio of 4 in favor of it (substantially less than the 7 before).

Since I find the OO theory to be ad hoc, based on looking at the data rather than modeling, and also weird - why would Percy react to honeysuckle and *not* catnip given that the active ingredient supposedly is nepetalactone in both? - I would give it a negligible prior probability like 1%, in which case a BF of 4 would increase only to around 4%.

---

In any case, after doing those calculations, I was able to try some more potential stimulants: silvervine, olive wood, and olive oil.
Under the OO theory, since we had already seen a response from both cats (for valerian & honeysuckle), we should see no further responses; but unsurprisingly, I did, as both of them responded to silvervine (though neither olive).
So we can probably reject the theory.
