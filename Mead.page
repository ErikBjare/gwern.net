I rarely drink alcoholic beverages. Alcohol makes me sad and depressed, so any alcoholic beverage I drink despite the alcohol, and not because of. (The good thing about this is that I never need to worry about alcoholism, since in no situation would I want to be *more* sad and depressed.) As well, alcohol is expensive. It's no surprise that I drink so much more [tea](Tea) - on a per-cup basis, it must be an order of magnitude or two cheaper! And teas are usually more tasty too.

As a kid, during some crab-eating, my grandfather gave me Budweiser beer; I found it unspeakably awful. I still do, and only now grudgingly tolerate artisanal beer. Whiskey tastes like oven cleaner. White wines are inoffensive (and hence not worth drinking), while red wines often have an interesting flavor but with punishing bitterness. Brandy is best used as flavoring in eggnog or hot chocolate. I have no opinion on vodka, and [JÃ¤germeister](!Wikipedia) is just odd. [Irish cream](!Wikipedia) was too candy-like. I rather enjoyed the 2 [ice wine](!Wikipedia)s I've had, but it's rare and expensive.

Finally, I tried some [mead](!Wikipedia), and that seems to be the stuff for me! It has a fringe-y reputation thanks to Renaissance Fair-types^[They're generally nice harmless folks, and I enjoy some anachronisms myself like martial arts; I'm just pointing out that "mead" is something of a punchline or joke.], but mead tastes good regardless. Mead is not common, though, and being alcoholic and subject to countless burdensome regulations, mead is also pretty hard to get. I spent many hours searching for mead sources, and the upshot was that essentially no mead seller ships to New York State. This meant that the ~30 interesting-looking meads on [Vinoshipper.com](http://www.vinoshipper.com) were useless to me. I thought of sending them to my grandparents in Maryland since I occasionally visit, but of the 30, only 2 varieties ship to Maryland! S&H doubled the price since they would ship separately! Well, that's no good. I had heard of a local mead maker, the [LI Meadery](http://www.limeadery.com/), so I turned eagerly to their website and learned... they closed a few months before after something like a decade of business. Gosh darn it! This left me one last source: [Earle Estates Meadery](http://www.meadery.com/). So I ordered 10 meads and a wine from them for a total of $196.
