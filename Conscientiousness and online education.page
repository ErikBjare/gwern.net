[Online education](!Wikipedia) like [Khan Academy](!Wikipedia) has been hailed as a major innovation which will revolutionize higher & lower education, educate students better, and cut costs. But in general, it seems unlikely that online education will reduce all costs equally and educate all students equally better. Hardly any change ever preserves all relative positions or ratios - someone benefits disproportionately, someone benefits only a little.

So what differentials can we expect from online education? Hoary articles from the '90s about the '[digital divide](!Wikipedia)' might make one predict that it will benefit middle and upper-class whites; but on the other hand, proponents love to talk about favored minorities (eg. a foreign black female - that is, a girl in an African village) who can now access online education through cheap cellphones, so one might predict that online education will instead level the playing field. No longer will there be a big gap between receiving essentially no education and receiving a real education, a gap that perpetuates cycles of poverty. As Internet access becomes *more* common than access to quality schools, quality school delivered through the Internet will lead to an equalizing effect (the elites will be no better off than before, and the non-elites now have the chance to obtain a prerequisite to becoming an elite).

# Success factors

It may help to ask what causes success in education and see how online education affects it. To a first approximation, ignoring environment, one earns educational success through:

1. [IQ](!Wikipedia)/_g_

    IQ obviously predicts a huge chunk of educational success (leading to the ironic accusation that IQ tests are only academic questions) since the smarter one is, the easier learning anything is, much less one's schoolwork.
2. [Conscientiousness](About#fn26) (a personality trait in the [Big Five](!Wikipedia "Conscientiousness#Personality models"); of the hard work, grit, effort)

    If one is not smart enough that one can simply inhale lessons and pass tests, one still has the option of *working hard*: doing extra practice problems, asking for help, etc. Success will not come easy, but it will still come. These 2 factors together will correlate somewhere like 0.7 with educational success: someone who is smart and hard-working will go to the top, and someone who is stupid and lazy will not.
3. Miscellaneous

    The rest of the correlation is made up of socioeconomic status, culture (eg. East Asian?) and [random other things](http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Turkheimer.Nonshared-Environment.pt1.pdf "'Nonshared Environment: A Theoretical, Methodological, and Quantitative Review', Turkheimer & Waldron 2000"): life events, available wealth, environmental factors like an extra-inspiring teacher, etc.

# Online education's factors

How does online education affect them - reducing the need for that factor to reach a certain level of attainment, leaving it alone, or increasing the need for that factor?

1. IQ seems like it could go any way:

    - Any effects could roughly cancel out, perhaps in some sort of compensating mechanism where students only aim at particular levels of mastery or performance and better or worse methods only change how much time they need to invest before they go off to play video games.
    - It could increase the need for IQ, because now all the extraneous time-wasting 'gunk' like sharpening pencils or doing roll-call can be cleared away by the technical solutions, leaving more time for pure learning. By eliminating all the environmental hindrances and variation, the only variation left will come from the student's innate intellectual abilities: IQ. Students will race through courses until they hit their natural limits; even Sal Khan's videos can't make a dim bulb calculate solutions to Schrodinger's equation.

        It has been noted in the psychometric literature that successful attempts to eliminate socio-economic penalties and provide quality environments for all children would necessarily *increase* the apparent contribution of heredity: if every child is in an environment that lets them develop and flourish to their fullest extent, then any remaining differences in their development will be due to hereditary factors! If variations in IQ are the joint product of variations in heredity and environment, then eliminating all variation in environment, setting environment to 0, means the remaining variation will be just the variation in heredity.
    - It could reduce the need for IQ, since online education will lead to a marketplace of lessons where only the clearest, most insightful, easily understood lessons survive. In ordinary classrooms staffed by ordinary teachers, extemporaneous lectures or explanations are necessarily more opaque and lower-quality compared to a lecture that the world-class presenter has spent months or years honing.

        But it is a utopian thought that perhaps everyone will be successful at education; so the question becomes, what trait or environmental factor would then become the best predictor of attainment? If you reduce the need for brains, then perhaps you still need motivation and appetite for work, which in conjunction with the previous point about joint products leads us to the next observations...
2. Conscientiousness is the joker. There is one clear possible change: online education will *increase* demand for Conscientiousness compared to offline education.

    This tallies with my personal experience with online courses and classes with online assignment components like computer science classes (where class attendance may be optional and programming projects or homework are submitted remotely). I had a good deal of trouble just sitting down to do the course or assignment, even though it was not necessarily that difficult. The distractions on my laptop beckoned: I would go use crufty old Solaris boxes in the computer labs just to avoid the distractions and get something done.

    There is also some academic research supporting this suggestion, which compare online and offline performance and also collect personality data^[In studies which don't collect the necessary information on Conscientiousness, I believe it *may* be possible to observe this effect by looking at standard deviations in the scores: the online class should have a greater range, as the un-Conscientious flunk out by doing less while the Conscientious thrive on the optimized presentation. On the other hand, it could be that the online class has higher averages and similar standard deviations, and the un-Conscientious just tend to make up the lower half of the test scores, so standard deviations don't seem like a reliable indicator. Unfortunate, since there are many more studies comparing online and offline education than do that while also collecting personality data.]; I currently know of 4 relevant studies[^Elvers-2003][^Kim-2004][^Schniederjans-2005][^Bassili-2006].
3. Miscellaneous is too varied and heterogeneous to be predictable, so we won't discuss it further.

[^Elvers-2003]: From ["Procrastination in Online Courses: Performance and Attitudinal Differences"](http://campus.udayton.edu/~psych/DJP/scholarship/ToP_2003.pdf), Elvers et al 2003; result:

    > There were no reliable differences between the 2 sections of the class on the measures of procrastination, exam performance, or attitudes toward the class. Yet, procrastination was negatively related with exam scores and with attitudes toward the class for the online students, but not for the lecture students. This difference may partially explain why online courses designed to increase the educational efficacy of a course often show no difference in performance when compared to lecture classes.

    Background:

    > If procrastination is a problem in online classes, it would be desirable to know which students are most at risk for procrastination. Instructors could then offer the at-risk students interventions designed to reduce dilatory behaviors. Watson (2001) and Schouwenburg and Lay (1995) correlated self-reported procrastination with five factors of personality. Both found a reliable relation between self-reported procrastination and low conscientiousness. Watson found a reliable relation between procrastination and neuroticism. Schouwenburg and Lay also found some, but not all, facets of neuroticism to be related to procrastination.

    What did the students say and what difference was found in their scores?

    > One question asked in the end-of-semester questionnaire was whether the student disliked the class because it was easy to get behind in the class. In the online class, 19 of 21 students reported that they disliked the class because it was easy to get behind. Only 13 of 23 students in the lecture class reported that they disliked the class because it was easy to get behind...However, the magnitude of the relation between procrastination and class performance and attitudes seemed to be larger for the online class than for the traditional class. Procrastination was a good predictor of performance for each of the five tests in the class for the online students, but not a good predictor of performance for any of the five tests for the lecture students.

    Finally, the quote that really sums it all up:

    > "Pedagogy suggests that activities such as online discussions, group writing projects, and immediate feedback on performance should lead to better performance. Thus, students in online classes, which often contain these activities, should have better performance in the class compared to traditional lecture classes, which often lack these activities. However, this is rarely the case. Russell (1999) cited more than 300 studies that failed to find any reliable difference in performance between traditional classes and classes at a distance (including correspondence courses, online courses, and telecourses). The observation that the magnitude of the relation between procrastination and exam scores was larger in this online class than in the lecture class could be a possible explanation for these null results. The additional activities in online classes that should increase performance may do just that. However, the decrements associated with dilatory behaviors in online classes may attenuate the increments associated with the additional activities. By reducing dilatory behaviors, the benefits of online classes may become more apparent."
[^Kim-2004]: Kim & Schniederjans 2004, ["The role of personality characteristics in web-based distance education courses"](/docs/2004-kim.pdf): in its sample of 140 students, online education worked best for those high on the Wonderlic PCI Success Scales for 'Commitment to Work' ("The tendency to remain on a job for a long time, and not be undependable, irresponsible, impulsive, disorganized, or lack persistence.") and 'Learning Orientation' ("The tendency of an individual to be willing to engage in activities to acquire knowledge, skills, and behaviors and to learn new methods and procedures to improve job effectiveness, how interested they are in developing themselves, seek opportunities to learn new and different ways of doing things, and enrolled in training programs that they are likely to be active and fully engaged participants.")
[^Schniederjans-2005]: Schniederjans & Kim 2005, ["Relationship of Student Undergraduate Achievement and Personality Characteristics in a Total Web-Based Environment: An Empirical Study"](/docs/2005-schniederjans.pdf); similar to Kim & Schniederjans 2004, 260 students. It found Conscientiousness significant, but also 3 others (Openness, Neuroticism, and Openness) and not Extraversion. (Neither seems to include any effect size or whether Conscientiousness out-predicts the other factors; this may be due to my inability to interpret some of the provided statistics.)
[^Bassili-2006]: Bassili 2006, ["Promotion and prevention orientations in the choice to attend lectures or watch them online"](http://weboption.utsc.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/Student_Characteristics_in_JCAL_12_06.pdf) measured only Neuroticism and Openness, so cannot tell us anything about Conscientiousness.

# Factor changes

Now, we discarded #3 as being impossible to generalize about, and #2 suggests that Conscientiousness will increase in its correlation with success, while to me the more plausible outcome for #1 is that it will reduce the need. But to be conservative, let's assume the need for IQ remains unchanged. This suggests the following argument:

1. Material presented in an online education format: requires the same amount of IQ to understand[^better-material-limits]
2. Material presented in an online education format: also requires more Conscientiousness than the same material presented in a classroom
3. there are no other factors; *then*
4. less of the general population will be able to learn it.

[^better-material-limits]: One wonders how much hope can we place in the falsity of #1. Just how much *can* education's IQ requirements be brought down? Advocates seem optimistic, but is the current material all that bad? How dumb can you be before even the best highest-quality of calculus becomes unlearnable with feasible amounts of time and effort on your part? How close are existing online courses to this lower bound on IQ? At what point does #1 resume being true?

To belabor the obvious and dress it up in mathematical garb: for a particular static set/population Z, the number of Z members which satisfy the requirements  $IQ + C < IQ + (C+1)$, because the fraction of the population with both the necessary IQ and the necessary Conscientiousness must be equal to or smaller than the fraction with just the necessary IQ; for any properties $P(a \wedge b) \le P(a)$. See also the [conjunction fallacy](!Wikipedia).

(A major caveat here is that the premises really do need absolute values of IQ and Conscientiousness. If you only have correlations, I believe it is possible for IQ's correlation for educational success remain the same and Conscientiousness's correlation go up while the fraction of the general population succeeding goes up *also*. For example, if online education reduced the need for Conscientiousness, but reduced the need for IQ even more, more people will pass by the opposite of our conjunctive reasoning, but any attempt to predict success will need less information about IQ and more about Conscientiousness.)

Now, to discuss claim #2 in more detail. The first study cited previously on online education stressing Conscientiousness, Elvers 2003, is particularly interesting (see the quotes in the footnote). Now, given the evidence from this study that online education scores correlate with Conscientiousness, it seems very likely that #2 is true. However, the result that the online students had the same average as the offline students indicates that the conclusion #4 is not true; the obvious candidate to reject via modus tollens is assumption #1. As one would hope! But if #1 is not true, it could be true to a very large degree - as already mentioned, computerized education could make education a lot less correlated with your raw IQ because it's presented better or whatever (to listen to the most rapturous users of Khan Academy). However, the *equality* in scores between the online and offline classes indicates that whatever the drop in IQ requirements, it was offset by the increase in Conscientiousness requirements.

What does this tradeoff between loading on Conscientiousness and IQ suggest?

1. First, it suggests that blended learning will be intermediate in results: I'd expect partial online education to be 'weaker' than full online education.

    You have to force yourself to go to class, but then it's still easier to learn without burdening your willpower/Conscientiousness. (You can always, say, not bring your laptop to class - difficult or impossible with online education!) I'd expect the effect of non-mandatory to be intermediate, much like I'd expect frequent mandatory deadlines in online education to help only a little.
2. Second, if one lone course shows such a hit from lack of Conscientiousness, what happens as ever more material goes online and students might be expected to do entire semesters just online?

    Will we see the correlation go up, as students expend all their willpower and run completely dry (see eg. Baumeister & Tierney 2010, _Willpower_)? (You may be able to lift one weight up to your head, but if given 10 weights simultaneously, you drop them all.) It seems that the tradeoff might extend well beyond a single course to all courses.

# Consequences

Is loading outcome more on Conscientiousness a bad thing? I think it is, for a few reasons, some of which follow directly from the tradeoff and some of which are speculation about future consequences:

1. there is no particular reason to favor Conscientiousness as an additional reward for 'good' people. Whether we should favor it over IQ depends on the *consequences* such as what mental traits we need more of in our elites.

    Conscientiousness is not a 'virtue' in the sense that the (non-existent) homunculus in your brain is 'good' or 'bad' for choosing to be Conscientious or not, any more than it is morally laudable to be high IQ than low IQ. Despite [folk psychology & moralizing](http://medicalhypotheses.blogspot.com/2009_08_01_archive.html "Reliable but dumb, or smart but slapdash?"), the Big Five personality traits are stable over lifetimes like IQ, are turning out to be influenced by heredity like IQ, and progress is being made on tracing the traits to the underlying neurological factors like IQ. You can no more 'try hard to be able to try hard' (how circular) than you can try hard to be more intelligent.
2. As already observed, the school system already [rewards](http://medicalhypotheses.blogspot.com/2009/05/do-elite-us-colleges-choose-personality.html "Do elite US colleges choose personality over IQ?") Conscientious grinds, and [oppresses creativity](http://itari.in/categories/Creativity/19.pdf "'Creativity: Asset or burden in the classroom?', Westby & Dawson 1995"). Do we need to make the former even more true? Think of how this will penalize [bright creative potential-future-great-scientists](http://kernull.com/bioradio.pdf "Why are modern scientists so dull? How science selects for perseverance and sociability at the expense of intelligence and creativity") - but uninterested in forcing themselves to do mandated drudgework - nerds. ([Conscientiousness is necessary](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9m6/the_personality_of_greatcreative_scientists_open/ "The Personality of (great/creative) Scientists: Open and Conscientious") for scientific greatness, but not *that* much.)

    It's worth noting that a little appreciated property of the bell curve or normal distribution is that a very small shift in the average can have unintuitively large consequences at the tails: a shift of 1 IQ point in the general population can result in considerable changes in the population all the way out at, say, 160+ IQs. We can grasp this by looking at the [changes in rarity](!Wikipedia "Normal distribution#Standard deviation and confidence intervals") by standard deviation: someone at 2 deviations is 1 in 22, 3 deviations 1 in 370, 4 = 1 in 15,787 (42x fewer than 3), and 5 = 1 in 1,744,277 (110x fewer than 4). A common standard deviation for particular IQ tests is 15 points, so 3 deviations out is ~145 IQ, which is around the observed minimum for great Nobel-winning scientific or mathematical work^[When this is mentioned, some wit often tries to bring up [Richard Feynman](!Wikipedia)'s supposed IQ score in the 130s; while this is obvious bunk (a case of "one man's modus ponens is another man's modus tollens"), [a closer look at the source](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1251164) of the anecdote reveals many reasons why the score is either false or unreliable.]. This is interesting because some interventions like [iodization](!Wikipedia "Iodised salt") can have [shockingly large effects on IQ](Nootropics#iodine) in the worst-off environments - such as an average increase of as much as 15 IQ points - which would suggest that if a hypothetical intervention moved a population a standard deviation from 85 to 100 IQ, its subpopulation at 145 goes from being 4 deviations away to 3 - which increases that subpopulation's ranks by 42x or 4200%![^Jensen] (One meta-analysis of iodine effects, Scrimshaw 1998, apparently did find a shift of the overall bell curve; and further, iodization benefits females more than males, so there may have been nontrivial consequences there...)

    The implications are obvious for any academic system that forced its membership's average IQ down a few points in exchange for researchers higher on Conscientiousness: it may have outsized effect on how much of its membership are the very smartest researchers around.
3. The tradeoff resulting in online education favoring Conscientiousness was neither designed in nor realized by the designers; it is purely accidental and undesired. Wouldn't it be extraordinary if an accidental tradeoff turned out to be exactly optimal? How very convenient!

    This is a good time to apply the [status-quo reversal test](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reversal_test): suppose online education did not result in any such tradeoff but a Khan Academy staffer unilaterally made some changes meant solely to make KA scores reflect Conscientiousness more (perhaps your progress would be deleted if you did not Conscientiously log in every week and do a few problems). Would you approve of this change? Suppose further online education actually reduced the need for Conscientiousness (maybe because the service pings your cellphone with a quick practice problem every so often); would you approve of the staffer's change then? If you would not approve in the latter scenario where the shift along the tradeoff curve is intentional, why would you approve of a shift caused accidentally?
4. The cheapness of online education may prove irresistible and a case of [worse is better](!Wikipedia): the cost of human teachers is nontrivial and may be increasing (whether this is due to backloaded pension compensation, growth of the education sector & diminishing returns, [Baumol's cost disease](!Wikipedia) etc.), and this has prompted reactions like the death of university tenure & wholesale use of adjuncts, attacks on unions, and interest in automated methods of teaching... like online education. Already cuts have begun. Even if online education is worse, there may be no choice about whether to use it or not - a sort of educational [enclosure](!Wikipedia) movement. This shift may or may not be economically efficient (if the public sector is able to force the losses onto the public which is not organized enough to avoid it, perhaps due to ideological divisions).
5. Economic growth is increasingly captured in the US by the most-educated, with income growth going mostly to graduate degree holders. So anything which may lessen the ranks of the most highly educated seems like it would exacerbate the inequality of returns to education. Is some general increases in the net wealth of the economy worth it? People do not eat absolute wealth increases, they eat relative increases - more egalitarian economies are happier populaces. (Note the same question can be asked of other 'cheaper' things like globalization and outsourcing, and the answer in those other cases is not trivial. [Pareto-efficient](!Wikipedia) does not mean everyone is better off, just that no one is worse off, and this assumes humans do not care about their rankings or place - a patently false approximation.)

[^Jensen]: [Arthur Jensen](!Wikipedia), [discussing the slight deviations](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.138.980&rep=rep1&type=pdf "'How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?' 1969") from the bell curve in real-world populations at the extremes (<70 and >140) points out the consequence of shifting the means:

    > Examination of this normal curve can be instructive if one notes the consequences of shifting the total distribution up or down the IQ scale. The consequences of a give shift become more extreme out toward the "tails" of the distribution. For example, shifting the mean of the distribution from 100 down to 90 would put 50 percent instead of only 25 percent of the population below IQ 90; and it would put 9 percent instead of 2 percent below IQ 70. And in the upper tail of the distribution, of course, the consequences would be the reverse; instead of 25 percent above IQ 110, there would be only 9 percent, and so on. The point is that relatively small shifts in the mean of the IQ distribution can result in very large differences in the proportions of the population that fall into the very low or the very high ranges of intelligence. A 10 point downward shift in the mean, for example, would more than triple the percentage of mentally retarded (IQs below 70) in the population and would reduce the percentage of the intellectually "gifted" (IQs above 130) to less than one-sixth of their present number. It is in these tails of the normal distribution that differences become most conspicuous between various groups in the population that show mean IQ differences, for whatever reason, of only a few IQ points. From a knowledge of relatively slight mean differences between various social class and ethnic groups, for example, one can estimate quite closely the relatively large differences in their proportions in special classes for the educationally retarded and for the "gifted" and in the percentages of different groups receiving scholastic honors at graduation. It is simply a property of the normal distribution that the effects of group differences in the mean are greatly magnified in the different proportions of each group that we find as we move further out toward the upper or lower extremes of the distribution.
    >
    > I indicated previously that the distribution of intelligence is really not quite "normal," but show certain systematic departures from "normality." These departures from the normal distribution are shown in Figure 2 in a slightly exaggerated form to make them clear. The shaded area is the normal distribution; the heavy line indicates the actual distribution of IQs in the population. We note that there are more very low IQs than would be expected in a truly normal distribution and also there is an excess of IQs at the upper end of the scale. Note, too, the slight excess in the IQ range between about 70 and 90.
    >
    > ...The "excess" of IQs at the high end of the scale is certainly a substantial phenomenon, but it has not yet been adequately accounted for. In his multifactorial theory of the inheritance of intelligence, Burt (1958) has postulated major gene effects that make for exceptional intellectual abilities represented at the upper end of the scale, just as other major gene effects make for the subnormality found at the extreme lower end of the scale. One might also hypothesize that superior genotypes for intellectual development are pushed to still greater superiority in their phenotypic expression through interaction with the environment. Every recognition of superiority leads to its greater cultivation and encouragement by the individual's social environment. This influence is keenly evident in the developmental histories of persons who have achieved exceptional eminence (Goertzel & Goertzel, 1962). Still another possible explanation of the upper-end "excess" lies in the effects of [assortative mating](!Wikipedia) in the population, meaning the tendency for "like to marry like." If the degree of resemblance in intelligence between parents in the upper half of the IQ distribution were significantly greater than the degree of resemblance of parents in the below average range, genetic theory would predict the relative elongation of the upper tail of the distribution. This explanation, however, must remain speculative until we have more definite evidence of whether there is differential assortative mating in different regions of the IQ distribution.
    >
    > ...The reason is simply that assortative mating increases the genetic variance in the population. By itself this will not affect the mean of the trait in the population, but it will have a great effect on the proportion of the population falling in the upper and lower tails of the distribution. Under present conditions, with an assortative mating coefficient of about .60, the standard deviation of IQs is 15 points. If assortative mating for intelligence were reduced to zero, the standard deviation of IQs would fall to 12.9. The consequences of this reduction in the standard deviation would be most evident at the extremes of the intelligence distribution. For example, assuming a normal distribution if IQs and the present standard deviation of 15, the frequency (per million) of persons above IQ 130 is 22,750. Without assortative mating the frequency of IQs over 130 would fall to 9,900, or only 43.5 percent of the present frequency. For IQs above 145, the frequency (per million) is 1,350 and with no assortative mating would fall to 241, or 17.9 percent of the present frequency. And there are now approximately 20 times as many persons above an IQ of 160 as we would find if there were no assortative mating for intelligence.^3^

What other consequences may there be?

> This prodigious event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars - and yet they have done it themselves.
