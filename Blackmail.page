> In September 2012, I was extorted for $32; I declined to pay. In November 2013, I called an encryption bluff. In December 2013, a crazy person tried to blackmail me for billions of dollars; I declined to pay.

I have long been interested in cryptographic topics, and in June 2011, I began researching the new black-markets, as epitomized by [Silk Road]() (SR). Between my sustained coverage of black-market topics, occasional interventions like my Sheep-MarketPlace/BlackMarket-Reloaded bet, and my minor role in the doxing of Sheep MarketPlace's owner, and my essay [Bitcoin is Worse is Better](), I have been sometimes accused of being more involved than I appear - possibly Dread Pirate Roberts (really Ross Ulbricht), [Satoshi Nakamoto](!Wikipedia), a high-level seller, a law enforcement agent, or other things.

While sometimes flattering (I wish I was Satoshi Nakamoto), these are all quite wrong: I am but an impoverished writer who barely makes ends meet, and certainly not a Bitcoin billionaire. Still, some tinge of notoriety can be useful if it means people are willing to tell me private information. On the other hand, sometimes it is just plain irritating. They don't always go anywhere. Here are 3 examples of things that went nowhere, or at least, not where I wanted them to go.

### 10 September

<!-- TODO: link on LW: http://lesswrong.com/lw/j8f/anonymous_feedback_forms_revisited/  -->

On 10 September 2012, I returned from my dinner to discover in my inbox news of a message someone sent me at 4:55PM using my [anonymous feedback form](About#anonymous-feedback):

> gwern \
> I signed up usernames "gwern" and "gwernbranwen" at pivory.com \
> I will release login info to you for a ransom. \
> The ransom value decreases over time following exponential decay with a half-life of 365/2=182.5 days. \
> It starts at 32 USD on 2012-09-11. I'll allow a 1 day precision. \
> Payment is to be sent as Bitcoin using MtGox average price to 1LtiftPcu3AjTbXf2XFCbvNTaeRFL1yBAy \
> After 365 days I will start using the accounts. \
> notgwern@tormail.org

Oh no! I was being extorted over a username on some forum site called [Pivory](http://pivory.com/). Was I going to pay up $32 to rescue my doppelganger from the clutches of a sinister extortionist? Did he plan to post threats against the President or child porn on this site to besmirch my good name? I knew I had to act swiftly to stanch the damage!

I told him no.

More precisely, I posted the following signed message [to Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/5p1G9CZPBxR) and a private mailing list, publicly committing to not paying him a single satoshi:

    > It starts at 32 USD on 2012-09-11. I'll allow a 1 day precision.

    > notgwern@tormail.org

    Your message in my anonymous site feedback form leaves me deeply
    amused, and I applaud your courtesy in setting the 365-day ransom at a
    modest $8 (2 half-lives from $32); but I'm afraid I must decline your
    offer permanently.

    Since there are indefinitely many Internet sites which allow user
    signups and publicly visible comments, accepting an extortion on any
    of them for any amount exposes me to indefinitely large losses. Hence
    by backward induction, there is a clear decision-theoretic verdict
    against paying you any sum.

### Discussion

One curious aspect was that the payment *declined* with time, rather than, as one would expect, *increase* with time as a penalty. [Michael O'Kelly](https://plus.google.com/+MichaelOKelly/about) in the Google+ comments pointed out that the scheme was also in conflict with [option-value](!Wikipedia "Option value (cost benefit analysis)")/learning:

> Am I missing something, or would it make more sense for the ransom to *increase* exponentially?  You will only really be tempted to pay if Pivory becomes the hot new thing, which becomes less ambiguous with time.

I theorized that it was not motivated by a particular economic or decision-theoretic consideration, but more of a psychological hack:

> Michael: I figured it was an attempt to hack convenience; if I paid up quickly, he'd make the most. Most people would not be patient enough to wait. (You're right that you and I would choose a compounding strategy, like any regular extortionist, to instead incentivize quick payment by all sorts of people.)
>
> Of course, he must not know me very well, because if he did, he would've known that I would simply put payment on my calendar for a year from now and pay as little as possible, or better yet, wait for him to actually start using the accounts and only paying up if it looked like he could do some damage with it.

[Арсений Алексеев](https://plus.google.com/113212242446665079433/) pointed out an additional failing if we took the psychological view, that the extortionist provided a clear deadline and so there was less incentive to pay to reduce uncertainty (dislike of uncertainty seems related to [loss aversion](!Wikipedia)):

> You would be tempted to pay early if the ending date was unknown. I am surprised he made that public.

Finally, [Joshua Zelinsky](https://plus.google.com/103374245285362725470) speculated on broader implications of the extortionist's failure:

> This suggests that people only take [exponential discounting](!Wikipedia) seriously when it isn't made explicit. If one thinks that [hyperbolic discounting](!Wikipedia) makes more sense though then this ransom doesn't really work.

### Outcome

I made 2 predictions about how my anonymous extortionist would react to my public declaration:

1. He will reply: [65%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8217)

    If he spent the time registering the username and contacting me, after such a rebuke, I expected a reply if only to justify his peculiar payment schedule. Unfortunately, I was wrong and as of 15 December 2013, I have not heard a peep from him, and further, the Bitcoin address [`1LtiftPcu3AjTbXf2XFCbvNTaeRFL1yBAy`](https://blockchain.info/address/1LtiftPcu3AjTbXf2XFCbvNTaeRFL1yBAy) has been inactive since.
2. He will not attempt a second extortion: [65%](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/8218)

    As I said at the time, "if it didn't work the first time, why would it work elsewhere?" Indeed. I'd said no and given a general explanation of why I *could not* pay for the entire class of extortion attempts.

I paid nothing and suffered no harm, so I regard this mostly as an amusing example of the use of Bitcoin for extortion.

## DPR?
### 7 November

At 5:13PM I received a curious PM on Reddit:

> Sorry for all the trouble I caused. I know I fuck up alot. This privnote contains everything to cover your ass, its how I connected you to you. https://privnote.com/n/mhstglglfojgxgqb/#opzcvoxulwcwlskl Sorry for fucking up what you had.

Although i'm sure thats not enough. Don't worry. I won't ever say your name again.

The Privnote link seemed to contain the same PGP-encrypted message, both encrypted to "RSA key, ID 28820345" - not a key I had or whose ID I recognized. My initial guess was that he thought he had linked my Gwern pseudonym to a black-market operator (presumably either an employee of the recently-deceased Silk Road or as an operator of the then-recently-opened Silk Road 2. Other possibilities included BlackMarket Reloaded or Sheep MarketPlace.) I can say this due to the bit about "You won't let me vend proper": since I am entirely uninvolved in running the black markets and I generally only document vendors after they've been busted, it is improbable I as Gwern interfered with his selling, and that then means he must think I'm someone else.

I'm really curious why he thinks I'm running a black market but the problem is, I can't decrypt his message and if I tell him that, then it sounds like I'm really am the person he thinks I secretly am and I'm bullshitting him. I'm also curious what trouble he caused 'me' because I've never heard of this nick before. So here was the plan I decided on to deal with him: I tell him his message is malformed on both Reddit & Privnote (which it is), tell him how to format it for Reddit (indent every line by 4 spaces), and tell him to use my ['public' identity's key](Links#contact). Hopefully he'll take this as a legitimate technical glitch, re-encrypt to a key I actually have, and then I'll know what he's talking about. If he gets spooked by my 'apparent' inability to decrypt the message, then he wasn't really convinced I am 'me' in the first place and I don't especially care what his arguments or facts were.

An hour later, I replied:

> I do not know what you are talking about, and certainly would not be able to decrypt that message. You should use my public key http://www.gwern.net/Links#contact if you have something to say to me.
>
> Also, your message is malformed on both Reddit & Privnote: you need to indent each line by 4 spaces and then it'll work fine.

I really liked the coyness of that first line: I think that's perfectly worded to sound like I know *exactly* what he's talking about but I'm insisting on the re-encryption as a butt-saving maneuver.

### 8 November

I waited with great eagerness for the reply to learn how exactly 'I' was being blackmailed or extorted or doxed, only to be told:

> The entire text of the first message I sent you was copy/pasted.
>
> I was sent that message by someone who claims to know the identity of DPR. I'm not too advanced with PGP only recently learning it, but I believe it is formatted for DPR PGP key so neither of us will be able to decrypt it. He falsely believed I was someone else after I impersonated an individual he asked to contact him. I was simply trolling awaiting the launch of the new road.
>
> I know the name of the person he is claiming to be DPR and he did show me some convincing evidence but I neglected to save any of the pictures out of lack of belief. Now I'm beginning to think he may have been right because of how quickly I was censored when I tried to divulge this information.
>
> I am honestly undecided as to whether or not I want to poke at the issue, as I'm solely a simple customer from the original SR and a sailing ship is good enough for me. But this information was posted on Reddit more than once after the registration suspension on the official forums. That said, law enforcement has definitely seen what was disseminated and if it's true, it is in the best interest of everyone to uncover it before LE become involved once again.
>
> I contacted you because I've read good things about you on the forums after researching who you were following your encrypted info post last week. If you wish to discuss any of this further, message me back and we'll move to a more secure platform and I can share with you what I was told and you can followup in an attempt to determine its veracity. Thank you for your time.

I was terribly disappointed: he had been bluffing me! He couldn't decrypt the message either and had no more idea than I did what was in it. And his theory wasn't terribly plausible: I *did* have DPR's official public key, but it was the key ID 67B7FA25, not key ID 28820345 (as I said, the message hadn't matched any of the public or private keys I've collected over the years).

I replied pointing out the key ID issue and linking him to m public key for further discussion. He never replied. <!-- Pinged 15 December 2013 -->

This section is an example of something I hoped would be a useful lead, but which turned out to be a nuisance. (Messages below have their original formatting preserved as much as possible; where relevant, encrypted messages are decrypted and several successive comments by a party are combined into a single blockquote.)


On 10 December 2013, I visited Reddit to discover in my inbox a peculiar message:

> ["The momentum of moments..." from jack0fnone sent 57 minutes ago]
>
> Not your typical dox. https://privnote.com/n/tgczkzspwnindyfw/#bhbmxmqrdedwkukh

I for one have come to be incredibly fascinated by the conviction you've demonstrate thus far, and fully stand by your side. I do offend easily, but I'm also quite forgetful when recognized by opportunity. It's truly been fascinating!
>
> Objectively, jack0fnone

Most peculiar. Not your typical dox - prophetic words. `jack0fnone` was not a nick I recognized, a quick Google turned up nothing but a probable false positive in some kid's gamertag, and I did not recognize the Bitcoin address [`15bD6fYs6p9D9wmniDtTBcQSyWXDYNDCwv`](https://blockchain.info/address/15bD6fYs6p9D9wmniDtTBcQSyWXDYNDCwv) (which turned out to have no transactions). This sounded like it could be anything - perhaps a dox of BlackMarket Reloaded's `backopy`? I knew my SMP informant had been looking into BMR, and while this prose didn't sound like him, I didn't have much to base that guess on.

Naturally, I opened the `Privnote.com` link to read the full message:

> How much time are we ever really guaranteed? So many beautiful ideas to explore and exploit in this brief lifetime. Wouldn't you agree? \
> To realize that it all could have been for something more than absolutely nothing is the way by which we must pride ourselves to exchange a dialogue someday I assume. \
> I wonder if your sheer brilliance will demonstrate itself to be as resilient this time around, great minds can create true revolutions when they work together in secrecy. \
> I come offering you an economy of grand scale, a lifetime of secrecy, friendship, and a fast paced blueprint to successfully rid everyone of these tremendous frustrations. \
> With so much to lose, I am wondering whether everyone is still on track for a contingency plan in Cyprus.
>
> I too can change the world, sometimes we must pretend to believe it's for the better for reality to catch up to truth--I'm sure you understand. I do not approach you or your team with opposition, only a motivation which I see to be purer than yours. I don't feel anything truly needs to be discussed. I negotiate in the same way that all of you have, and with that sworn statement, I will take just this one wallet off of your hands and present a plan more motivating and functional (1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a) My meddling in your teams current affairs is of little importance, but to validate the idea of a scam coin and expose it's truths would not only leave identities and reputations crippled, it would inevitably destroy a foundation that can most certainly be reconciled in these early stages. The alternative route will give you a chance to thoroughly describe this short lived con under your organized list of "mistakes".
>
> I most certainly am the guy you are looking for, and if not I am forever inclined to be the one you're looking out for. I would strongly urge against vocalizing your concerns or findings any further in the various communities which you grace as a form of mitigating the future risks you assume to be impending. My unequivocal opinion is that we should continue to change the climate and attitude in a way that doesn't hinder the progress of this crypto (specifically Bitcoin) movement in places where it is desperately needed. I cannot stress the importance of timeliness as I am eagerly anticipating the expected denial phase that is to come! I, however, am confident that our negotiations have pleasantly concluded; for better or worse, I would avoid focusing on the rationale at this point. It would serve you well to have me on your side these next few months, as I've decided it would be an absolute insult and tragic succession of events the following months to have this move forward in any other manner. Similarly I offer the option of ceasing to exist if you so choose to not dignify this partnership I would hope to develop.

Well. That was ominous. I recognized the address [`1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a`](https://blockchain.info/address/1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a) as being the notorious lost treasure of Dread Pirate Roberts - the ฿111,114 (~$92,224,620) the FBI failed to confiscate using Ross Ulbricht's laptop. Did Jack think I was the *real* DPR and Ross a patsy or minor employee? Certainly the mention of "team" suggested I had ongoing operations and that he might think I was the DPR2 running SR2, but I didn't know what might be meant by "scam coin". More disturbing was the sentence mentioning my "organized list of 'mistakes'", which was a clear allusion to [Mistakes]() and evidence that this was a targeted message and not some indiscriminate broadcast to, say, all Redditors who commented on SR-related articles. Regardless, this is a clear blackmail attempt.

How to respond? I have no secret identities worth paying to keep secret, I do not possess ฿111,114 (heck, I don't even possess ฿111), and if I did, did he seriously think that I would pay up immediately on getting such a cryptic threat? Now, I know he must be wrong in whatever his accusation is, but that doesn't mean his information is worthless: he could have still stumbled over valuable information, even if his conclusion is wrong. And the purple prose was inherently amusing (if a little disturbing in its own way - "What frightens us most in a madman is his sane conversation").

How to find out what he knows? I can't simply tell him, "you are wrong, but could you please tell me what information led you to your outlandish conclusion?" I decided to employ the same strategy the last time someone accused me of being DPR: insist on setting up a new public key and talk via that. Naturally, I didn't care about Reddit eavesdropping on our conversation - what do they care about a mistaken dox or obscure bit of black-market trivia? The point was simply to give Jack an impression of guilt: after all, what *innocent* person would bother with such high security measures? Surely only the real DPR would insist on such iron-clad secure communications⸮

I replied briefly:

The postscript confirmed my belief he was blackmailing me, but I couldn't figure out more. He had made the usual error of not formatting the PGP-encrypted message as a code block, so it got wrapped. Even after fixing that, the message was invalid:

    $ xclip -o | gpg --decrypt
    gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID C47A3D09, created 2013-12-11
          "jack0fnone <jack0fnone@safe-mail.net>"
    gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available

It was encrypted to *his* public key? I decided to play security hard-ass, to further the impression of guilt (surely an *innocent* person would suggest simply messaging like normal people and not be so paranoid):

> Please use that key. I don't mean to be rude, but if you cannot compartmentalize and follow basic opsec, there is nothing that can be safely said.

I was a little amused at my roleplaying here: "safely said"? Anything we had to say to each other could be safely said in the clear - I am not DPR, so what do I care? I had to project an image of being technical and high-status, since from reading many post by DPR and Satoshi, I knew they always spoke confidently and calmly. Regardless of my reasoning, this seemed to have the intended effect of lowering his status and he apologized for his error:

> I apologize. I'll admit my competency is far from flawless. I seldom communicate in PGP. What was the exact issue, please? I will have a response ready for you by morning (your time).

His next response was to provide his (malformed) public key:

No, not really, but I fixed it anyway to import `key 024414E5: "jack0fnone <jack0fnone@safe-mail.net>"`, and gave him an encrypted message explaining the issues since he wasn't figuring them out for himself:

This was all perfectly true and the reasons why someone like DPR would act as I was acting. They just had nothing to do with why I was insisting on PGP.

He replied with another malformed PGP-encrypted message... encrypted to his own public key again:

Helpfully, he followed up with a warning:

The requests are as mentioned, very precise and without leniency due to the time sensitive nature of this matter. I will leave this reminder decrypted, your time is highly regarded in all of this. Perhaps we'll have the pleasure of exchanging formalities at some more convenient point.

I might do that if you hadn't screwed up the encryption, Jack! By this point I was getting a little frustrated - if he can't use PGP, how likely is he to know anything worth knowing? - but I persevered, and explained in the clear to him:

His next reply, thankfully, was properly formatted, and so I could import another public key (`key 24E2A726: public key "russiatoday <russia@today>"`) without issue, and this time decrypt his message, at least yielding his blunt statement of what he was after:

Wow. I was wrong: Jack didn't think I was DPR, or SR staff. He thought I was *Satoshi Nakamoto*. Wow. Leaving aside the basic issues with the theory (like how I don't know C++, have little familiarity with cryptocurrencies prior to Bitcoin, certainly wouldn't be living my current lifestyle if I had Nakamoto's estimated ฿800,000, could barely program Java when Nakamoto was starting to work on Bitcoin in 2006 etc), this immediately raised red flags as being megalomaniac, grandiose, and providing precisely zero hard evidence about anything. I have done a little research on Nakamoto myself, and there is nothing Jack could have found in Nakamoto's background which would tie him to me, and that meant it was highly unlikely I could learn anything of value from Jack and I had wasted my time.

On the other hand... how deep did this rabbit hole go? If he thought I was Nakamoto, what on earth led him to him to such a profoundly erroneous conclusion? I admit to a certain interest in diseased thinking (one of my [favorite books](Book reviews) is [Umberto Eco](!Wikipedia)'s _[Foucault's Pendulum](!Wikipedia)_ and I enjoy reading psychology books like Oliver Sack's), and Jack might have a rare gem of conspiracy theorizing if I could but extract it from him. And his purple prose is hilarious (what, does he think he's Moriarty or something?) So, a challenge: could I provoke him into revealing his hand?

I was flabbergasted. I hadn't even heard of half of the names he gave in the first paragraph, or the others (eg. [ZipZap](http://www.coindesk.com/ripple-labs-now-taking-cash-payments-zipzap-snapswap/) is apparently something to do with [Ripple](!Wikipedia "Ripple (monetary system)"), and I had to do some searching to learn even that). Forget the complete absence of the evidence I asked for, this seemed like it was written by someone in the throes of full-blown psychosis or mania or schizophrenia with meaningless plans to somehow revolutionize the world. (But to give Jack his due, some of his lines are hilarious: everyone should have a pet parliament which can be left blushing!) I do not have much experience dealing with crazy people, so I gave the matter some more thought before I replied the next day.

### 12 December

I still hadn't given up on getting the reasons he thought I was Satoshi (or any of the other names he mentioned), so I decided to play along with the writing style and demand evidence and point out his threat to go public in a few days while mocking him as appropriate (since politeness seems futile):

> As you say, I am the author of my own tale, whatever collaborators may invite themselves in to scribble on the parchment. I have read through your suggested emendations, and I have found it wanting for adding to my tale a long chapter flashing back and explaining how I invented Bitcoin years ago and recontextualizing all events since: there is no supporting detail, no successful use of Chekhov's guns or foreshadowing or clues given previously, the plot twist is implausible and trope-heavy, the writing lugubrious and strained. I'm afraid I must reject your submission as requiring many more revisions and drafts, and I wish you the best of luck in finding an editor who will help bring it up to snuff.
>
> I do look forward to your analysis in 8 days, however. While you are not up to pro levels of doxing and you may or may not have a gift for it (the proof is in the pudding), I am always willing to read and give feedback on a well-intentioned amateur's works. So, until then! I thank you for a most amusing evening.

I was disappointed at his reply later that day:

> "While you are not up to pro levels of doxing"
>
> Gwern...you fail to realize that I am not merely trying to prove you're Satoshi (that's the bonus they prove). I stopped having to prove anything about two weeks ago when I found the entire answer in a series of mistakes not you but one that someone else so stupidly committed and all sits still for the entire world to expand upon. The burden of proof forever lies with you Gwern, the defense. You have fabricated several murders. More of my concern honestly, is that Ross is rotting in a cell with everyone else oblivious to your mastermind role. I don't care to reach out to the editors anytime soon hence why I was clear about being friends a couple of months down the road. I am anything but an amateur and this is not some made-up game. I have approached you because the proof is shaking, how long it will take to extradite you is something I bear no concern for. I will make however make sure that before you are locked away for the atrocities you have unabashedly committed today, I have the great pleasure of seeing you swallow such a harsh and unnecessary reality.

I forget.

> I appreciate your ego. Best of luck with the little future that's left. Since we have both expressed our concerns as well as the steps we will take I want it to be clear that I will not be turning back from this point and this entire Ponzi Scheme along with these amateur assumptions of mine will remain neatly compiled in this "fog" of a case we've acknowledged does exist.There is no cryptographic veil under a series of semi-uniformed pseudo-anonymous transactions that will protect you from any of this information when released,or did you think I would be so foolish to show up with the assumption that I owe you any explanation that might actually allow you to take appropriate counter-measures?

More threats, more lack of details, more grandiosity, and he's expanded his claimed details - who is Sunny? What on earth is this "reverse dox" he talks about? Why did he reference my _Death Note_ essays (and which one, anyway, [Death Note Anonymity]() or [Death Note script]()?)? I have no interest in a Ferrari, and I do not live in New York at the moment, and I sincerely doubt that Ross Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc has received any visit from Jack. But there are some rhetorical gems of purple prose in here that remind me why I led Jack on: I could never have written a line like "my intelligence at hand, in fact, exceeded yours by an order that is as expected is unimaginable.". An order as *expected* as it is *unimaginable*! The mind reels.

I indulged myself with further mockery (and some _[Umineko no Naku Koro ni](!Wikipedia)_ allusions since I was starting to feel a little like Beatrice) in my reply:

> Dear Author: as your most dedicated reader, I perused the latest installment of your ongoing serial with utmost interest, yet I felt somehow disappointed when I came to the end. Meta-fiction is a difficult genre to work in and requires a deft hand; in particular, one must not set up too many subplots or Chekhov guns that one cannot eventually resolve, particularly in the orthodox mystery genre where the reader does expect the Decalogue to be followed and a solution to exist. Given the prolonged delay in the final reveal and continued monologuing from the apparent villain character, I am concerned that the ending will ultimately be a cop out, with perhaps some cliche resolution like "it was all a dream" or "it was all drug-induced paranoia" or "it was a bluff". If so, a reader might justly feel betrayed and certainly not give the tale a positive review in the _Strand_.

I was a little amused by the insinuation that I was the Sanjuro running "Assassination Market" and by Jack's continued high self-esteem ("an extremely competent analyst" no less!), but otherwise, this was getting boring: Jack's threats were even cruder than before, and his claims even less credible. But hey, I enjoyed writing another reply mocking him some more and rubbing his nose in his failure to provide any evidence:

> A reader could hardly ask for a more detailed response from their favorite fictional author! But I fear you became so wrapt in your improvised performance you entirely neglected the original goal: providing any evidence whatsoever of your claims. Zero. How can you possibly expect me or anyone to seriously consider giving you so much as a single bitcoin based on your logorrhea and cryptic threats? Even ordinary blackmailers at least do their victims the courtesy of proving they have what they claim to have. You seem oddly offended that I even ask rather than pay up immediately. This is conducive to one conclusion, as I stated at the beginning of our enjoyable little correspondence: that you are bluffing and you in no wise have the damning evidence you claim to have.
>
> I look forward to the information about Ross, your proof that I am Satoshi, the altcoin material, and the many other fascinating things you have alluded to. Don't disappoint me, Jack! If you can provide a good case for any of that, it will be the bestest Christmas gift ever!
>
> Seriously, for all you say I'm a genius, you must think I'm a moron.

I must not have provoked him as well as I thought, because his reply was the remarkably laconic:

> Godspeed.

_Zut_! Perhaps an insulting pun?

> So. I guess you don't know jack.

Ah, that got more of a response from Jack:

> I do! I know that I promised this was going to be the worst mistake of your life Gwern. This will also be the worst Christmas of your life since you're so seemingly optimistic.
>
> I'll be closing this account now.

And indeed, the `jack0fnone` Reddit account was deleted.

But did the Jack saga end there? No. Fortunately (or unfortunately), on 8:57PM EST 13 December 2013, I received a message from the Reddit user [`satoshispudding`](http://www.reddit.com/user/satoshispudding):

Oh, come on - now I'm supposed to be [Nate Silver](!Wikipedia)‽ This is just too absurd: Silver is a busy man who travels the country and writes books and is constantly analyzing sports (a topic I have close to zero interest in). Nor am I as good at statistics as Silver is. (One day...) I must be quite the mensch to keep all these plates spinning and personas running - "Christ, what an imagination I've got!"

A threat to call 'my' parents or 'Matt' (no idea who that is) is hardly a threat to me. I am sure Jack did not call them anymore than he met with Ulbricht's lawyer. More pathological megalomania and lying. Jack has issues, but I am not qualified to say what they are and no way to intervene, sadly. Is it moral to keep arguing with a nut? Mightn't it nurture their delusions or, in remote scenarios, spur them into violence? Jack had given no evidence that they had found my real identity, so I was no longer worried for my own sake, but Silver is a public figure who could be located and attacked.

Wondering about whether I should finally bring his monologuing to a halt, I chickened out and repeated my previous message with a tweak:

> I look forward to the truth about DPR, your proof that I am Satoshi and Nate Silver, the exchanges I am the mastermind, and the many other fascinating things you have alluded to. Don't disappoint me, Jack! If you can provide a good case for any of that, it will be the bestest Christmas gift ever!

### 14 December

On 9:33 PM, I was graced with another message from `satoshispudding`:

> LOL it was in the name of keeping all spirits lifted so I hope you can understand that I respect a good nights sleep (also get bored). You clearly deserve it since you were foolish enough to gamble away your freedoms straight through into the billion marker. What will your wife say when this all gets going Gwern?
>
> I think you misunderstood me. I made it clear that the evidence I possess demonstrates that you have collaboratively been operating several illicit marketplaces, are orchestrating an unmentionable amount of scams on bitcointalk.org, and operating businesses that are laundering BILLIONS in all of this scam/pre-mined money throughout the world; specifically the US, Japan, UK, and China.
>
> Let's not distract ourselves with the entire list of charges right now, instead let me remind you that this ponzi scheme of yours has left several innocent people in jail and indebted to the courts as I have repeatedly stated. Also, you're *shockingly* responsible for providing fraudulent information to the FBI and the CIA, there's no doubt about the former or latter in your case.

The failure to provide any real evidence is by now predictable, but there are still some interesting features. The mention of "Gavin" can only be a reference to Gavin Andresen, well-known Bitcoin developer, implying that my secret activities & identities are even more exhausting than I thought; Jack inadvertently raises an interesting metaphysical question when he asks what my (nonexistent) wife would think of my crimes; and his numbering scheme is delightfully eccentric (why is lesson #2 so much less important than #3 & #6? and are lessons #4 & #5 too top-secret to tell a man who is "beyond fucked"?).

Regardless, this game was starting to become tiresome. Jack is not saying anything genuinely new, so I quickly replied with another challenge on the evidence:

>> Let's not distract ourselves with the entire list of charges right now
>
> No no, let's distract ourselves! After all, if what you say is true, I will be going to jail for a long time and won't be enjoying myself. Let's get into all the nitty-gritty, like who my wife is or how I am Nate Silver *and* Satoshi Nakamoto *and* Gwern Branwen *and* Gavin Andresen *and* Theymos *and* Fontas, and what proof you have. After all, there's only 2 days left on your deadline, right? Surely there's no harm in posting your dossier publicly. What's a dox between friends?

If he replied with any evidence, the monologue might be worth listening to further, otherwise, it was time to consider drawing this episode to a close.

### 15 December

10 AM:

Therefore my suggestion is that you make time to discuss, first and foremost, the series of unfortunate events that will plague all of you on this bestest Christmas, Gavin.

Note: there's very high certainty on my end that it is not a full disclosure of your dox over lunch/skype with the solutions promised. So, at this point I'd say that I'm 99.999999% sure I'm going to head out East. I'll leave you to brainstorming, Gavin. I'd say you're an incredibly interesting man, but you already know that in detail. Oh hey! Also...can I fill in for you at Zero-Hedge?

I can only shake my head at this - if I'm "obviously not Nate Silver" then what the hell was the "Nate" and "Silver Productions" before about? But Jack seems to be sticking to his 'Natoshi Gwernvin' story in bringing up "Michele Cook-Andresen" (Gavin Andresen's real wife, according to a [_WSJ_ profile of Andresen](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323809304578429142650304564 "Bitcoin vs. Ben Bernanke: The chief scientist for the digital currency talks about its appeal-and pitfalls-in a world of fiat money")) and apparently claiming he has found Gavin's children's names (I did not check this part).

I am troubled at Jack bringing up Gavin's family. In particular, by the "I'm going to head out East" line: Gavin's public profiles like [his Twitter account](https://twitter.com/gavinandresen) state he lives in Amherst, MA - which would indeed be in the "East" for most Americans. So I emailed Andresen a copy of my writeup. I decided it was probably better to not reply further to Jack until I heard back.

### 22 December

After reading it, he gave me permission to publish it and did not seem worried. I sent Jack a final PM:

> Your last message is appalling: you are making threats of violence against identifiable people, their spouses, and their children - you've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

> I do not think you are well. I have shown your monologues to many people, and almost to a man, they find them... *off*. Abnormal. 'Hilarious', 'grandiose', 'megalomaniacal', 'disorganized', 'diseased', 'paranoid-schizophrenic', 'bipolar' - these are the words people use after reading through your messages. Leaving aside the fact that almost all your research is fundamentally wrong, just your writing style alone evinces that you are not alright. I don't know if you suffer from mental illness, or if it is due to the drug you mentioned abusing (methamphetamine?), but you are not well. You may think you are well, or think you are responsibly using your favored drug, or you may even think your problem is a gifted that provides you special insight into the world beyond the norm; but you are not, and it is not. You need to get help before you wreck your own life or another's. It only takes one slip to do something that cannot be undone. Please do something about your problem: if it's drug abuse, get help quitting; if it's undiagnosed schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, there are effective treatments, pharmaceutical and otherwise, for those issues.
